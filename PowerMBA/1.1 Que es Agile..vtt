00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.080
What are the problems that

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.880
Agile is looking to solve?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.060
What we need to know is how to find

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.720
a solution.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.680
What does this methodology consist of?

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.980
It is also important to know in what

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.400
areas within the company it will

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.940
help us.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.420
The best way to understand

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.520
it is to see it as a

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.160
toolbox.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.600
It is a toolbox where you have

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.740
tools of different types that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.900
will then serve you to solve

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.160
these big problems

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.320
at the company level.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440
And in the end it is a kind

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.440
of mindset, a mentality,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.900
a philosophy with which I

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.600
serve as tools to solve these

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.620
big problems.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.640
On the one hand, to be more adaptive and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.980
on the other hand, to keep my talent motivated.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.880
So, in this toolbox,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.160
what students have to know

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.760
is that many have been

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.860
developed.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.480
And some...

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.160
Lean Startup is one of them, but

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.300
Scrum, Kanban are words that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.840
can sound.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.340
It is continuous, because it is a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520
philosophy that starts from a series

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.800
of values that are very easy to understand,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.180
by the way, of adaptability.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.520
There are a number of things we will

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.240
see and there are a lot of tools in it.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
And tools help you to do

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.560
concrete things, like in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.000
a toolbox.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.980
You take the sturdy to sturge

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.360
or whatever, and the drill

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.740
to make holes in the wall.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.980
This is a bit similar.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.660
Now I would like to analyze what

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.200
areas within the company Yael

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.280
helps us in and how the traditional

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
approach versus the Yael

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.040
approach is.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.000
Of all this toolbox, in order

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.800
to use them, they can be divided

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.360
into three large lines.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.720
The first one has to do with the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.480
strategy and is where your company

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.640
will move and at what point

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280
it has to do with the time to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.680
market.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.540
I give you a very concrete example.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.760
Imagine you have a business idea

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.840
and instead of the traditional

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.400
model you talked about before ships

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.800
versus such, you want to explore

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.940
whether that business model is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.860
actually profitable or not.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.340
There are many tools that you can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.460
use, such as Lean Startup, Design

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.300
Sik, etc.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.580
They help you validate whether that business

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580
model is realistic or not, and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.640
you pass early.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.600
As a first benefit, it also

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.780
helps you minimize your

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540
costs, increase your return

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.120
on investment and also meet

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340
your time to market.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.480
It is to come at the opportunity,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.220
at the right time, in the right place.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.060
There are tools such as Design

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.540
Thinking and Lean Startup that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.020
make us a tool to help

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.200
define the company’s strategy.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.460


00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.720
What helps us is to be closer

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.460
to our customers.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.180
I think, and well, that, and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.300
Lean Startup we all know.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.880
Then you don’t stay there because

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.940
in addition to knowing the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.040
strategy, where you’re going to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.120
go and talk to your client,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120
you’ll have to somehow implement

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.880
it, carry it out.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.660
This part of operational, project

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.880
management, are also another series

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.980
of tools that are within that

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.300
same box, which will help us

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.680
then once the strategy is seen,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.300
how we will carry it out,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.540
how you organize the talent,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.040
how we will deliver the product,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.560
how close it will be to the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.200
customer, how I will incorporate

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.560
your feedback within my

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.720
product, always to be

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.960
sure that what I am

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.080
doing has a value.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.120
It helps us manage projects.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.060
Yes, in full.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.700
What are the tools that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.920
help us?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.140
The most famous for managing projects

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.600
are Scrum, which is the say for

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.960
excellence, which has to do more

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.820
with the operational part of the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.260
project.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.600
There is Kanban, which besides

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.560
projects also has the part of

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.160
operations.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.000
And there are other a little more techniques

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.220
such as XP, Stream Programming,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.000
etc.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.060
But they all have a very common goal

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.240
and it’s a bit of Yael’s philosophy,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.820
which is to bring value to the customer.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.140
And for that, he will be very close to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.400
him.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.880
And all the tools that are in the box,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.160
you will see Borja, which will

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.580
always have in common proximity

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.120
with the customer.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.180
That is indisputable.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.060
And last but not least,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.520
because you can have a great

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.960
strategy, you can have a good

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.000
project methodology,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.620
it is to have a proper

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.140
talent.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.640
To have the right talent means

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.780
to recruit the right people

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.060
and to keep them.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.320
We’ve seen before that it’s

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
a problem to keep talent.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.060
Yael also has a series

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.100
of tools inside that box

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.660
that will help us to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.760
get talent to my company,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.480
develop within it and

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.440
help me the goals within

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440
my strategic plan.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.060
And not in vain, if you confirm everything

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.840
that has been collected from Yael

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.120
studies as many years after its

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.040
use, they all go in that direction.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.840
Time to market has been drastically

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.420
reduced.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.820
Businesses are now much more

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.680
able to be close to customers

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.600
and the answers that are

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600
really what they need.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.680
And many of them have managed

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.460
to keep talent and reduce rotation

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.520
considerably.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.540
The number of people who leave

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.540
is much smaller.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.140
And that’s why it’s a philosophy that

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.020
will help you in your company to

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.200
get ahead with those big problems.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.660
Strategy, being a more adaptable

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.580
company, such as Line Startup, for

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.900
example, at a very strategic level

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.300
help us these tools, Line

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.420
Startup, Design Thinking.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.200
At a more operational, more tactical

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.660
level, in the management of

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.860
the different projects we have

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.900
within the company or in the operations.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.900
There are also tools, for example,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.180
such as talks of Scram, which we

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.200
will see, or like Kanban, which helps

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.840
us to be more flexible above all.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.560
All these tools also contribute

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160
to talent management.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.080
It is a different approach to talent

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.060
management where we mainly support

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.620
ourselves in empowering people,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.240
etc.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.480
First think of me, for example, the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.640
case that is never referenced in

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.320
Spain international, which is the BBVA.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.860
Think of the three lines we have

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.980
commented on and think of what

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.180
they have taken out the toolbox.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.200
If you see BBVA’s strategy, it’

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.520
s a digital strategy closer

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.220
to the user and they’re working

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.340
on it with small self-organized

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.020
teams that make product

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.320
constantly.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.420
In fact, you go to an app like

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.960
BBVA on your mobile, see the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.820
versions every day and see

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.580
that they are constantly changing.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.500
These policies have been made,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.820
not only to make strategic

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.240
planning a year, but I do

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.620
it a quarter or a half-year,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.580
that of having small teams

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.000
working close to the customer,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.460
having their need and constantly

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.700
adapting.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.480
And those new policies that empower

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.820
people, where there is no longer

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.380
a boss, who is the only one who

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.160
commands within the project, but

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.720
that everyone is self-coordinated,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.680
everyone is self-managed,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.480
are the features that make a

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.120
company in allay and that are

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.700
currently reporting large profits.
