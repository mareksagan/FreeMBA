00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.980
I was born in Boston, I spent two

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.180
months there because of my parents’

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.840
working circumstances and eventually

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.100
I ended up in Valencia.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.820
I studied there at the institute,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.480
the university and from

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.520
the university, in parallel I had

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.800
an agreement with my parents that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.340
is while drawn good grades can

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.280
do a little what I wanted, out

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.600
of that.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.780
I did a lot of things during

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.980
the ONES and in parallel.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.660
I studied industrial engineering,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.380
organized and then

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.140
competed in business

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.540
plans, etc.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.660
Even having a dance music

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.560
show on Saturday night

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.360
on the radio, things like

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.220
that.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.520
I went to Germany in the summer,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840
I thought I was going to work in a

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.840
factory and ended up mounting

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.160
Latin parties, things like that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.100
very random.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.440
I started doing internships in the last

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.160
year at an industrial company and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.500
then when I finished my career I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.140
started working at BCG as a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840
strategic consultant.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.480
Two years in Madrid and one in London

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.500
and from there I went to MIT.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.160
I made a program called Leaders

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.540
for Global Operations, which is a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.460
program that originated in the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880
1980s as almost competition, as

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.320
a reaction to Japanese competition

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.240
by some industrial partners

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.140
who assembled it jointly

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.240
with MIT.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.440
And then you pay part of the tuition

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.080
and you do two masters, an MBA

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.720
and a master in operations direction.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.760
I thought I would go back

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.240
to work in a company.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.000
And then I started to get a little bit

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.800
of the worm of entrepreneurship and so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.700
I started to turn around things that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.580
would have frustrated me.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.000
And that’s a bit like Pierre Trans

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.800
was born, which was my

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.300
first adventure, when

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.040
I was a little reflecting on my

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.460
personal experience of paying

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.640
tuition to MIT.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.720
Then I was scholarshiped by a foundation,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.440
Caja Madrid, and that made

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.220
the payment.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.040
Then the university had difficulty

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.840
squaring that payment with which

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.640
it was for me.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.500
And then I went up, I went

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.500
down, trying to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.300
fix this.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.540
And then you realize that the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.700
bank has put you in some craving

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.820
on the exchange rate, on

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.100
commissions and so on.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.180
I said that the world is unfair.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.760
In a way, those who know less

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.960
and who can afford less to

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.960
cover them with many commissions

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.680
and so on are the ones who

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.940
end up paying the party,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.440
small, consumers

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.000
and so on.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.080
How much is it to illustrate it?

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.320
What was the amount of commission

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.160
you would pay?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.880
Not in percentage, but in percentage.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.720
A thousand euros.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.360
In a $40,000 payment, you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.440
end up paying $1,000 in that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.180
case, approximately.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.020
So it’s a 5%, with which you say,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.680
oysters, I didn’t know and I just

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.660
lost a thousand dollars.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.580
The exchange rate you get from the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.820
bank is very different from what

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.360
is on the market.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.480
And it’s a reference that when one

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.080
thinks of value proposal, cost

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.360
savings, it’s very easy when

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.640
everyone knows how much you cost

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.560
a coffee, more or less.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.400
If someone buys you, they charge you 10

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.060
times more.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.300
And if I’m used to paying a euro and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.320
a half for a coffee and someone

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.780
charges me 15 euros, I’m saying,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.580
“Hey, uncle, you’re stealing

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.360
me, right?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.500
But the type of change and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.320
with many things they quote, are

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.140
constantly changing.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.140
So I would tell you, hear, is 1.45

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.860
a good type of 1 dollar exchange or

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.400
not?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.360
Oysters, I don’t know, you’ll have to look

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.100
at it, right?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.560
It is not something immediate.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.680
So, there, that is an advantage

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.100
to not create transparency in

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.540
the market, for consumers.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.720
And then I said, hear, then

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.980
why not create the alternative

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.840
to bank transfer?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.320
Why not a little do something that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.960
isn’t necessarily the bank

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.620
doing that currency conversion?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.580
So a little bit of peer transfer was born.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.460
And originally, even the name Peer

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.960
Transfer, I saw it as a peer-to-peer

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.900
network that is, basically,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.580
I come from Spain to the United

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.840
States, I am sending money, other

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.480
people are sending money from

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.840
the United States to Spain, because

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.820
we do not clean and cross those

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.240
transactions and directly

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.220
prevent money from moving internationally

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.420
and moving domestically.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.940
So that was a bit of what I started

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.540
with.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.840
And I said, oysters, what innovative, what

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.700
disruptive, what such, right?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.100
This is a peer-to-peer network in this.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.620
It was a C2C platform,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.040
right?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.740
Yes, it could be corporate too.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.300
Because almost more a peer-to-peer

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.740
where there are different participants

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.300
who eventually clean up transactions.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.800
And then a little, that’s how I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.920
made the first experience, and at

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.780
one point I said, oysters, it makes

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.580
sense, right?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.040
At the end you have the debate

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.900
of, we are in a world that we are

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.340
always a little there with the ear

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.440
raised to see if someone loves

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440
it, right?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.500
When you see an ad that says, it doesn’

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.260
t know which is cheaper, the best, right?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400
See if this is true or not?

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.260
So sometimes when you run one of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.400
the you are explained why it’

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.280
s cheaper or why it’s better at

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.380
least allows a understanding

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.120
to the other side, right?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.560
Say, well, hear, because I don’t know,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.340
you don’t have a building, so you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.340
save money on having a building

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.380
and therefore you give me something

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.940
cheaper.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.980
Okay, I understand it, right?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.080
But there’s a bit of the

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.200
complexity between, if I explain

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.880
how I’m adding complexity to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.920
your understanding of the business

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.940
and if I don’t explain it to you,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.740
it might generate you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.440
distrust, right?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.700
Then I have a little there the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.180
dilemma because at one point I

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.080
realized that this cleaning was very

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.380
good but as soon as you start to have

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.920
scale and you start to get

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920
very good exchange rates and

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.740
in the end it is not relevant, better

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.900
margin, but it is not fundamental

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.740
to build a business.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.140
I have decided to simplify

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.120
this.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.740
Say, hear, look, we can give you a

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.780
much cheaper exchange rate because we

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.640
don’t have offices and yes, it’ll

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.480
get in a lot, right?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.620
It is an online business, with

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.820
more modern technologies, etc.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.880
And then I started helping

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.180
small and consumers.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.240
This was a bit of everything that happened

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.280
in the last year of the MBA.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.280
I started helping

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.840
small.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.500
And then talking to the universities,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.980
almost, hear, look, please,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.860
could you like to tell some of

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.200
these students that they use us

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.960
and so on?

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.820
One thing is very important

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.960
to me, and that is the...

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.380
sometimes the flexibility to adapt

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.380
your business mode according to what

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.880
you learn at the same time as tenacity.
