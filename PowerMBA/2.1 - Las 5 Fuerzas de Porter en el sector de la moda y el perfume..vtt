00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Silvia, let's analyze the profitability in the perfume industry,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
or perhaps the evolution of profitability, from the perspective of the five forces of Porter.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm going to ask you.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
As you told me before, the loyalty of consumers has decreased.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
This means that the power of the consumer is greater,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
and you require a permanent development of products,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
and more money spent on communication, etc.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Therefore, the profitability is low.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Yes and no.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
It is true that until now we have been developing

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
according to what the brand thought the consumer had to offer.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And that in market research, in terms of what they were looking for,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
it would require an investment, a spending.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Now we have a great advantage,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
and it is precisely because of that bidirectional relationship with the consumer

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
that we can spend less money.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Because he himself, proactively, tells you what he wants.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
So that has a huge advantage,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
at the expense level, at the time level, and at the level of getting it right.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes, that is an advantage, being closer.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
For example, the fact that customers are less loyal,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
and I understand that this is always the case in all sectors,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
increases the competitive struggle.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Because when the customer is loyal for life,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
you don't have to be fighting with the brand next door.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
On the other hand, in this case, I imagine that the competitive war,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
the price war, etc., will have increased over the years.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yes.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Obviously, you have to be more innovative,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
and I insist again, go more to what the customer is really looking for.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, get it right more.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Before, you developed for everyone,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
and now your creativity has to be based not on developing a product that you think of globally,

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
but you have to develop multiple products right now,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
that go specifically according to each of the consumers.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And I insist again, it is very important, not only the product,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
it is a matter of communication, that it is very personalized.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It is a matter of visual merchandising,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
approach the consumer in a personalized way.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
So, your creativity really has to overflow and be brutal.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Of course, every time the strength of the customers,

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
the non-loyalty, requires greater efforts from all brands.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I mean, it makes what we sometimes call the red ocean,

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
the competition, bigger, because if you don't make those efforts, you are left out.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Another factor that influences you, and that negatively influences profitability,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
is the arrival of products, we could call them substitutes,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
because they are almost substitutes, such as replicas, for example.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
But I don't know to what degree it affects.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It affects us brutally, both what replicas are,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
and what facifications are,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
such as, for example, that parallel market we have of testers.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The replicas, so that we understand each other,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
are those products that seem to smell like air, like essence, like Pouhon,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
but it seems to have the same composition,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
that they seem to be made with the same ingredients,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
and they have absolutely nothing in common.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yes, but they are legal, they are sold in stores that are franchises.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
They are legal, but they are sold in a standard bottle,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and you buy it for 9 euros, while we are selling it for 90, or 50, or whatever.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
But it really doesn't smell like air, it seems to smell like air,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
but it doesn't have the smell, or the persistence, etc.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Then, on the other hand, we have all that online world of falsifications,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
which does us a lot of damage, not only in terms of sales,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
but also in terms of brand image.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Because, even though you know that you are not buying the replica,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
in the falsifications you think you are buying the replica.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So, you are buying a product that has the same bottle,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
that you think is the same bottle,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
and that you think what is inside is exactly the same.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
So, neither the same bottle, nor the packaging is carefully made,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
and then, the worst thing is that, as a consumer,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
you are putting a perfume on your skin,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
knowing what it is made of.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
So, it probably has a series of chemical components,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
that in many cases can cause you an allergy.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
So, at the brand image level,

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
I as a brand, am seeing something that really does not fit my quality standards.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
But at the consumer level, the worst thing is that you are buying

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
a product that you think you are wearing,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
that is the good one,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and it is causing you a series of allergic reactions,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
or it does not last, or it does not persist what you think,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
or it does not smell as you think it should smell.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So, at the brand image level,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
that you think it is a good product,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
it is doing me a lot of damage.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
And then, of course, we have what are the sales in parallel

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
that we are finding of testers.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
The testers are those products that are real for sale,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
that are delivered in the distribution,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and the customer directly tests it,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
and if he likes the perfume, he takes it.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, we are finding online testers sales.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
There are even physical stores that also put it,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
that it is a testers sale.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
But it is illegal.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It is illegal.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
And there are physical stores.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
There are physical stores.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
So, the worst of all is that this should be regulated,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
it should be prohibited, because even as a consumer,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
we put in the products,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
tester prohibited from sale.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I understand that this is not as big as the previous ones.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And then there is another force that I also think

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
that is negatively affected,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and it is the power of your distributor,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
of your distribution channel.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
How does that affect?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
How does it evolve?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
In the same way that I insist again,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I think that distribution,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
as it is understood today,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
or as we have been working with it,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I think that if it is not going to die,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
it is going to evolve or change a lot.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Also what is true,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
that we are realizing lately,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
is that this distribution is concentrating.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Large distribution groups are being created.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Perfumeries, chains of perfumeries,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
are joining together.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Large distribution groups are being created.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
With which, that implies that at the level of strength,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
as a collaborator,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
because you don't have to understand it as a supplier,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
but really as a collaborator,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
we are taking a very important force

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
at the level of negotiations.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Also, opportunities that they offer us

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
in terms of possibilities

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
of larger sales points,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
of larger spaces.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
That is, I mean,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
that not only do you have to see the negative advantages,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
that the policies are more strict or more rigid,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
or that it requires you much more commercially,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
in terms of conditions,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
but also that it offers you many more possibilities.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
It offers you something too, but it offers it to everyone.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Yes, it offers it to everyone.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The best position.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Indeed, you said it, the best position.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
If we do an analysis,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
if we make a summary of profitability

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
from the point of view of the forces of Porter,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
we find that it reduces the loyalty of customers,

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
that it is true that it requires continuous developments of I plus D,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
more spending.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
This also reduces the loyalty of customers,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
it makes the competitive war greater,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
because the brands are fighting

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
in a red ocean,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
permanently having to innovate, etc.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Profitability drops, obviously.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Compared to when, in the 70s,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
you were almost alone in Spain, etc.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Distribution is concentrated,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
which is what tightens you more,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
because it has more strength than before.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And finally, also,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
substitutive products,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
such as replicas,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
such as falsifications,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and even parallel markets of testers.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Therefore, if we analyze the forces that are affecting us,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
the outlook is worse than a few years ago,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
let's say that it has affected you negatively

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
in terms of profitability.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Yes, but it also offers you many opportunities.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
But to everyone.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Yes, to everyone, obviously.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
But they are opportunities that you have to play

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
at the level of what we said before,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
of the intrinsic of the brand,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
of the strength of the brand.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
This red ocean requires you

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
to have a very powerful brand

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
with very powerful values,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
because otherwise you cannot compete.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Obviously.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But it also allows you to work

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
the world, at least in our case, of perfume,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
not only at the level of what the product itself is,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
but at the level of the whole experience,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
which I think is fundamental

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
in all segments,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
in the world of perfume,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
and in the world of luxury.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Obviously, it is especially important.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
that innovation

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
that many people in the past

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
always said,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I have to create a new feminine perfume,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
we always saw it at the level of the world

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
of physical perfume,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Teo Abbrey,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the possibility of saying,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
no, let's go to the world of experiences,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
let's see the characteristics,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
what the OEB offers,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
what others can offer,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
and let's work on that.
