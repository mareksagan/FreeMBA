00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.970
Carlos, you have already helped

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.870
us draw the vision, to see where

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.450
we want to get, but we have to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.690
do another analysis now.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.270
So is it.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.370
And it is an internal analysis to

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.510
know ourselves better, because

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.850
depending on whether we know each

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.710
other better or worse, we will make

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.570
better or worse decisions.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.730
So is it.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490
If they are more aligned with

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.490
our characteristics, that is something

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.570
very important.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.390
If Messi had been put to play basketball,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.890
I don't know if he's about 65

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.950
or so, because it't be what

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.290
he is.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.070
It's an extreme example, but I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.830
think we all need to do that effort.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.410
The goal is to know what our

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.390
strengths, our weaknesses

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.590
and what is what motivates

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.230
us most.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.810
So is it.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.610
How will we do it?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.570
Look, it is called the journey

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.570
to the past and it really deepens

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.650
into this that many ancient philosophers

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.450
have said is fundamental,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.190
that is know yourself,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.450
as Socrates said.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.930
What is the journey to the past?

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.910
It consists of Step number

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.470
one, identifying all

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.850
experiences, not only

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.350
professional, but also some

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.190
personal, now I will put some

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.910
examples, which have happened

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.690
in our lives since we are very young.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.650
All the jobs, of course.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.250
And besides that, if I was

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.950
the captain of a football team,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230
if I was part of a choir in school,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.510
if I gave private classes,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.110
if I was a swimming pool monitor,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.990
then that too.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.110
And identify the experiences

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.090
first, make the complete list.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.470
That is step number one.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.250
The most important experiences.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.210
They are not the most important ones,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.250
they are those that are relevant

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.430
where we have performed some activity.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.410
and relevant.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.650
Where we have performed some

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.910
activity, I say, all the work

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.890
and non-working activities

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.610
that have to do with our

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.370
hobbies, having formed part

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.810
of some team or having

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.350
developed any type of activity,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.230
hobby or hobby.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.770
That is the first.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.750
And after each of those, which

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.450
can be a significant number, so

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.490
this exercise takes time and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.690
that you have to reserve a time

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.270
to do it, you have to do the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.890
following.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.630
You need to fill out a data

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.270
table in which we will put what

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.210
the experience consists of,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730
when it happened, is important,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.770
at what time.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.570
We must always go from the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.110
oldest to the newest.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.770
And then, what has been?

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.150
The three things we liked

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.150
about this experience?

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.250
The best memory we have but written

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.390
with a level of detail, as if I

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.890
was telling the story to a friend

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.890
and telling how I felt, what

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.090
I thought, with whom I interacted,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.950
what happened, what was

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.710
the moraleja, etc.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.350
And then the three things I liked

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.870
least, the ones I really hated,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.190
the ones I would have removed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.830
from that experience if I could.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.350
A global rating is a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.410
global rating that can be

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.350
from 0 to 10.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.490
That is, summarizing, what, when,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.890
three things better, the best memory

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.690
with a higher level of detail possible,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.690
the worst, the three things that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.870
I have least liked and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.990
the overall evaluation.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.310
I'm going to do a very fast incise and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.990
I'm going to do it on the walk

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.410
because I haven't done this exercise.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.430
I was a basketball coach when

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.250
I was between 15 and 17, I think

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.130
more or less.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.070
The three good things, I learned

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.810
a lot of children's leadership

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.470
topics that I never did again.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.170
I learned that I liked training

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.470
more than playing well and I it a lot.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.610
Do you remember any specific moment?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.170
It is a key moment of the experience.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.450
I remember a game where we

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.430
struck the opposing team, which

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.810
was not the goal of struck,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.590
but in which we all realized

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.910
that the effort we were

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.650
doing all, we as coaches and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.390
they that we had achieved

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.170
that motivation, despite

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.690
being very incredible kids,

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.270
that effort was having

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.630
a reward and we were the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.770
best team without a doubt.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.590
It was the fruit of the fact that the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.230
children were more talented, that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.350
it could be, but that teamwork,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.130
effort and so on has its consequences.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.390
Three bad things, I don't remember

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.730
now, maybe I imagine having to get

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.810
up on Saturdays soon had come out

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.910
on Friday or something like that

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.130
and a global rating of 0 to 10,

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.270
an 8 for example.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.830
I just wanted to tell it quickly

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.530
to illustrate how the analysis

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.030
of such an experience

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.370
is.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.530
It's an example that goes perfectly

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.390
for us, the theme is that you've

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.150
done it from an experience, you've

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.330
done it quickly, when this is

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.590
done slowly and it's done from

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.750
all the experiences we've had,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.150
patterns emerge and that's the next

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.210
exercise we're going to propose

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.770
to our audience and it's that

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.530
they identify the patterns that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.350
emerge, what they are, what I'm

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.330
strong about.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.150
The Fortress.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.970
The Fortress.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.110
Weaknesses also emerge, what

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.590
I don't like or feel uncomfortable

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.710
with, and what motivates

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.010
me also emerges.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.970
For in your case you discovered that motivated

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.990
you or you were much better training

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.350
than playing and it was a discovery

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.470
you made, I don't know if that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.950
then has served you in the future

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.910
to do other things but it's a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.110
pattern that has emerged.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.610
Then you have to identify strengths,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.850
weaknesses and the things

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.170
that motivate you based on the

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.910
patterns that emerge.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.430
I knew I was able to lead,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.170
especially to motivate.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.310
Perfect, yes, more or less about

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.330
a children's team, is important.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.450
That exercise, I tell you, gives you a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.450
lot of information about yourself

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.390
and you will surely discover things

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.530
you didn't know.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.630
Because you may have left something

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.370
bad that if you think better,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.410
imagine.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.010
In this case, for example, I don't

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.290
know if you were receiving any

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.450
kind of financial compensation or

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.850
session important to you or simply

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.790
did it in an altruistic way.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.490
Yes I received.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.970
But you may not be happy with

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.150
the relationship of effort,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.230
time, money or reward either.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.330
But that already, each has to

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.830
do his own reflection to see if

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.310
it really is what you value most

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.470
and what motivates you.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.610
I am sure that if then, with a little

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.350
more detail, there is no time now

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.390
to do so, the analysis or the consequences

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.290
will be much richer

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.550
in terms of strengths, weaknesses

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.550
and motivations,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.310
I am sure.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.930
More complete, more accurate and allows

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.950
you to make decisions.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.050
The second step that we will

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.310
be proposing is to apply it to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.990
the workplace.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.410
So, let's say, what we want

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.670
to do professionally and what

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.350
we are doing now.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.210
And for that, what's good is to

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.290
ask these three questions.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.550
Choose the two things that have those

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.330
experiences for you.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.590
Two, only two, the ones that have

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.170
motivated you more.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.590
Now we have the full picture.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.470
When you have the full photo,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.330
of course, this you have to

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.430
do once you have the full photo.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.390
The second question is, in your current

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.690
job, do you have much or little

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.430
of that?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.870
Analyze it a little more.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.950
So why do you have so much?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.730
Why do you have little?

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.090
What do you mean by much or little?

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.210
What would you miss?

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.130
What are you satisfied with and what are

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.510
you not?

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.570
And you can do that matching, that

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.350
correspondence.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.330
I will give an example to help.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.510
I am no longer thinking of myself.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.830
Imagine a person has identified

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.150
that what he has most liked

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.690
in his life has been creating

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.130
new ideas, thinking, etc.,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.030
and relating to other people.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.510
And it turns out that in your current

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.410
job you have no possibility

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.070
to do either.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.050
Because he works alone, I don't know.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.510
Yes, you do not have the opportunity

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.690
to interact with people in your daily

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.410
working life and, in addition, because

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.030
you may not be allowed to make decisions

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.210
or you can not put these new

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.250
ideas into practice.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.230
In this case, there is a need

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.390
for change, a change in the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.090
workplace.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.970
I don't know if it's not possible in

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.230
the short term, but in the medium

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.090
term you have to change because

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.910
otherwise you'll feel very frustrated.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.950
Because it is totally in

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.610
dissonance with the analysis it

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.090
has made of what are its strengths

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.970
and motivations.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.330
And the third question is, what kind

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.830
of work, future or business can be a

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.570
business, would give you more to take

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.230
advantage of your strengths, to minimize

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.990
the effect of weaknesses and,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.230
above all, to increase your

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.850
motivation to the maximum?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.510
So that allows you to connect

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.970
it with the exercise we have

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.990
done before from the airport

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.590
to know if in the future work

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.150
I am really painting a picture

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.730
that is in line with that

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.290
type of work that matches

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.570
my strengths, weaknesses

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.890
and motivations.
