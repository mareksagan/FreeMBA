WEBVTT

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.640
We’ll be able to use the

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.040
Lean Startup method by Eric

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.940
Rice and the Customer Development

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900
method by Steve Blank.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840
It always comes from a vision,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.200
an idea.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.760
Every entrepreneur has a vision.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.820
But really, the key, the key to success

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.980
is that that idea involves a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.980
series of hypotheses or assumptions.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.840
That is, to turn that idea into a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.700
profitable business model, there

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.680
are a number of hypotheses inherent

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.920
to that idea.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.460
For example, we want to build an

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.880
app where people make reservations

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.720
at restaurants, to say something.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.420


00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.560
Well, because for that idea to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.800
become a profitable business

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.680
model are implicit a series

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.120
of hypotheses such as that

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.700
our customers, users will see

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.200
value in the application.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.400
They will use it repeatedly.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.340
They will recommend it to their friends.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.040
They will use it to make

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.780
reservations, etc., etc.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.340
There are many possibilities.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.180
It is a matter of decomposing an idea

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.100
in numerous hypotheses.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.320
Therefore, as we have to have

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.940
very clear that hypotheses, those

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.640
assumptions are an absolutely

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.140
determining factor.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.020
This is a factor that we need to analyze.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.720
Therefore, the goal, the true

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.480
goal of Lean Startup or Customer Development

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.100
is to learn as soon as possible

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.900
and spend as little money

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.180
as possible if of all those

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.140
hypotheses, those hypotheses

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.300
that we have projected, which

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.820
we have assumed, which

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.920
of them are madness, we have

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.420
been wrong and in which we

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.500
are on the right path.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.900
This is the goal and we must do

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.480
it as soon as possible and spend

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.720
as little as possible.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.420
It is absolutely different from

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.140
the traditional methodology

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.840
in which you create the product

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.260
and until you create the product,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.420
it takes a lot of time, you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.280
develop the whole product and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.140
you have no customer feedback until

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.380
you go to the market.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.180
Let’s see how it works.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.820
The first thing we need to do

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.540
is to identify these possibilities.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120
I will summarize that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.860
mainly there are two hypotheses or they

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440
can be grouped into two groups.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.440
The hypotheses related to value,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.680
whether your product generates value

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.260
to customers, if they perceive value

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.100
and the hypothesis related to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.660
growth, if in addition to generating

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.000
value you are able to grow and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.740
capture enough customers to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.280
have a profitable business.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.400
We will see it in more detail.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.680
We’ll do some exercise to learn

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.980
to identify hypotheses because

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.280
it’s super important.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880
From these hypotheses, what we have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.100
to do is test them or validate

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.460
them and we will do so through

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.560
experiments.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.540
That is, we’ll do concrete

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.760
experiments to identify

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.700
whether that hypothesis is implicit

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.880
in your business model,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.980
whether you’re right or not.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.140
We will do so with the least possible

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.960
product.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240
We will also see it in detail.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.380
And how will we do it?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660
As Steve Blank said, get out of the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.100
building.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.640
You have to leave the office.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.220
You have to interact with customers.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.600
At that point, you can say whether

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.860
a hypothesis is valid

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.320
or not.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.080
While you are in the office,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.320
you have no proof to do so.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.940
We will therefore do so as soon

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.640
as possible.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.680
We need to go out to the market

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.540
and interact with customers.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.040
We’ll be very creative, you’ll see.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.500
From those experiments we will

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.720
measure the results, we will

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.360
get insights, we will get ideas,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.420
we will get conclusions that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.500
will allow us to make decisions

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.520
about whether to continue where

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.240
we were going because that hypothesis

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.780
we have validated that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.860
we were in the right or

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.760
change it, pivot, iterate.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.280
This is true of all factors

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.620
within the business

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.160
model.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.560
We may have been wrong about

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.400
what our customer segment

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.880
was.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.480
I thought it was a 25-35 year

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.960
old, but I didn’t.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.540
The most valuable are those between 35 and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.940
40 years old.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.760
We thought they were in urban areas

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
and it turns out they are in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.400
rural areas.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.940
We may think that the promotions

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.000
would have a lot of impact

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and they don’t.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.860
Or that certain functionalities of

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.920
our product were not necessary

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.880
and are, or vice versa.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.120
We are going to change our

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.700
business model and evolve

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.840
our business model.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.900
We will do it permanently.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.220
And what we will do is validate

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.900
all the hypotheses until we come

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.160
up with a business model that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.980
we know we have validated, that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.020
it brings value, that it will grow,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.100
that it is profitable, etc.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.880
As you can see, this methodology, as

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440
we saw in the previous class, is

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.380
about looking.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.780
We are really looking to find

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.220
a business model that is profitable

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.940
and sustainable.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.900
It’s not about executing an idea,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.620
a business plan we had, no.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.640
All the opposite.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.040
It is a very iterative process

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.420
in which we will evolve

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.800
our business model permanently

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.160
until we find it.
