00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.670
Before we analyze Nonavox from a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.350
more technical perspective and try

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.150
to draw some conclusions,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.830
I would like you to tell us a little

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.610
about what it consists of.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.330
First, what are your customer

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.290
segments?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.370
Nonavox had two customer segments.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.830
On the one hand, in our case it was

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470
a subscription model aimed at the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.170
segment of pregnant women and moms

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.550
of babies up to two years, moms

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.550
and dads, and on the other

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.110
hand it was also one because

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.590
our customers were all brands

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.750
that had products aimed at

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.370
our B2C customer segment.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770
Well, that is, connecting, I would almost

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.730
say that it is a platform, it has two

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.430
sides, that you connect moms and dads,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.350
that I understand that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.730
they are basically moms, which you

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.670
said for decency.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.090
Yes, there was as much as 2% of dads.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.130
Because it’s more politically

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.950
correct and with brands that

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.270
sell products targeted to that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.090
customer segment.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.850
What do you offer to one and what do you

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.470
offer to others?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.090
We solved two problems.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.990
To pregnant women and moms we solved

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.950
the problem of, especially in the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.250
cases of first-born moms,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.770
you get pregnant and suddenly you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.510
get a lot of questions and you enter

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.810
a sector where there are very many

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.730
products, five different types

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.970
of tatin, five different types of

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.690
panels, that if they are braguita

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.830
panels, that if they are such,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.930
that if they are not know how

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.450
much organic, creams, that is,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.330
you enter a universe of products

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.710
in which you know nothing and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.030
of which you usually do not

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.290
have time to research.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.410
In the end, it requires

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.050
to do tremendous market research

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.490
to get to the best products.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.830
Then in a box what I did was, hear,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.790
every month we will go sending the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.970
products appropriate to the stage

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.130
of pregnancy or the age of the baby

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.130
and your preferences so that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.670
you do not have to waste time

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.150
looking and so you can try them

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.790
comfortably in your home.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.590
And we solved the problem

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830
of this brutal competition.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.870
It’s a super-segmented market

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.550
with a lot of players on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.150
every product vertical where

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.650
all brands fight for being

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.910
in the top of mind of moms

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.170
and many of them also didn’

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.630
t have the digital skills

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.890
to get it.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.950
Then we offered brands

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.470
the way to reach their potential

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.230
customers directly, people

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.430
who had told us they were

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.210
interested, for example,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.490
in using a whisper, because

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.990
we sent the product

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.530
to brands, but then

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.170
we did a market study

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.350
because our clients were

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.950
encouraged by a point

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.410
system to answer questions

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.570
about the product that

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.730
had sent us to the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.690
brand.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.570
How are revenue generated?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.230
You said subscribers pay

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.050
a quota.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.590
Did you have any income from

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.110
the marks?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.970
On the part of the marks.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.050
Income or Expense?

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.310
Income or expenditure, no one.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.450
That is, brands gave the products

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.270
to the boxes of reaching their

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.690
potential customers and of that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.410
market study that we offered

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.510
them then with the customer

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.710
responses to having

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.050
used their products.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.950
We came to monetize in some

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.890
cases, in more specific

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.690
cases, when brands used

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.250
us to test different markets.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.650
In a couple of occasions Spanish

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.610
brands used us to test,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.210
for example, the German market.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.570
So, as we had customers in Germany,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.810
they sent 5000 products there

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.090
and that market study because they

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.330
directed it to the interest that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.970
could be generated in that country.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.370
I understand that that line of that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.670
income stream you could have developed

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.250
much more, but let’s say that

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.490
it’s actually not the core.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.530
The core was the 25 euros a month

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.450
a client pays.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.990
The key yesterday was, of course,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.330
the clients were receiving surprises boxes.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.350
The customers didn’t know what

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.510
products they would get in the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.390
box the next month.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.410
So, at the level of perceived

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.210
value, the value proposal was,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.570
you’re going to pay 25 euros, you

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.890
don’t know what you’re going to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.770
receive, but we commit to what

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.010
you’re going to receive is at least

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.670
twice the value of what you’

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.190
ve paid.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.850
That is, at least, the products in

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.630
the box will be worth 50 euros and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.990
normally were around 60 to 70 euros

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.030
and, in addition, we commit

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.370
to that it will be interesting

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.330
content and that it will be 100%

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.670
adapted to your stage of pregnancy,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.010
the age of your baby and your

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.510
preferences and that we will

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.790
never repeat the products.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.150
One doubt that arises to me is, the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.750
value that customers perceived is by

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.310
knowing products or by using the products

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.310
themselves.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.990
There were two legs.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.390
I was on the foot of, hear, it is

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.010
that I am discovering products that

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.470
allow me to be the most guay mom in

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.630
the park or kindergarten because,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.710
suddenly, my child carries a super

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.570
niche French brand that has just

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.490
arrived in Spain or I have discovered

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.530
a super innovative product

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.090
that is still not known in

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.870
Spain.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.550
And, on the other hand, there

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.390
was the cholo mentality we all

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.590
have.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.050
Of course, you hear, it is that

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.110
I am paying 25 euros and only this peluche

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.150
that has come to me in the box is

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.730
already worth 25 euros, but it is

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.690
that, in addition, I have a cream,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.150
I have a potito and I have two

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.570
more toys and a cream between

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.670
stars for me, you know?

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.150
Then it was those two mentalities

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.310
that were very good because they

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.690
allowed us to cover a very

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.590
wide segment of customers.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.270
It was my mom who thought that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.090
what was most valuable was that, you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.270
hear, because I am discovering

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.730
a super exclusive fragrance for

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.110
my baby or a super innovative,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.750
super technological product.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.830
And my mom was saying, hear,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.970
that this cream of 15 euros

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.410
has already paid me for

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.970
what I have paid.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.490
What would you say were the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.170
key metrics of the business model?

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.070
Clarely, I believe, as in all, but

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.310
in this case more, being a recurring

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.530
business, the cost of capture,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.150
but, above all, the recurrence,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.030
that costumer life value and the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.650
churn, that, in addition,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.830
the churn, we did an analysis

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.870
of cuts and the churn allowed

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.010
us to see the quality

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.830
of the boxes.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.210
That is, at the end we had an Excel

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.130
in which we saw, you hear, because

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.530
if we already know that the clients

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.850
stay with us, it depended on the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.150
country, but the average was 14

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.850
months.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.690
14 months is high.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.570
That was our big challenge, that is,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.090
the big challenge and all that allowed

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.030
us to load ourselves to

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.050
the competition in many countries

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.030
was the algorithm we developed that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.670
allowed us to make 250 types of

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.670
boxes different angles.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.750
These 250

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.130
Yes, because you get a box that doesn’

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.890
t quarter you and you automatically disabout.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.330
In fact, that was the main reason

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.730
why they were giving up their

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.150
hands, that was why.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.570
I think of one of the classes

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.850
we’ve seen in The Power

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.950
MBA and are the different

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.970
growth engines.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.870
So, depending on the growth engine,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.790
it is necessary to understand it

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.530
very well and monitor some metrics

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.510
or others.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.290
So, there is one that is called

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.890
sticky or sticky and in which

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.710
the company has to be obsessed

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.610
with the lifetime, not only

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.230
with the economic value,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.810
but with the time limit

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.610
and has to permanently monitor

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.910
the churn rate.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.110
And so what you say, that was an

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.150
absolute almost obsession,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.750
because based on those churn rate

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.250
shortcuts you had to analyze whether

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.710
you were delivering boxes of

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.830
higher quality or less.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.810
Just because our product changed

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.870
every month and every month we

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.650
launched a new product and the

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.710
success that had that product,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.950
the acceptance that had, would

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.310
depend on the number of customers

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.810
we had the following month.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.950
That is, it wasn’t like a

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.430
cosmetic company that has the same

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.010
cream and sells it every month.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.130
In our case, we had a product

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.330
that was continuously evolving

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.410
and we had to be continuously

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.210
learning and improving.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.870
Then, the churn was the key metric,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.990
because in the end people are disabling,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.290
they are subscribing again.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.450
Sometimes they give you reasons for

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.830
not being dismissed because I’ve

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.330
been forgotten, but the numbers don’

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.170
t fail, the numbers don’t lie.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.890
So, that churn metric, we knew

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.550
we had a churn of 8%, if it went

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.830
up a little, that automatically

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.190
led us to look first at the quality

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.810
of the box and if not, the

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.790
logistical parner.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.110
Back again to the class

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.970
conclusions we saw about the growth

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.890
engine, one of the conclusions

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.930
I said about this Sticky growth

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.950
engine is that you worry

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.630
less about the CPA, all the

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.330
metrics have to worry you,

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.050
but it’s almost better to

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.030
focus on one.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.870
And if you think of a box with a monthly

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.790
ARPU of 25 euros, I don’t know

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.090
what your CPA was, but the key,

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.070
really the lever, the real lever

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.590
is the churn, that is, because with

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.290
25 euros a month you get to stay

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.950
5 months more, that’s much more

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.810
sensitive than the CPA, which can

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.550
raise you 5 or 10 euros, I don’

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.250
t know, you know?

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.210
If the churn is the quality

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.250
of the product and if

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.330
the product is good,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.770
the CPA is down.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.470
Because you end up viralizing more,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.010
if moms are delighted they are your

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.750
best ambassadors, but if you

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.070
send a bad box a month will affect

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.170
you also the CPA, because you

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.970
will start creating a bad online

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.330
reputation that will make

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.990
you cost you a lot more to

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.810
get customers.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.550
We, of course, at the end was a product,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.590
one, which was not necessary

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.750
and two, which was as very mysterious,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.990
because I said people hostage, that

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.330
I will pay 25 euros a month for

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.950
something I don’t know what is what

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.750
they will send me.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.310
So, in our case, the prescription

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.750
of the clients we already had was

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.590
fundamental because it was what generated

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.610
the new clients security

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.410
of the value, I will pay 25

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.810
euros, I do not know what they

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.110
will send me, but all these are

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.330
happy with what they have

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.210
received.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.810
So, for us to send a bad box was

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.610
an absolute drama because you

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.070
not only lost the clients you

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.490
already had, but started to fill

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.750
the web with bad comments about

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.150
your box and automatically raised

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.970
the CPA of the new clients because

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.090
it cost you a lot more

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.410
to give the credibility

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.730
that they came with you.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.430
What was the CPA?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.870
The average CPA was 15 euros.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.530
If we think so, it is very clear.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.930
The important thing was not the CPA,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.210
because you would take out 25 euros per

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.090
month for each customer.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.610
Only you can improve a little the

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.730
product and lower the soil a little

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.850
and that instead of 10 months,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.750
to say something, when you are 15,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.830
because every month you get more,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.130
you are already, is that you are

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.570
exceeding the cost of customer

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.550
acquisition.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.210
In addition, by the business model,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.230
like the product that went inside

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.490
the boxes we got it without

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.750
cost of the brands.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.910
Our costs were only shipping,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.310
boxing and picking.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.790
That is, nothing more, we had some

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.310
margins, depending also on the country,

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.770
but of a 60, a 65%.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.570
Then, of course, that impact on the

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.070
costumer live value was immediately

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.450
noticed by having such high

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.210
margins.
