00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.710
This class will help you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.710
better understand the reality

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.990
or functioning of any company.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.790
It will help you become a better analyst.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.270
The cash flow, in the state of treasury,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090
as we will see in the next

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.630
class, is broken down into three

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.230
flows.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.650
The flow of transactions, the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.910
flow of investment and the flow

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.630
of financing.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.950
Let us see what the perspective is.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.190
As we have mentioned, all

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.110
activity within a company can

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.610
be categorized into three

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.790
large groups that are

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.230
operations, investment and financing.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.250
And it will help a lot that

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.770
from now on you are able to think

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.990
about a company like this.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.810
Let's say you are able to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.870
separate causes and effects and

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.490
activities within each block.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.310
We are studying it within the course

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.710
of accounting and within the state

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.870
of treasury in particular because

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.510
the state of treasury informs us

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.950
of three types of cash flows that

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.730
coincide with these three activities.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.450
Operations, Investment and Finance.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.570
We start with the operations.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.930
What do we mean by operations?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.090
We are talking about the daily activity

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.210
of the company.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.010
We refer to the purchase of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.550
goods, to the payment of employees,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.750
we refer to the sale of services

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.790
or the sale of products,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.590
to the charges, etc.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.210
The first step in analyzing a

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.330
company is its operations.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.910
We need to make sure that the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.670
operations are generating cash.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.590
In many cases, when companies

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.630
are seen with problems in their

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.730
operations, in their commercial

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.050
activity, imagine that prices have

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.930
fallen or that production costs

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.650
have been shot, well, because

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.970
they are forced to resort to other

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.810
mechanisms related to the other

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.230
two perspectives or activities

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.790
such as investment or

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.450
financing.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.170
Think, for example, that they may

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.110
resort to selling fixed assets

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.390
to obtain the liquidity needed to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.790
continue operating or request additional

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.310
debt, thus compromising their

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.250
risk situation.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.670
The second is the investment

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.930
activity.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.410
In addition to the purely business

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.210
operations, or the vast majority

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.650
need to invest in

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.430
fixed assets or non-current

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.670
assets.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.370
So imagine, if you are a factory,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.370
you need to make investments

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.470
in machinery or if you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.670
are a cook.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.230
There are many people who

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.810
may confuse or include this investment

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.610
activity within the transactions,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.070
but they are really different

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.470
activities that should

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.870
be analyzed differently.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.930
In fact, there may be companies

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.830
whose operations are running

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.010
well, but that have made decisions

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430
to make excessive investments

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.090
in fixed assets and that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.070
end up slashing the company's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.050
performance.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.850
Finally, we have the perspective

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.770
of financing.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.690
Activities related to how the company

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.130
has obtained the funds necessary

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.470
for its activity, either

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.650
through loans or debt from outside

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.270
funds in which we would include

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.450
the entry of loans, the bite

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.710
of loans, etc., or the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.690
relationship with the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.630
partners in which we will

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.350
include the entry or contributions

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.450
of capital both initial

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.170
and subsequent and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.070
the payment of dividends.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.770
We'll look at several cases, several

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.790
circumstances of different

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.610
companies that will help us understand

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.190
how to do this analysis from

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.730
a perspective, from a triple

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.930
perspective.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.370
In this case, we have a restaurant.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.350
The operations are working well and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.390
the investment decisions have been

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.230
appropriate.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.030
The problem is that at the time of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.790
the establishment of the restaurant

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.250
it was decided to resort to an excessive

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.930
debt percentage.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.390
The partners did not have enough capital

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.750
and were either leveraged or

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.910
indebted too much.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.030
Therefore, they are compromising monthly

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.990
cash flow because every month you

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.030
have to amortise part of that debt

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.710
and they are generating liquidity

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.310
problems.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.890
Let us look at another case.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.390
In this case, we have a profitable

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.090
company that has been created

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.210
recently and has the possibility

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.770
of growing very ambitiously

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.410
in international

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.750
markets or by means of a percentage.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.850
If we analyze the company from the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.110
perspective of the investment it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.710
will have to make strong investments

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.370
in fixed assets and we will

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.790
have to resort to more financing,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.670
to greater debt or capital

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.750
expansions to be able to finance

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.310
all that investment.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.090
In this case, operations are

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.070
also very profitable.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.910
The company is working very well

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.350
and has generated a lot of cash

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.730
for a period of time.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.310
What can you do with that box?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.490
If we analyze the financial perspective,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.110
what we see is that what has been

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.190
taken advantage of is to amortise

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.250
a loan in an accelerated manner

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.430
with the aim of reducing

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.290
its leverage and risk.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.170
Now we'll look at two companies

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.430
that in this case have a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.330
problem with operations.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.450
The operations are not being

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.390
profitable, there is no generating

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.690
treasury and they are

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.470
having real problems paying

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.490
suppliers, paying nomads,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.770
paying debts and more.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.070


00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.910
If we analyze the company from the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.310
perspective of investment, what

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.430
we see is that what it is doing

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.970
is selling fixed assets to be

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.830
able to sell that payment to suppliers.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.010
Therefore, it is making a necessary

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.730
decision in the short term but

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.690
it may not be sustainable

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.110
in the long term.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.210
Another option would be if, for

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.770
example, you do not have assets

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.370
to sell, it would be to resort

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.970
to additional financing that

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.150
is not always possible but imagine

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.530
that you give us an additional

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.530
loan because we have to

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.350
pay the salaries and we resort

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.450
to baccarat financing.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.650
Well it is true that we can

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.010
solve the problem in the short term

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.530
but like putting the situation of

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.570
the company in the medium term

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.410
in this case because the indebtedness

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.930
is being excessive.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.230
I hope you already have clear

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.090
what the three main

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.050
activities of a company

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.590
are and why having this

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.770
perspective will help

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.250
us to do a much deeper analysis

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.850
of any company.
