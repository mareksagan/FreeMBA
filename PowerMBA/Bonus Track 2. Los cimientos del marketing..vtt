00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.100
Let's briefly see what the specific

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.180
areas of knowledge are,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.380
what you'll learn in this marketing

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.320
course the fundamentals

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.700
to keep in mind, before you

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.320
get into the mud a little

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.700
bit.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.760
As I have said, understanding customers

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.120
is fundamental, we will learn to

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.360
segment, that segmentation

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.480
sounds like a typical concept boring

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.800
and familiar, but I assure you

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.380
that it is transformative, in what

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.600
it consists is that you will

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.240
learn to analyze your market from

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.500
many different perspectives

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.760
that make you see things

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.600
clearer.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.000
We will learn to create customer

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.860
people, which is to convert those

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.240
segments, after all you can't analyze

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.420
or describe them, you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.560
can measure them, but when you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.420
think of people it's much easier

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.860
that you learn to understand

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.900
your customers well.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.180
We will work a lot on this, because

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.820
you have to be very good understanding

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.940
your customers already, but from

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.460
what perspectives you have to analyze

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.680
them, what is what you have to know

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.860
about your customers, what you have

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.100
to know the age and sex, you don't

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.480
have to know thousands of things more,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.980
you have to know why they buy you,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.080
why they don't buy you, what

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.280
they think of you, what they

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.080
think of the competition, how is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.500
their decision process, etc.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.720
Imagine when you know all this, it is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.280
that it is gold, it is that then everything

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.940
is very easy.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.920
We will learn a series of strategies

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.080
or tools of targeting, which

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.120
is basically, you have to decide

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.720
which customer person or which

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.140
customer segments to address

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.000
and people do it a little by intuition,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.840
but it is that when you know

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.400
the techniques you realize that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.540
there are many more opportunities.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.380


00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.300
We will learn to quantify the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.700
size of the market, mainly from

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.360
two perspectives, because

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.960
we should never forget this,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.320
it is large enough to make

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.960
the decision to which

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.940
segments to aim.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.500
You have to learn a series of

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.820
tools, concepts and models that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.080
help you create winning, differentiated,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.820
more powerful value proposals,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.920
etc.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.280
As we said, this is important,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260
the most powerful thing is that

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.520
you are able to create things

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.780
that people want to buy.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.480
To do this, we will look at a model

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.260
that we have created that helps

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.180
you understand well what a value proposition

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.000
is and what are the components

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.180
of a value proposition or

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.020
what are the ingredients

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.480
of a value proposition.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.200
If I now ask you to analyze the value

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.140
proposal of BlaBlaCar, for

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.260
example, that we will analyze it,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.380
because I am sure that what you tell

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.460
me is a mess and when you have a mess

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.840
in your head it is very difficult

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.740
to innovate on that, it is very difficult

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.680
to improve.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.380
That's what we want you to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.940
see very clearly.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.620
In addition to the model, what we'

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.840
re going to do is share a series

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.920
of tips that help you create

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.520
more powerful value proposals and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.060
basically are two.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.720
One of them is that you have

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.960
to try to appeal or generate

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.300
benefits that are truly important

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.620
to people, we'll see what

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.300
I mean.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.340
And another is that you have to,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.800
as far as possible, try to create

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420
proposals that reduce costs,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360
not only economic, but the efforts

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.520
associated with your proposal

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.840
with respect to your

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.640
competitors, that is,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.020
increase convenience.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.880
Let us look at a case that illustrates

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.600
its perfection.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.300
And this is potentially great, when

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.420
you get it, what you do is have

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.540
more powerful proposals than your

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020
competitors and basically you crush them.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.300
Another of the techniques,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.920
knowledge, strategies that will help

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.860
you in this great challenge of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.260
being good creating very powerful

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.860
value proposals is to know the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.900
blue ocean strategy.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780
Basically, everyone, all companies

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.220
in any sector, in any sector

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.040
are absolute fools,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.440
are all doing the same.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.420
And you will know a series of very

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.840
practical tools, such as the value

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.540
curve, such as the RICE matrix, such

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.040
as the innovation in value, which helps

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.620
you, not forcing you almost, is to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.760
think otherwise with the aim of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.800
getting out of that flock, which

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.640
we do not call the flock, we call

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.340
the red ocean in which they are

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.300
all there fighting, doing the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.880
same and looking for your blue

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.440
ocean.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.440
Not only will we look

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.400
at the tools, but we will look at

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.660
cases that will inspire you that

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.260
this is relatively easy to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.640
do, especially when you have

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.400
the knowledge.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.020
The Power MBA is a clear case of blue

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.820
ocean, HouseFight, Global Password,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.240
Miluna Rooms, I think you will

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.380
love it, because as I say, they will

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.660
illustrate how others have done it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.920
and you will begin to understand

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.280
much better the disruption generated

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.560
by other companies.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.140
You also have to learn

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.940
to turn ideas, projects into

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.660
reality.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.160
We are speaking especially of ideas

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.200
or projects that are innovative

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.340
in which there is a lot

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.040
of risk.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.160
Traditionally, to what we have learned,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.900
because it has always been so,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.220
historically the markets

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.760
because they had little

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.080
certainty, evolved little, etc.,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.440
we have learned to compete, we

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.640
have learned to be better than

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.240
others in environments, well,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.200
competitive.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.560
But when you are talking about

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.920
innovating or creating things

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.040
that don't exist, where the risk

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.440
is much greater, the knowledge

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.240
you have to have is radically

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.320
different.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.000
And if you apply what we've learned

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.600
all your life, you apply it in environments

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.060
of high uncertainty and risk because

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.340
you're creating things that you

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.120
don't know if they're going

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.240
to want to buy you, how

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.300
the market will react, etc.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.380
If you do, you will die a hundred percent.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.180
It is always so.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.660
We must learn or want

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.600
to learn.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.860
This is the Lean Start methodology.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.620


00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.760
And you'll also learn something

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.620
you'll love, which is a

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.560
competition we've called Power

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.320
Selling.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.780
Basically, what you will

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.500
learn is to sell super attractively

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.380
your proposal, your products,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.380
your services.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.380
And this, when you have a

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.520
proposal that people want to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.960
buy, if not, obviously not.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.700
But we are starting out with that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.740
yes, that you are in a market where

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.880
people are buying you.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.240
When you apply this, when you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.460
apply this knowledge, you sell

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.340
a lot more.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.200
When you apply this knowledge and,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.420
for example, invest here and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.780
there, it is that everything will

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.100
work a thousand times better.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.720
What will we learn?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.480
Well, let's look at the laws of

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.220
persuasion that are a series of laws

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.820
described by Robert Cialdini,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.920
who is the greatest guru in this,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.200
which helps us understand a number

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.520
of things that we can apply to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.140
marketing.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.640
We'll see a decalogue that we'

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.260
ve created so that everything

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.320
you sell you do irresistibly.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.580
Everything we sell is

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.340
all about.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.600
Every time you write an email,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.340
every time you post an ad,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.560
your website, etc.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.780
And if you apply the decalogue, what

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.320
you'll get is that it's resilient.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.900
One of the key tips, which in addition

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.960
there are a number of techniques

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900
you will learn too, is to generate

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.120
intrigue, generate curiosity,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.900
generate surprise.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.840
Usually, when you jump ads on display

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.520
or social networks, or whatever,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.840
they are all, they are boring,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.220
they tell you nothing, they

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.340
leave you indifferent.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.420
You have to learn to create

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.820
a lot of surprises.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.680
We will almost be inspired by magazines

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680
like El Cuore, for example,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.280
where everything generates a lot

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.080
of curiosity.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.220
There are a number of techniques you

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.580
will learn.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.060
We will learn to apply the decalogue

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.020
and all this series of techniques.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.420
And we'll see it with examples,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.760
some of our own, to create ads

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.680
on Facebook, to create lead magnets,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.180
that we'll see what it is, if

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.240
you don't know it, to create

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.480
ads on Google and more.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.080
And what you'll learn is to create

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.100
a structure with all the messages

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.200
you want to communicate.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.020
And this is something that

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.260
helps a lot, because you are sure

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.760
you want to communicate a lot of things

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.160
and start with a blank sheet, right?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.380
I am talking about your website,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.040
for example.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.840
So we'll learn what messages

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.320
you have to incorporate and how to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.700
structure them so that it's super

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.880
easy to follow, so that you don't

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.420
require mental strength, so that

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.600
it's super entertaining, etc.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.860
And in particular, we will apply

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.200
a framework, a model, that helps

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.040
us create this script of all your

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.620
communications and that is as attractive

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.260
as if it were, because that,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.800
a story, a novel or a movie.
