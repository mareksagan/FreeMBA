WEBVTT

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.910
I would like you to tell us, that you

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.650
will talk to us about the main clauses

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.670
or the usual clauses that

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.850
are incorporated into the partners'

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.290
agreements because there are words

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.470
that come up a lot, dragalot,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.030
well, there are many concepts

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.050
that we hear but that I think

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.090
we don't understand well.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.710
Well, because I put you to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.190
a few very concrete examples that

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.590
are the most common clauses of this

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.650
type of documents, there are countless.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.810
I think there are countless.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.710
And at the end of all is very

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.010
important, it is fun because many

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.890
times people come who say, give me

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.130
an example of partners' pact,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.870
give me a draft if it doesn't work

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.510
like that, the important thing is

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.870
that people open things and then regulate

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.090
it, but in any case, that is, clauses

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.570
say archetypical of a partners'

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.250
pact, on the one hand is the,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.330
you've already mentioned the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.930
dragalot, the drag that is a bit

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.290
the clause by antonomasia and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.570
why is it so important?

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.150
Because it is the clause that

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.250
gives you liquidity, that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.010
is, it is a clause that allows you

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.770
that if we agree a few, we can

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.090
force all others to sell their shares,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.050
because this somehow is generated

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.730
to allow you to take advantage

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.390
of the opportunity to sell

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.970
the company and get liquidity for

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.950
your investment, because if

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.370
you do not get with, that is,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.370
you can not force a person to come

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.470
their shares in principle if you

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.670
do not have a good regulation,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.050
that is, I have a 0.2% of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.690
my company and they will have

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.590
to take away from my dead

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.330
fingers so that I sell it, okay?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.610
However, if I have a dragalot

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950
in which he says, hear, if we

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.510
agree with 60% and find

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.110
a buyer who puts us so many

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.230
millions of euros on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.810
the table, you sell.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.730
In the dragalot, the lower limit

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.430
of the valuation is usually set.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.490
This is a very important thing and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.470
I always recommend it.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.970
There are as many dragon claustro

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.390
regulations as everyone wants, much

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.050
will depend on whether you are

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.550
a minority or a majority.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.010
If you are a minority,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.350
you will want to establish

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690
a very specific regime

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.470
that allows us to sell

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.390
at any price.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.210
If you are a majority and you don't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.790
care, you have an 80%, you will say,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.910
hear, look, if I get in your compiler,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.210
here we sell, we all forget.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.230
It doesn't matter the price.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.510
It is, in other words, that according

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.350
to who establishes it or who is the driver,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.490
it has been fixed.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.530
Exactly, in one way or another.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.590
That is very important, that is, there

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.930
are no standard clauses that

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.550
cover for each case.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.150
A dragon can be the best or worst

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.130
thing that happens to you in your company's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.770
history.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.230
It will depend, above all, on your

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.410
interests, your percentage and what

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.170
you want to regulate.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.190
That's why it's so important that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.450
you do it with someone who really

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.670
understands the effect that it generates

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.710
in the long run, not in the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.570
short term, that anyone can see.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.910
If someone comes and buys

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.990
me, then...

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.070
Well, but well, the dragon is basically

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.030
an agreement for which there is a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.170
majority, well, I don't know, I don't

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.390
know if it has to be a majority.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.030
It depends.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.210
It really depends.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.130
If you have a purchase offer,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.010
you are obliged to sell

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.350
it, right?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.230
Of course, what is going on?

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.150
For example, imagine a uncle who

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.350
has a 0.5% company, has two

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.910
shares of the company.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.570
Suddenly a buyer comes and says,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.850
you hear, I buy you the company

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.750
for a million euros, 10 million

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.230
euros, or 100 million euros.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.650


00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.990
He says, then look, you have touched, I don't

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.130
know, the invention, 500,000 euros.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.850
He said, “I don't want a million.”

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.370


00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.650
No, because you are touching 500,000.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.090
Either I sell it for a million dollars or I don't sell it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.290
If I do not sell...

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.130
I would block the operation.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.270
Of course, don't sell 100% of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.970
the company you want.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.270
That's exactly what the buyer wants.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.170
This makes many operations

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.770
difficult.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.610
Drag, it is phenomenal understood

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.830
with the concept drag, well.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.610
Then there is the dragon, dragon,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.830
dragon, the accompaniment, say,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.390
a little like the reverse of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.850
the coin.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.690
The big deal that somehow

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.950
facilitates is that minority investors

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.890
who have a small percentage

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.070
within the company, do not

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.530
stay alone in capital when

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.530
the majority or many of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.730
the founders sell the capital.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.590
I mean, someone comes and says, I don't

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.770
want to be 100%.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.390
I have 80% of the money

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.590
and I do what I want.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.630
Of course, then the majority

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.090
say, take my 80% and here it stays.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.110
And those 50 guys who have a 0.2%.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.590
At the end they don't see a hard one,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.470
they're stuck in a project that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.670
doesn't interest them any more, etc.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.610
Especially because at some point

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.810
an investor will enter the team.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.470
They will say, I think these

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.130
guys will be able to build this

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.970
business and generate this profit.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.490
If these guys suddenly get rid

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.390
of them, they get their yield and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.310
you get left, after putting much

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.590
more money for a very high valuation,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.090
unable to settle, without being

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.390
able to make your investment

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.850
liquid...

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.910
And the team has already changed,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.590
because the founding team

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.130
has gone out selling their

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.410
shares, investors or buyers

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.190
have put their manager team, etc.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.310
The minority partners are

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.670
in a position, which was not

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.370
the desired one.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.570
That's a part and then you

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.750
think that many companies

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.810
buy or sell to settle them,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.350
to take a competitor out

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.050
of the market.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.550
Imagine that you have invested

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.950
x100,000 euros in a company,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.710
you get a 1%, the founders

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.330
ask and buy you to dissolve you.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.230
Ostrava, the position is very...

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.870
The tagalone...

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.090
Yes, what allows you, if when

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.390
a buyer comes and buys, for

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.910
example, let us put an example,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.870
because in case the founders

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.730
sell more than 10%, a 15% of

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.710
their shares, I can force them

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.090
to buy my percentage too.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.870
A percentage, or a proportion,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.990
or a 100%.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.070
Many times what is said is if you

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.850
sell more than 50% or of the stock

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.050
of the founders, you sell 100% of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.430
the investors.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.130
Well well, very good.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.490
and Genius.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.890
This is an example of a tagalone.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.130
Then there is a clause that is

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.470
increasingly heard of it, which

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.790
is preferential settlement.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.430
For years, they were used

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.410
in venture capital operations.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.750
And now, in the more advanced rounds.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.750
Now there are people who

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.970
are trying to get into even in very

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.670
early rounds.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.650
In the end, the preferential

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.590
settlement is what it tries to keep

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.150
the value before the...

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.730
We already talked about the value

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.230
that the company has that it

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.670
is important that your company

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.970
rating is not too high so that

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.350
you can then launch the next rounds.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.630
Keep that value over

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.090
time.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.870
That is, hear, look, if tomorrow

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.530
we sell the company, you told me

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.730
that this company was worth

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.570
when I entered a million euros

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.210
and we sell it for less, I take

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.050
my part, I take what I have

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.390
invested and the rest you share

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.230
it between you.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.010
In the end, I have a higher

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.590
percentage of the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.330
capital.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.410
If I had capted and turned a 5% and

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.690
I would touch 5,000 euros and I

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.330
put 100,000, I recover my 100,000

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.690
euros and the rest you divide

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.590
it as you want.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.750
It is a preferred settlement.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.070
This is a key issue that

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.310
benefits investors a lot.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.990
We have also seen it much less

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.090
commonly put by entrepreneurs

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.330
in some special situations

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.290
when there has been a special

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.130
performance or they have

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.810
made initial contributions.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.790
But in general, it is often investors

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.690
who put them in to give a way

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.790
to ensure that at least the contribution

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.850
they have made the company

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.950
recovers.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.090
I won't get 10 or

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.590
20 or 5 or 3.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.330
But not palm.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.990
Not a palm.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.430
An investor enters a company in a

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.090
round where it is valued at $10 million,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.230
for example, and imposes,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.390
if there is a preferential settlement

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.470
clause as you have called it,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.470
regardless of whether

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.350
it ends up selling for 7, they

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.850
would recover their

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.970
money in the proportion

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.830
of what we put in.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.530
If for one, two or three

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.230
percent they would be 100,000, the

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.030
first 100,000 would be the million

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.550
they contributed.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.830
That is a bit of the mechanism.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.550
Or there is a clause that looks

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.110
like a very funny name called pay

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.730
to play.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.250
Pay to play.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.930
Yes, that is, how you play to participate.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.270
You are paid to participate.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.210
So, this clause what allows you

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.650
is to say look, you in this round

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.170
have this settlement preference.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.150
If you don't continue to add in

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.490
the next round, you lose it.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.310
Because you stopped investing, you

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.230
stopped betting on the company.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.210
So if you want to keep these

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.490
rights, you have to keep putting

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.010
money.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.430
This clause is like two countermeasures

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.670
or two ways of negotiating

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.870
against preferential settlement.
