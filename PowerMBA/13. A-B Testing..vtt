WEBVTT

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.830
Thank you very much, Uncle, a pleasure.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.610
Would be missing more.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.790
How well we are here.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.290
The environment helps a lot.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.750
What a wonderful.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.210
We will talk about a key concept

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.870
in digital marketing and e-commerce,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.990
which is the A.B.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.670
It is used in many

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.070
areas and has huge

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.170
benefits.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.830
So I would like you to start

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.970
by explaining what it is.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.230
Well, first of all, as long as

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.890
on the ground, we are talking about

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.230
online land, e-commerce, digital

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.190
marketing, but this also happens

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.670
in the offline world, in

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.830
any more traditional business

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.470
model, as long as we detect something

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.630
that is not working well, for

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.150
example, on a certain web we are

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.350
having high leads, we see that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.790
the purchase processes are not

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.710
completing or already entering

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.810
more in the field of digital

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.950
marketing, we detect our emailing

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.550
campaigns are not working well,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.890
we do not have a relevant opening

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.850
rate, they do not answer

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.570
us, we do not generate

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.890
leads, we do campaigns

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.610
on Facebook, the same, we

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.670
are not receiving traffic.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.230
Whenever we have to understand

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.290
why things are not working, the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.110
following disjunctive is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.090
presented to us.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.390
Try to look for alternatives so that

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.830
they work better and then,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.870
obviously, which of them we stay with.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.030
So then A.B.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.210
The test is the tool or the one

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.350
I'm discussing right now.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.290
Another very clear example, imagine,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.370
we are in an e-commerce and we have

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.090
a button to add this product to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.310
the cart, do you think that issues

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.030
such, say, specifics as,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.830
for example, that the button is orange

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.010
or that the button is black,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.990
that it has or does not have a relief,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.750
that it is on the left of the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.870
screen or on the right, up or

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.050
down, do you think that can

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.310
affect how much a product

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.590
is added to a cart or not?

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.930
It really affects and affects a

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.370
lot, right?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.650
To find out which is the best

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.330
alternative, you can also use techniques

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.070
such as A.B.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.350
and testing.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.490
What is AB?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.790
The Testing?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.430
It consists of the following,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.190
from our customer base entering

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.630
our funnel, whether e-commerce

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.170
or digital marketing, what

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.070
we have to do is divide our

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.170
customer base into

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.330
two or more groups.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.370
The name is A.B.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.850
Testing comes by dividing

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.610
into two groups.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.510
They must be heterogeneous,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.490
that is, that represent our

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.050
population, they must be

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.570
statistically significant.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.710
What do I mean by this?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.770
It is not worthwhile that in groups,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.070
you target, for example, in one

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.650
group all millennials and in the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.470
other group all people over

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.350
50 with some income X, because

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.750
the conclusions you can draw

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.490
from there are false.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350
This is what is called comparing

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.030
pears with apples.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.650
The same, then you have to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.970
compare apples to apples,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.930
apples population, heterogeneous

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.150
and statistically significant.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.830
Once we have those groups, what

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.870
we would do would be the following,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.550
as soon as we have detected what

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.010
problem we have and what different

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.290
alternatives we want to test to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.850
see which works best, one group

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.590
we teach one, another group

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.590
we teach another and we put

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.610
them to compete in time.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.690
So that we then apply analytics,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.630
measure what return we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.970
are getting with each

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.410
of these options and,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.430
obviously, let Darwin

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.250
act.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.970
We stay with the option that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150
is best adapted to the options

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.610
that the return group has provided.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.910
What can be improved with Ibitesting?

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.890
What types of goals can we measure

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.990
with Ibitesting?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.230
First of all, sales.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.970
If we want to improve our buying

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.850
process in an e-commerce, for example,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.630
and we want to measure whether

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.950
it is better to put the add button

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.570
to the cart in this way or this

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.210
other, if it is better to put

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.450
the detail page in this way or

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.610
this other, if it sells more

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.230
this type of image or this other

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.170
type of image, all this type

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.250
of issues, obviously

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.870
we can apply the Ibitesting.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.070
We want to maximize traffic

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.430
through Facebook campaigns.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.550
For example, Facebook allows us

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.990
to do Ibitesting also with

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.290
different images, different

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.910
texts, also to measure which

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.570
works best.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.930
Imagine that what we want to

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.490
maximize is records.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.950
We are a Netflix, for example,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.870
and we want to get people who

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.010
get to our website to register

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.170
for our service and use

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.050
it, right?

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.050
Well, because not everyone has

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.210
to see the same button, not

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.210
everyone has to see the same

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.070
message.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.010
Some will probably see a free

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.390
Netflix trial from the first

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.530
day, others will enjoy

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.890
our unique content offer.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.390
In the background, some will see a series,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.870
others will see another, others will

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.290
see only one, a background let'

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.770
s say more minimalist.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.590
All this can be tested so that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.950
you look for the way to better

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.570
your ultimate goal, which

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.610
are records.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.130
As you can see, Ibitesting can

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.270
be applied to a multitude of

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.370
different issues, but what is behind

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.070
all this, which is the concept,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.690
which is to divide our users into

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.850
heterogeneous groups, to

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.690
test different alternatives

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.290
and analytically stay with

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.190
the one that works best,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.730
that is common to all the goals

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.830
that we may want to measure

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.370
at any time.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.690
I will summarize what you

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.010
said.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.610
What everyone has to keep in mind,

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.510
that you said very well, is that

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.110
I think you have helped us understand

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.610
it, is that the possibilities

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.090
of optimization are

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.150
endless.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.090
Have you ever finished doing Ibid?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.010
Thro the whole funnel and within

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.650
absolutely anything you want to

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.790
improve, the possibilities

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.030
in themselves, the alternatives

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.050
you have are, for as you said,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.430
change the colors, change

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.570
the order of the words, change

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.410
the messages, is infinite.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.350
Then the process we have

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.670
to do is first identify, as

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.090
you said, what we want

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.230
to optimize or what we want

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.810
to improve.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.230
The records, the average ticket, the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.610
conversion at a certain point,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.830
first identify that.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.230
Two, let's think about

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.350
alternatives, let's make hypotheses,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.650
because of course, as you told

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.570
me, they are infinite, well,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.990
we have to focus on some.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.430
I'll see if the red button works

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.790
better or the green button.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.570
Of course, you can put the button

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.430
in a billion colors, but we'll identify.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.230
We have two possibilities.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.210
And we use Ibitesting, which is

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.810
the key tool or key methodology

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.110
to measure whether red

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.430
or green works best.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.070
And we do so with groups of

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.970
customers that have to be

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.550
heterogeneous and also

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.830
sufficiently representative.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.290
If we come up with three, we

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.070
make the wrong conclusions.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.910
It is worse than not to draw conclusions.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.050
That is, the worst thing you can

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.270
do is make wrong conclusions,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.730
so what you're commenting is

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.930
over-important.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.990
