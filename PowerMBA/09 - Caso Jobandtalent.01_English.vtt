00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.100
As you know, platforms are revolutionizing

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.760
the diversity of sectors.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.860
I would say everyone.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.200
And what I want is that you understand

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.040
well what are the benefits or differences

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.400
between a platform type model

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980
and a traditional one.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.340
And today what we will do is to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.420
reinforce that knowledge by

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.140
analyzing a case.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.660
Let’s look at the case of Jovan Talent.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.460
And we will do it again firsthand

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.920
with the testimony of Felix Ruiz,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.180
who is one of the artists of the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.740
success of Before sharing with

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.840
you the conversations we have

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.260
had with Felix, I want to

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.140
give you a series of data

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.260
about Jovan Talent.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.020
I want you to understand the company a little

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.820
bit more.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.700
Jovan Talent is a company that is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
well known for various reasons.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.820
One of them is that it has always

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.400
been very strongly capitalized.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.460
In several rounds of financing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.000
it has raised around 80 million

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.820
euros and has initially had

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.520
many problems.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.480
Despite having a lot of money,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.900
he had a lot of trouble.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.260
He also went on to press because

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.160
they had to dismiss people,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.880
etc.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.440
There have been many problems in this regard.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.560
But it is also true that from

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.940
April 2016 Jovan Talent decides

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.780
to pivot in its business model,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.080
decides to evolve its business model,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.060
leave behind the previous model

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.240
and develop a new model that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.320
has turned out to be an authentic

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.600
success.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.240
As of April 2016, sales

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.080
are rising.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.900
We are talking about that

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.980
currently it is trading around

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.920
6 million a month.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.600
I will leave you with Felix and Rafa.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.080
Felix will start by telling us the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.320
beginnings, the first business model

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.700
of Jovan Talent and then we will

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160
go to analyze it.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.960
Felix, for four years you have

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.740
been dedicated 100% and body and soul

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.380
to the Jovan Talent project.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.360
Tell us what Jovan Talent is and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300
approach a little more or give

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.980
us a little more detail about how

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.580
the Jovan Talent business model is.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.860
Well, Jovan Talent is a platform

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.080
that is obviously oriented

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.140
to the employment sector.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.420
Initially, Jovan Talent’s

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.480
idea was to be a recruitment platform,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.920
a tool that companies would

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100
use to hire staff or to search

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.320
for candidates, but adapted to the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.140
new world, the world

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.840
of mobile.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140
Until now everything was desktop, everything

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.680
was web pages through which you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800
could search for candidates, but

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.400
since a few years here because obviously

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.300
the mobile has evolved

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.360
a lot and we wanted to transfer

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.740
that to a mobile application.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.520
From there we realized that the market

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.820
was a pretty solid market already

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.680
with the products there and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.800
it was very difficult to penetrate

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.220
and compete against the already existing

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.380
classified that at the time because

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.280
in Spain were info jobs, in the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.860
United States was Monster and were

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.720
already very, very, very established

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.480
in the markets.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.460
Then good, because despite that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.140
we struggled a lot and we tried,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.480
we tried to consolidate that same

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.920
model adapted to the mobile,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.660
but it was very complicated.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.720
We don’t need to go into

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.300
details of why things didn’t

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.820
work, but Felix gives us

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.280
some clue.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.520
They tried to compete with

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.120
digital platforms like Monster or

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.900
as info jobs that already added the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.980
supply and demand through a platform,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.060
but the model Jovan Talen proved

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.200
not to be successful and as they

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.940
say, rectificars of wise

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.520
men and from April 2016 they

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.860
decided to pivot or evolve

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.640
their business model and Felix

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.520
will tell us.
