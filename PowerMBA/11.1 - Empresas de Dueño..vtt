00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.100
Charly, what I'm going to do now

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.360
it is from the photo that we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.720
we have made your model of

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.720
business, which I believe we have

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.860
all very clear, we are going to make a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.200
analysis with the idea of trying to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.180
to draw a conclusion that will help you

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.200
to allow the model to evolve,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.660
but first what I want to do to you

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.200
is a simple question and it is, you

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.060
you have built a business around

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.880
your passion, you are very young and you have

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.700
a company from which you can

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.400
live, but what are your goals?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.540
what do you want?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.830
Let's see, my objectives, as I believe

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.470
any company, especially a startup or

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.090
start-up company is

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.030
success, is to make your

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.710
company to evolve, to grow.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.350
Okay, grow up, sounds good to me.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.830
Well, I'm going to start with my

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.370
analysis and the first thing I'm going to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.690
is the first thing I'm going to tell you

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.190
transmitting is that what you

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.310
it happens, that you have not made him see

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.350
before, that you are not working on

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.230
social networks, don't be

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.170
working on the uptake of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.750
customers, well, that sort of thing

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.450
is because you are in the operation

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.490
day-to-day business and the operation of the

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.270
day to day makes you, the urgent makes you, the urgent makes you, the urgent makes you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.630
makes, let's say, to be forgetting

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.410
importantly, there is a matrix that

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.090
is urgent and important, well,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.310
well, I believe that happens and as

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.330
it is sometimes said, as it is bad for

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.370
many a fool's comfort, well,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.610
but I think that what you have to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.490
is to rethink things,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.630
to try to gain a little bit of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.910
height and define objectives

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.890
strategic beyond what is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.570
you have to do today, and it's a little

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.830
what we are going to do, what we

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.470
you have to do today that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.650
will probably be to edit the videos

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.830
of a customer or something like that, but that

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.830
every so often you have to stop, I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.970
I have experienced it because I am a consultant

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.150
years, it is necessary to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.690
stop and rethink where we are headed.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.710
you want to go and what you have

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.390
to do, we start with the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.310
analysis of the business model, the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.890
first, I will analyze the offer

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.970
of products and services and what

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.010
I tell you is that your offer, your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.210
proposal is exactly the same

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.150
than the rest of the companies, no

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.530
nothing happens, what happens is that

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.550
when you offer the same as the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.510
other, a true commodity, you will

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.710
you play in this type of business,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.610
you play to grow or not to grow in

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.250
your networking, your

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.910
contacts, that's the point and that's why

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.950
we have put it in the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.750
distribution, you play it there, yes

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.290
you have more contacts with people,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.890
with companies that, well, you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.050
will go better, but that's the key

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.410
of success now, if you offer the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.990
same as the others will be that, I think

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.930
which is a weakness of the model and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.110
then there is another very

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.550
important and it's something I'm going to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.530
and I'm sure there's a lot to explain and I'm sure there's a lot

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.870
people who identify with and identify with

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.790
is that what he was telling me is that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.030
the key resources are the material

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.150
and people, the material nothing

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.050
same because it costs about

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.230
how many thousands of euros but already

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.150
is, the key resource in your

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
business is something physical that is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.110
you can buy and that's it, the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.370
key resource in your business you are

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.890
you, are the people, you and your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.410
and that is a great scourge in the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.730
a business model, why?

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.430
because that makes your company

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.550
will never be worth money, because if

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.670
you could not sell your company

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.690
never, because if you sell your company

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.850
and it comes out, your company doesn't have a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.150
strong customer portfolio and if

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.450
it would not matter because the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.730
would lose, because the people what they

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.190
trust is in you, not in overs,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.450
then this is what is called

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.230
self-employment and it happens to firms

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.450
of lawyers, it happens to small and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.450
consulting firms, it happens to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.650
physiotherapies, it happens to everyone.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.790
world that sells its service

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.870
and you'll tell me well, you'll tell me

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.770
that this is how this business works,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.030
Well, what I'm telling you is

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.450
that works like this but it is a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.910
weakness of the model, because it is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.070
very sacrificial, because you're going to

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.210
to have to be permanently

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.630
your whole life attracting customers

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.190
like us and if one day you want to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.010
leave it or sell it or whatever it is not

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.830
will be worth nothing, you will have won

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.290
money everything, yes of course, but of course in the face

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.890
to success, both for the company and for its

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.250
what you can in the future, is

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.170
truth that I may not be able to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.170
sell it or then I can't get

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.290
performance of it, but it is

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.550
truth that also contributes to me

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.030
not only financially but also

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.050
we also give I know that it is what

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.490
you like to do, what I'm saying is that

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.130
is so, that is, you could also

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.790
do something other than self-employment

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.570
or at least seek it, pursue

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.890
that, when the key resources of

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.350
a company, this already as a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.490
when resources are scarce, and when the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.910
the key to a company's success, the main

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.390
are the people, not only the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.270
but the partners, there is a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.910
a huge problem because the

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.730
company is worth a lot less money.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.550
Based on these conclusions, the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.670
we are going to do is try to

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.810
identify any ideas for

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.070
evolve your business model,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.250
perhaps make a company more

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.190
scalable, larger, more

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.930
value, I know that you have a

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.210
idea that you are not going to tell us

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.130
today, perhaps not throughout The

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.110
Power, because he doesn't want to tell

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.110
because he is afraid that he will be

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.370
copy, along The Power

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.390
MVA I hope that someday we will

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.750
but what I'm going to do

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.410
is me simply giving some idea

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.030
I hope that someday it will be brought to

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430
and is successful.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.750
Indeed, I am convinced that

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.290
yes you have all our help here,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.650
what I'm going to do is simply

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.730
to some idea that you don't have.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.950
I have given it a lot of thought, but in order to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.870
to serve as an example of how to think.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.950
First, I propose an innovation

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.050
that part of the segments of

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.150
customers, i.e. looking for new customers

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.010
customer segments and tell you what

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.290
next Charlie, I think in the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.410
world of institutions

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.630
There is an enormous

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.710
opportunity, why?

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.010
because content is growing

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.870
self-visual within the schools

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.350
business, we are

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.410
living, I think it could be

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.470
simply put, it does not make

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.710
If we don't value it today, it could

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.070
be a business opportunity in the

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.610
the fact that you addressed

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.750
business schools and

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.110
digitize your entire program,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.430
that you were for a year with

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.710
equipment in the classrooms and

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.130
within a year they would have a

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.290
program that they could sell from

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.110
digital form, I think it can be,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.250
then you would have the following advantages

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.470
recurring revenues during

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.630
one year with an institution, which

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.250
could be an annual fi, even

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.670
you could help them more, you could

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.010
diversify and even help them to

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.630
not only in the recording of the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.950
content but then in the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.170
platform, you could set up a

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.470
strategic alliance with a partner

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.170
technology and ultimately get paid,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.890
well, just imagine, for creating a

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.870
YouTube channel or by creating

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.410
all the content, it is something

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.110
similar to what you are doing

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.810
with us but I tell you a lot

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.150
let's say of greater integration, you know?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.510
If, in addition to saying this, I am

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.750
happens because three or four years ago

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.550
days I saw on YouTube Hans Zimmer, is

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.710
a soundtrack composer

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.830
spectacular and is a channel of

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.350
YouTube, I don't know if it's a channel or a

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.550
brand or a company that what it

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.690
is doing is interviewing

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.350
successful people in the world

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.810
cinematographic, such as

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.710
Hans Zimmer on the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.050
music production and does a little

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.610
what we do or you do at The

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.330
Power NBA, is to catch people who

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.330
have been successful in these areas and

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.850
interview them and give you their

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.090
tricks, they give you that's The Power

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.470
NBA, what I am telling you is not that,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.570
is not that you enter into creation

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.150
of the content but that you edit

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.610
the content, i.e. the content

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.250
belonging to a school of

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.970
business, to an institution

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.050
educational, what I propose is

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.450
that you help them to digitize

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.890
these classes that they are giving to

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.410
into videos that can be converted into

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.030
sell it in some form or form, or

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.010
to give it as a reinforcement to their

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.450
I am not telling you that

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.490
to set up a company for the creation of

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.690
content, the content is

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.430
others, what you do is the

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.590
audiovisual, it's just an idea

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.070
Charlie, I'm going to propose another one

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.110
possible evolution and I do it to

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.210
from a conclusion that we have

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.890
obtained before that is that it is not

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.650
we want it to be absolutely

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.050
necessary personal resources

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.810
you in this case to provide the

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.950
service, to attract customers and

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.290
such, then I am inspired by Hoffman,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.010
the Hoffman album, inspires me in

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.450
companies that have succeeded in

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.110
that it is the customer who does the

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.030
part of the supply chain process

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.870
value, usually or that it is the

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.410
technology what it does, in the

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.810
Hoffman's case is technology,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.710
more than the customer does, the

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.150
customer logs in, uploads the photos and

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.170
Hoffman's platform will

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.650
returns an album traditionally

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.230
had to do it by hand crank the

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.950
uncle, the owner of the

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.050
photos, well, but let's go with

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.330
automate part of the process of

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.450
production or outsourcing,

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.290
effectively, or that the

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.390
customer or to be done by the

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.730
technology, that is more scalable

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.970
that you have to do it yourself because

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.790
you can't do any more, we have a

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.170
on-screen photo and

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.290
representative of what is happening

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.830
today and it is that everyone in the

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.190
concerts etc. is

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.770
permanently taking pictures and

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.490
videos and so on and you have

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.970
clients who organize events and

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.310
you can easily have customers

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.030
who organize concerts, because you

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.430
you could create them, you could

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.150
offer them the creation of videos

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.670
spectacular from the

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.950
photos shared by attendees

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.270
to the event or videos, for you

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.130
would be very simple and it would be very

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.230
spectacular and you are also

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.450
innovating in everything because you are

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.350
innovating in the proposal of

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.730
value, you are innovating in the

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.350
costs, you could do it a lot

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.330
cheaper than if you have to

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.050
displace your people, you know, you're

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.750
by transferring the part of the

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.630
recording, that part that we have

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.470
said that of the activities

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.770
keys have recording edition,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.130
you transfer that part to

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.370
customers who number in the thousands

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.270
versions that exist in a

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.490
concert, it seems to me that it is Yes,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.050
is quite well focused because

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.790
I would take and use that material that

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.330
generated by the attendees themselves who

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.830
do not generate any costs for me as

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.630
such and that is a material that

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.810
would even be ceded and for my part

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.250
as much work would be done by the

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.570
editing or editing part for

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.810
give it that professional touch,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.510
but it is true that it is well

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.130
raised because you would use content

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.530
that I do not find it difficult to generate.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.570
Indeed, that was the idea, I

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.010
wanted to reduce key resources

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.070
and wanted to reduce the activities

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.290
and key resources, I reduce the

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.550
person hours and activities

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.270
key I reduce the recording.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.190
Well, Charly, I just want to tell you

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.310
that if this is forward, I want to

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.530
part of the equity of the new

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.670
project and if you become my enaria too.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.890
And me from Power MBA.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.050
Ah, yes.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.070
Well, we just have to talk.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.130
Well, thank you very much,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.170
I hope it has been enriching,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.450
not only for you, but for the entire

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.890
other Power MBA students and me

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.090
would like you to keep us more or less in touch with you.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.090
less informed about how the

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.590
progress, okay?

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.950
Of course, Borja, thank you very much.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.870
To you, of course, a hug.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.530
See you later.
