WEBVTT

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.200
We'll start by defining the concept,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440
which is the one-line, one-line

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.700
pitch, elevator pitch, as

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.060
we want to call it.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.260
It is an affirmation that can

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.460
be composed of one or several

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880
phrases in which you transmit

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.360
in the most direct and brief

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.600
possible way what you do and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.180
allows you to capture interest

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.920
within your target audience.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.520
The one-lineer can be verbalized in a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.120
presencial way, that's not the important

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.360
thing because it should be the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.420
same really.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.200
The one-liner that will

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.140
help us is those situations

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.320
in which someone asks you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.100
what you do?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.180
Have a response that is always

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.240
the same, that is well thought

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.220
out and that is designed

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.240
to the goal.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.420
And what is the goal?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.520
As we have said, the goal is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.040
to generate interest and the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.160
one-lineer we will use

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.120
it to generate interest in

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.260
absolutely all the contact

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320
points we have with customers.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.820
Why is?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.060
Because you have to keep in mind

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.600
that every company has numerous

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.980
points of contact with customers,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.600
that is, it has thousands of opportunities

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.460
to generate interest and to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.180
sell in a multitude of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.740
occasions and we can

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.400
not miss any of them.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.620
You have in mind that a customer

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.040
may have entered a website

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.860
or contacted you through

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.100
linking, connected with you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.700
or received an email.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.600
We don't have to give for granted

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.880
that customers that the target

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.000
audience has visited

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.540
absolutely all the marketing

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.800
pieces we have, so that's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.660
why it's so good to have

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.480
worked the one-lineer and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.240
repeat it to satiety in absolutely

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.220
every opportunity

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.920
we have because it's the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.140
best tool we have to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.160
generate interest in our

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.100
target audience.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.620
We will specify where we

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.240
recommend that you incorporate your

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.940
one-lineer, for example, within

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.620
your website.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.300
Your website has to tell the full

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.080
story, but somewhere on the website

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.280
you should incorporate one-

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.740
line because it is the statement

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.180
that exposes or that transmitts

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.440
in a shorter way what

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.720
you do.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.960
You could add it to your email signature,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.980
there are people who do.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.700
It is very important that you do so on

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.540
your LinkedIn profile.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.080
How many people visit you on LinkedIn?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.980
Well, because people who visit you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.540
on LinkedIn can't miss those opportunities

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020
or on the business cards or there

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.300
are companies that use

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.960
it in the product packaging

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.700
itself.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.820
The goal, as you can see, is

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.460
not to miss any of the opportunities

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.860
or dinner, wherever, when you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.660
meet someone.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.360
You have to work well with the one-lineer.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.840
Another recommendation is that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.640
the entire team should know it.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940
The whole team has to know, it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.880
has to know the story we have

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880
created and the whole team

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.020
has to know the one-lineer.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.020
It's very important because you have

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.760
in mind that your team, all the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.380
people in your team in an organization,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.260
are ultimately a multitude

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.660
of contact points.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.800
They are generating a huge impact on

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.960
your day to day and around.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.620
Repeat it without stopping.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.600
Donald Miller tells us that he

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.880
compares him to a music

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.620
group, a music group that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.780
has a success, that, 20 years

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.400
ago.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.880
What is the song that everyone

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.620
wants to hear when they go to

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.200
a concert?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.400
Probably that group wants to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.840
play the last songs from

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.480
the last album, because they

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.400
are bored to always play the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.940
same.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.820
But really what you have to do

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.220
is play the song that signals

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.340
because it's what the target

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.240
audience expects.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.760
It is the one that gets the most.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.400
The one-line is the same.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.720
You must communicate it by land,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840
sea and air permanently at

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.920
all points of contact you have

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.600
with customers.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.540
Now let's see how to create the one-lineer.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.220
Let's look at a few models or recommendations.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.340
The truth is that this is very useful

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.380
because if you face a blank

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.720
sheet it is very difficult.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.080
You don't even know where to start.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.000
And when we have a model to support

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.080
us, and also some examples, it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.500
is much simpler because you only

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500
have to adapt your messages

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.860
to that structure that is

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.320
already very well thought out

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.620
and very well removed.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.680
On the one hand, what we can

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.360
do is take the story we have

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.020
created with the StoryBrand

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740
framework and make a summary

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.940
and focus primarily on four

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.740
of the sections.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.020
One, that the protagonist feels identified

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.380
in your story in the one-lineer

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.800
that says this is for me.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.540
Two, that we help you visualize

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.980
what the problem is you have.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.760
Let us tell you what our plan is,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.200
although you really won't have

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.440
time to detail it but you'll give

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.680
him some clue about what the plan

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.020
is and you'll tell me I'm

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.520
here to help you with this.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.720
And finally, it's always that we

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.280
help you visualize what the happy

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.020
ending is.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.820
motivation to do so.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.680
Let us now look at three examples and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.520
let us analyze how we have

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.180
considered these different sections.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.180
We start with the case of Viti Sports,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.720
a company you have already known

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.140
that is dedicated to obtaining

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.980
sports scholarships for university students.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.540
Let us see.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.620
The proposal, we help Spanish

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.040
universities to live a dream thanks

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.920
to the management and obtaining

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.400
sports scholarships in American

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.860
universities.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.640
We have managed to identify

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.700
the protagonist because

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.540
we are saying it.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.720
We are talking directly to those

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.880
we help, to Spanish universities.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.700
The problem we have not described expressly

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.820
because at the time we are talking

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.600
about sports scholarships it is already

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.040
obvious that it is to that dream

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.520
you can not access if it is not with

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.560
the scholarship because it is

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.940
economically because that is almost

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.420
unattainable or for very few.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.340
We are telling you how we will help

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.520
you that is that we will help

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.840
you manage and get that scholarship.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.060
And at all times I think it's clear

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.400
what the benefit of living a dream

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.780
and having the opportunity

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.780
to study at an American

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.580
university is.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.340
Let's look at another structure that

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.060
is simpler and that you would only

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.540
have to change the message and

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.120
is explaining to you in a very simple

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.940
way what your plan is or what

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.620
your solution is and three

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.220
describe what the benefit of this

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.280
story is, what the happy end is

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.540
and let's see several examples.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.620
We start with Kuvalu, a marketplace

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620
where you can hire events

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.700
founded by Marta Oderiz,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.520
a student of The Power MBA.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.500
We start.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.580
Organizing an event

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.620
is a real headache.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.980
We have identified the problem.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.500
Our target audience should and here

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.820
I tell you what my solution is.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.480
In Kuvalu you can hire the best

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.320
providers online.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.080
I let you know exactly

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.920
how I solve your problem

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.040
and also describe the happy

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.060
ending because we want not

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.300
only your event to be perfect

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.680
but also to organize

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.480
it easier than ever.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.110
Let us now again take the

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.710
example of Beatisports using this

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.390
structure.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.950
Studying at a university in the

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.730
United States is a dream for many,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.990
but it is within the reach of very few.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.210
This is the problem.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.510
You should feel identified

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.810
with this saying yes because

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.950
I would love it but it is

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.390
true that I can't afford it.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.790
We help you get a sports scholarship.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.130


00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.590
I tell you what my plan is.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.230
So that you have the opportunity to

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.410
live an unforgettable experience that

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.730
is the benefit.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.310
As you can see, it is very easy to

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.310
implement this structure in three simple steps.
