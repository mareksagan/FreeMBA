00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.010
The report of results is the

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.590
financial statement that informs

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.550
us of the net profit and other

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.130
magnitudes of profit such as

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.370
gross margin, EBITDA, gross

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.790
profit, etc., by means of the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.350
difference between expenses and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.750
income that have occurred

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.270
over a period.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.110
In this class we will see how the

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.770
results statement is created and

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.510
we will know the basic structure

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.650
of this financial statement.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.190
I want you to know that profit

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.710
is a flow variable, it is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.310
a variable that tells us what

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.730
has happened over a period of time.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.550
In this case, you see that we put a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.750
barrel, it would be equivalent to

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.290
the water that has come out of the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
barrel for a period of time, unlike

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.950
a variable stock, as we referred

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.950
to in the situation balance,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.270
which would be the water that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.450
is there at a certain time.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.290
Well, let's see how the state of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.810
results is created.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.150
The first thing during this

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.710
period we have done is to record

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.430
the movements in the accounts

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.790
of results, income, expenses,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.630
rent.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.950
Remember that there are accounts

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170
that are results and accounts that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.850
are balance sheet to results.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.530
Obviously we will pass the balances

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.030
of the corresponding

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.270
accounts and we will pass them

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.290
to the state of results that has

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.110
a similar structure to the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.250
one we see here.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.790
Part of the sales, we

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.510
are resting spending and will

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.330
inform us of different sizes.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.670
We start.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.290
We have some revenue and some

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.830
expenses for purchases, some

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.830
direct costs, some sales costs.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.270
We have included them in the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.570
results and informed us of the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.970
gross margin.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.460
Subsequently, we have deducted

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.500
the variable costs, we will

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.540
deduct the fixed costs, which

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.060
in this case are rent and salaries.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.100
We deduct fixed expenses

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.680
and have EBITDA worth

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.700
$100,000.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.980
We will restate the amortization of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.420
the fixed assets, which

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.080
we will later see what it consists

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.040
of, and we have the EBIT.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.000
EBIT is profit before

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.960
interest and before taxes.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.980
If we subtract interest

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.920
from debt, we have gross

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.400
profit.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.300
And on the gross profit, what we do

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.700
is calculate the corresponding corporate

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.060
tax, which depends on the tax

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.260
rate of each country, and we

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.680
have the result of the exercise,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.840
which is equal to the net

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.560
profit.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.370
Subsequently, we will see how the net

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.050
profit moves to the balance sheet

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.910
on the part that we do not

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.230
distribute among the partners.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.710
There is one part that is distributed

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.490
as dividends and is taken by the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.070
partners, and another part is reinvested

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.750
within the company and increases

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.590
the balance sheet in the part

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.750
of the net asset.
