00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.580
We will analyze the case of Pierre

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.060
Transfer from what Iker told

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.660
us and we will relate

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.520
it to things we have learned.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160
Well, the first thing we were told

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.840
is that the company is born, like

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.280
all success cases, from the identification

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.520
of a problem, in addition

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.680
to a big problem that has a

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.760
lot of people.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.060
And it is that when you are going

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.040
to make international transfers, the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.300
exchange rate applied by the bank makes

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.540
you lose a lot of money.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.200
In his case, he was going to lose

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.160
a thousand euros when he had to pay

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.700
the fees at MIT.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900
Then he decided to create Pierre

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.680
Transfer.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.360
Pierre Transfer is a platform

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.660
that connects individuals

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.820
with individuals or companies

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.520
with companies.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080
It is a peer-to-peer platform.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.580
By the way, I share with you this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.420
evolution of the business model

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420
canvas in which the customer segments

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.880
have them on both sides.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.560
It is a mirror model canvas that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.760
I think reflects very well or

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.520
represents very well the business

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.480
model on the platform.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420
Well, with this initial model, the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.040
value proposal was for both sides,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.500
it’s the savings that are produced

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.840
by making the transfer through

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.400
Pierre Transfer.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.940
What happens is that two things happen.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.940
One, that it is realized that the cost

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.920
of capture is high.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.860
And two, he also realizes that the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.280
universities with which he has a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.180
relationship transmit to him that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.320
they have a problem in the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.800
management of the students’ fees.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.920
Because they receive thousands

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.980
of transfers every year from students

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.020
around the world.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.560
In some cases, for example,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.740
Asians with very similar

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.520
names, etc.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.260
It seems to be very difficult

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.000
to manage that.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.920
At that point, he decided to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.400
develop the business model.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240
And what he creates is a platform

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.280
that instead of being Pierre to Pierre,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.520
what he does is connect

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.100
universities with students.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.320
And the value proposal for

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.060
universities is to manage

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.320
those student fees.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.900
And the value proposal or

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.100
benefit for students is that they

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.380
save a percentage of that transaction

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.300
or that transfer,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.280
forgiveness.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.240
And also something very important

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000
that we will analyze is that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500
the growth strategy improves

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.760
much with this evolution.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.760
Let’s see why.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.660
Usually the platforms have the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.540
challenge, as we have studied

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.280
in other classes, good initially

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.080
to overcome the egg and chicken.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.720


00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.860
And they have the challenge of facing the network,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.820
which if you don’t have users you don’

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.640
t generate value.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.220
One of the solutions as we saw

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.780
is that you are able to create

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.420
value on one side of the platform

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.760
or the marketplace.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.940
Create value for it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.280
regardless of whether there are

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.700
users on the other side or not.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.160
This is called the single value user.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.040
Of course, that allows you in this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.640
case by bringing value as software

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100
to universities.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.940
What allowed him to grow in hundreds

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.320
of universities, including

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.440
universities like MIT or Harvard,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.800
very quickly.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.480
It doesn’t matter if

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.000
there are students or not.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.420
It was simply a software that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.480
was good for universities,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.420
but the second derivative is even

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.020
better.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.500
And another tip we’ve seen is that sometimes

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.460
if you’re able to support yourself in

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.800
another network, in another company,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.940
on another platform that already

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.740
has a critical mass of users, it helps

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.580
you grow a lot.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.700
And in this case, fix yourself, what he

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.200
gets is that he captures

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.380
universities because he brings them a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.820
value, single value user.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.320
But these universities also

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.880
help capture students.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.600
Because to all international

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.340
students who will make transfers

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.660
to that university every year,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.100
the university offers you

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.980
to do so through Pierre Transfer.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.100
This is helping to reduce the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.020
cost of capture considerably.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.980
And this was one of the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.420
keys to Pierre Transfer’

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.380
s growth of 800% per year.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.300
We were told that now the company that

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.840
is now called Flywire, the company

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.620
has returned or incorporated,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.600
in addition to this service

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.440
of connecting universities with students,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380
is incorporating the service

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.460
of Pierre to Pierre.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.660
And if you actually get into

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.020
the website you can hire your

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.860
own transfers.
