00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.400
You have to decide, once you have already

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800
segmented, you already understand your

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.240
market, etc., you already know what

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.400
customers are people and others,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.260
you have to decide who you

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.440
are going to, right?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.820
How many you go, etc.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.120
And well, because we can help a little

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.540
the east model of targeting

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.260
strategies, which in the end are

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.500
the different options we have

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
as to whether to address

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.040
the entire market, segment

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.180
and others.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.100
It is very simple, you have the option

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.860
of the mass market, in which what you

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.740
do is not segment, try to direct

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.460
yourself to the entire market in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.520
an indifferent way.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.700
Decathlon is a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240
sport for all sports

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240
fans.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.520
For example, we will think of real

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.820
estate agencies, because an

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.120
agency like Tecnokasa, for example,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.500
with a very broad proposal

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.080
of properties of many types,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.840
etc.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.000
As you can see, they are trying to capture

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.720
the entire market.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.620
Now, let’s go to the segmentation strategy.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.800
In this case, we are segmenting

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.680
the market.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.960
We have identified that there

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.120
are several segments or several

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.380
different customers, but what

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.060
we do is adapt to each of

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.640
them, we adapt to each of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.980
them.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.920
I can give you an example, I know, Inditex,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.480
because it is a group that has different

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.920
brands because with each brand it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.400
is directed to different segments,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.040
to different customers people.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.380
We have a niche strategy.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.940
In this case, what we do is choose,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.140
it is a strategic decision.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.800
We choose to focus on a niche,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.420
a segment or a very specific

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.460
customer person.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.840
Then we will see the benefits of this.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.000
We focus on him.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.540
Examples, because we can compare

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.540
that before we saw the mass

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.300
market of Decathlon, because we

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.720
will think of a company that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.440
is aimed only at bicycle fans,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.940
for example.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.780
That has a chain of stores for

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.180
cyclists or for runners, for example,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.640
or paddle.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.380
They would be different niches within

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.940
the total sports enthusiast market.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.120
We have seen the example of the real

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.180
estate agency Tecnokasa, because

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.280
we will think of Promora, which

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.300
is a real estate agency that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.320
is mainly in the moraleja,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.680
with properties of much value,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.360
etc.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.340
And we could also include approaches,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.580
micromarketing strategies, such

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.640
as local marketing where

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.980
you are simply targeting

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.280
because you are associated

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.760
with a region.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.840
If you have a restaurant,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.900
this is local marketing.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.020
Individual marketing would be that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.620
you are basically segmenting

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.040
person by person and your proposal

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.200
is adapting it to each of the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.680
people.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.720
And I think, imagine that you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.260
have a consultancy and you almost

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.540
don’t have defined your portfolio

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.280
and what you do is that each of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.080
the customers is creating proposals

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.260
or services adapted to each

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.660
of them.
