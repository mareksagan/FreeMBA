00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.480
Why is the curve of value?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.800


00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.580
Let us see.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.740
To analyze the size of the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.240
market or sector, true or false

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.440
or false, the value curve informs

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.580
us of this.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.280
To analyze external factors,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.080
such as political, economic,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.640
social, no, it has nothing

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.820
to do with the value curve.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580
To understand what the competitors

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.040
in the sector are doing in

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.280
general, yes, the value curve

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.160
tells us very graphically what

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.260
the rest is doing.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.980
To understand what competitors invest

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.360
in and we also, what they invest

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.660
in in order to offer value to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.020
their customers, correct.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.740
To understand what are the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.800
factors or variables

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.100
determining the value proposal,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.380
to understand whether in our

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.300
sector the important or what

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.440
the rest of competitors

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.760
are orienting in price,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.920
quality, design, safety,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.000
effectively.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.260
To understand and visualize the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.300
differences between the value

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.360
proposals of the different

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.900
segments, true.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.700
To have a clearer view of what the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.880
sector in general does, as a starting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.140
point for being able to innovate.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100
Does the value curve help us innovate?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.440
and yes.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.550
Think about the restaurant industry.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.770
What are the main

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.170
competitive factors?

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.710
We will analyze factor by factor

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.110
to see if they are part of the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.810
proposal, of the competitive

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.130
proposal of restaurants in general.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.710
The price?

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.170
and yes.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.570
The gastronomic sophistication?

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.030
and yes.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.570
The environment and the decoration.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.950
and yes.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.470
The convenience of the timetable?

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.890
and yes.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.290
The after-sales service?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.470
The post-sales service is not.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.890
The gastronomic variation?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.170
and yes.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.250
The service of the restaurant

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.190
staff?

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.510
and yes.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.590
Recognition of Marks?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.750
and yes.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.590
The quality of raw materials.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.710
Well, it is clear that it is the after-

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.570
sales service the factor that does

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.550
not correspond here.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.460
In general, for each factor

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.480
of when we analyze a value

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.780
curve, for each of the factors,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.640
when we are drawing a higher

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.960
point, a higher curve, what

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.180
does that mean?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.060
More investment?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.300
Yes is correct.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.980
To offer a higher value, you usually

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.260
have to invest more.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.040
And a higher value?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.820
Both answers are correct.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.440
Let's see, this curve of value, do

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.420
you think this curve of value corresponds

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.200
to an online bank?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.620
Let's see the points.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.340
High security, high profitability,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.520
high gram of products, high office

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.020
and cash.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.860
That is, it invests a lot in the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.280
capillary of offices and cashers.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.380
This is not an online

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.620
bank.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.520
That is, this is false.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.110
And now we look at the orange

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.130
color value curve.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.330
In this case, we say that it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.670
corresponds with a bank or

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.750
a proposal mainly online.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.710
And we see that the difference

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.830
from their traditional cometors

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.170
is, it is mainly here, in

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.270
offices and cash.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.190
In this case, the orange curve has

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.750
deinvested in offices and cash.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.710
It is obvious that it is

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.810
an online bank.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.950
Innovation in value, which was

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.950
described in the Blue Ocean

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.050
strategy, contradicts one of the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.410
most accepted paradigms in

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.090
business strategy, which contradicts

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.150
Michael Porter's generic

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.350
strategies, which told us

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.330
that we must choose between

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.370
differentiation and cost

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.870
leadership.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.690
The company that has a value curve

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.490
here above, the yellow, seeks

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.130
its competitive advantage

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.910
from the differentiation of

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.150
cost leadership or value

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.870
innovation.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.210
It seems like a clear curve of company

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.950
seeking differentiation that has

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.230
invested in all the factors to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.270
offer superior value to its

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.430
customers.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.730
Traditional strategic knowledge,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.710
mainly Porter's generic strategies,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.870
have taught us how to compete

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.890
in red oceans, i.e.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.130
in mature markets

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.770
where competitive warfare

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.070
jumps, etc.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.250
Looking for the blue ocean.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.690
Everything we've learned so

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.170
far helps us compete in

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.930
red oceans.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.530
Traditional strategic knowledge

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.230
has taught us to choose or

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.830
combine between increasing

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.890
the value offered and reducing

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.530
the cost for the company.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.490
We are always taught to choose

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.430
from them.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.870
Michael Porter once said that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.330
we have to choose between differentiation

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.750
and cost leadership.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.550


00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.210
The strategic focus of the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.030
blue ocean strategy is,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.250
let's see, not to compete

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.670
frontally within the current

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.270
market.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.330
and correct.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.970
Looking for a new market.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.350
and correct.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.690
Innovation in value.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.370
and correct.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.510
Think about non-customers.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.030
The four correspond to the strategic

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.190
approach of the Blue Ocean

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.690
Strategy.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.030
Why is the Blue Ocean

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.650
Strategy?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.030
To be better than our

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.030
competitors?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.430
The blue ocean strategy teaches us

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.230
to innovate, teaches us to get

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.130
out of the market, the red ocean.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.150
It is not directly teaching us

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.930
to compete, to focus on our competitors

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.070
and to be better.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.110
Innovation in value, what does

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.710
it mean?

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.070
Increase value for the customer

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.450
and reduce price?

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.030
Increase value for the customer

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.750
and reduce cost for the company.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.670
This is second.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.350
It's not just about lowering

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.490
the price, you may not lower the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.610
price, you may even increase it.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.890
What is needed is to reduce

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.330
the cost for the company.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.130
A blue ocean is a new market space

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.170
where there is no current

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.150
or future competition.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.170
Or a new market space that will

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.790
allow you to grow without having

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.630
to wear out in competitive

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.730
warfare and at least initially.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.210
The B response is more appropriate

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.570
because a blue ocean will arrive

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.550
on a day when it becomes a

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.530
red ocean.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.670
That means you won't get rid of the

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.690
competition forever.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.090
Companies usually address

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.990
the same customers with

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.290
similar proposals, which forces

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.530
them to compete frontally

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.770
with each other.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.450
Well, this phrase is correct and

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.810
is very representative of the

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.890
general myopia with which almost

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.310
all companies act or act.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.590
It is not to rethink things.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.670
The best tool to evolve

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.830
your value curve we've learned,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.750
which is it?

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.650
The Pest Matrix, the RIC matrix,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.970
think about non-customers or

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.490
the Boston Consulting Group matrix.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.650
This is the RIC matrix.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.810
How can the cost be reduced?

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.050
Reducing, increasing, eliminating

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.310
or creating.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.390
Well, then reducing and

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.030
eliminating investment in some of

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.350
the factors, as the RIC matrix

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.010
teaches us.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.310
And when we are talking about creating

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.590
within the RIC matrix, what are

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.570
we talking about?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.710
It is a factor that no one in the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.850
industry has taken into account.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.430
Either to improve the service

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.210
to offer a higher value or

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.110
to improve the service to

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.810
increase the price.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.870
The answer is actually A.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.050
Creating a factor is exactly that.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.910
It is to incorporate values or factors

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.470
that had never been taken into account.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.730
That is why we talk about creating.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.070
The RIC matrix helps us create

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.830
value innovation.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.550
This means reducing the cost for the

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.450
company and increasing the value

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.610
offered to the entire market.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.530
Increase value offered to a segment

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.750
of customers or non-customers.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.690
The correct answer is B.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.310
You cannot offer a value that is

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.710
higher than the entire market.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.870
What you have to think about is

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.330
a customer segment and offer greater

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.410
value to that customer segment.
