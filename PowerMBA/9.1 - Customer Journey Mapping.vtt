WEBVTT

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.840
Well, what we're going to do now

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.960
is let's see some example that

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320
I think will help you really illustrate

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.800
how Customer Journey Mapping

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.400
is done.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.060
And I propose that we start with

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.440
Cavify, which is a company that

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.940
for us I understand you know almost

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.700
everyone and those who don't know

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.500
it is a model similar to Uber, it is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160
a competitor of Uber that in Spain

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.600
is the leader and is very strong

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600
also in Latin America.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The first thing we have to do

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.360
is identify all Cavify touch

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.140
points with the customer, from

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.120
the customer's perspective.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.240
I would separate them here in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.660
two moments, two very important

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.860
stages and I recommend you do so,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.380
when you do a Customer Journey

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.480
Mapping, there is a phase, let's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.160
say it is the phase before

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.180
the purchase and there is a phase

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.480
after, and the phase after

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.600
is the phase that is related

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.500
to the provision of the service.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.740
If we optimize the stages in the

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.920
purchase or conversion panel, what

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.020
we're going to get is more customers

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.580
and if we optimize or improve

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160
the customer experience with

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
our customers, well, because

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.160
we're going to get to have more

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.840
satisfied customers, basically,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.000
we're going to be seeing the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640
two main benefits.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.120
We will do it with Cavify.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.460
In Cavify, if we draw the customer'

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.540
s journey, mainly in the initial

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.340
stages, it's, well, because

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.280
you enter the app store,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.200
the App Store, Google Play,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.140
download the app, create

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.460
your account, enter

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.720
your credit card, enter

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.620
your data, etc.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.780
This is a normal journey, like

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.420
any other application.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.700
Cavify has to optimize the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.100
entire process, that the user

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260
experience is good, etc., so

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.160
that the conversion rates

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.580
are the highest possible,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.140
but nothing new.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700
We will put a little more focus on

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
designing the customer's journey

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.400
in the provision of Cavify service.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.760
We will do it with this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.660
structure, we will do it with

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.120
a simpler structure.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.920
We'll describe what the customer

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.020
does, we'll describe what it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.580
looking for or what the challenges

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.900
or the problem are or what

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.620
the customer feels and finally

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.000
what Cavify does or how you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.580
can optimize it.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.820
When you use the Cavify service,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.040
the first thing you do is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.100
get into the app and ask

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.680
for a car.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.580
You enter the app, enter your

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580
address and tell where you want to go.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.580
Well, at this point, what is the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.320
customer's real concern or what

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.540
is what they want at this stage.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.280
I think the main thing is that the customer

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.520
wants to know how much it will cost

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.150
and how much they have to wait.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.210
Basically, because if you compare it with

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.250
alternative services like a taxi,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.510
because in the taxi you don't even

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.330
know how much it will cost and in many

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.010
cases, well, because the waiting

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.670
is relative.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.090
Sometimes you have to wait, sometimes

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.710
not.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.130
So what is it, how can Cavify

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.530
or how does it, how has it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.370
optimized this?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.570
What he does is, he tells you about

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.450
the price, at that moment he

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.550
tells you how much it will cost

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.790
you, he is taking that worry

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.670
away and also tells you the estimated

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.590
time.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.770
And goes beyond.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.430
And what it does is tell you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.470
the exact location of the car that you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.390
assign.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.450
Therefore, it is giving

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.850
response, as you can see, is giving

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.450
very clear response to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.530
customer concerns to optimize

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.450
the customer experience, the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.610
customer experience.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.990
The next thing you do when you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.010
order the car is wait.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.190
And usually what you do is,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.430
from time to time, check

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.510
the app to see where the car is.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.290
Why is it?

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.790
Because you worry, you've been told

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.910
that it takes 10 minutes, but you'

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.370
re not constantly looking at the clock.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.030
So the concern is when

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.010
it will come.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.430
Or even the worry will be, but

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.990
eventually it will come or it won'

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.330
t come.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.010
How did Cavify manage to optimize

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.830
this?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.730
What it does is, it tells you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.190
the exact real-time location,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.410
as we said before the car, at

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.290
all times you see it on a map.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.230
You are looking at a map where the car

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.570
is and how much time it has left.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.470
It is being updated in real time.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.910
And what they do is

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.970
incorporate the driver'

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.590
s phone from Cavify so you

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.030
can call him at any time.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.830
As you can see, it includes

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.490
features, functionalities that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.930
are absolutely targeted at

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.050
the customer's concerns in each

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.590
of the touch points.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.590
Then comes the moment when your car

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.190
has already arrived and it's the journey.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.130
And this is normal.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.730
What is what you want?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.970
Well be comfortable, be

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.450
pleasant, be a deal Cavify has

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.690
absolutely care of the customer

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.070
experience.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.110
They offer you water, call you by

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.250
your name, ask you if they want

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.230
you to put the music or not, etc.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.070
You are very careful.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.710
And after the trip, because you

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.110
have to consider all the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.110
contact points, after the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.990
trip the customer can still

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.390
have some concerns.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.850
How much has it cost me?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.710
Sometimes you want to consult it or

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.010
sometimes what you want is to share your

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.870
opinion.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.010
Well, Cavify has included both features

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.210
because they send you an email

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.350
in which they effectively tell you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.890
how much it has cost you and what

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.030
your route has been and also allows

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.230
you to give a rating.
