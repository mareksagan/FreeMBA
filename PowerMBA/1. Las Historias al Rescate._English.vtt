00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.580
I want us to learn how to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.860
improve our company communications

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.980
with the aim of selling

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320
more.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.220
Usually can fail mainly for two

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.640
reasons, either because the

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.000
product is not good enough,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.020
that is not something that concerns

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.700
us now, or because we are

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.940
not able to communicate

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.760
it well.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.020
Both reasons have a lot of weight.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.390
First, I want to contextualize

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.290
what we are referring to by communication.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.550
Well, you have in mind that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.910
all companies communicate with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.010
customers through very many

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.370
supports, through the website,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.950
through all the ads we put

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.710
on online channels, offline,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.450
etc., through emails, through

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.570
the PDFs that generate

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.670
product files, through the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.270
pitch of each of the sellers

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.550
whenever they are in contact

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.150
with a customer,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.330
etc.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.150
What we have to do is optimize,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.850
improve, give a script, give a

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.290
content, a format to all those

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.390
communications with the aim

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.490
of selling more.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.750
And what we’re going to do is learn

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.270
from Donald Miller and Story

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510
Brand, one of the world’s

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.030
biggest experts in copyrighting,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.270
communication and creating

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.070
interesting stories.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.930
He has sold millions of books, from

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.090
the book Story Brand I recommend,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310
I will leave you the link

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.170
and as a consultant helps many

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.190
companies to clarify their

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.750
messages, it is their main

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.110
value, the value proposal,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.170
clarify the message.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.030
Let’s see what are the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.830
two main mistakes that most

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.990
companies make.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.710
The first is the content

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.190
of communications and I mean the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.630
following, it is that they do

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.170
not focus on the important.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.450
Most importantly, you must

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.750
always keep in mind and you must

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.210
pass on to your customers,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.890
that your product, your brand,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.470
your service, that you are

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.890
there to make their lives

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.610
better, to solve a problem.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.730
This said so is a speech and you

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.590
say good but that how it applies,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.730
well we will see how it applies,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.850
but you have to have absolutely

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.810
clear, you have to identify

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.130
how you will help them, what

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.910
problem you will solve and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.510
this, this message has to be

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.290
absolutely behind all the communications

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.490
you do.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.210
I tell you because almost all companies

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.010
lose focus, forget about this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.290
and start talking about other

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.250
things and all you talk about other

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.610
things, about the characteristics

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.610
of your product, about what you have

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.050
achieved, bla bla bla bla bla, what

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.870
you are doing is to lose focus

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.050
and what you are doing is go to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.610
something that the customer does

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.590
not care because the customer

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.170
buys you because you help him

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.490
with something, point, so is.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.250
This is the first of the mistakes and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.470
we go to the second,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.730
are the ways, that is, that costs

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.690
too much effort to understand that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.650
message, it has to be clear,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.810
there has to be nothing of noise,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.910
in many companies what happens

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.710
is that it has because that diversity

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.590
of products or that have not done

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.670
well the exercise we will learn

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.790
to do us these days, then in the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.330
end they transmit a lot of

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.470
messages and it costs too

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.890
much effort to understand it.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.590
As Donald Miller tells us, clarity

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.610
in messages, clarification

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.990
of your message has a bestial

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:36.020
impact on sales and we could

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.280
do a test and we could do it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.080
by picking up the website or brochures

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.660
or advertisements of very many

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.580
companies and it is a test in

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.280
which we have to validate if in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220
the first five seconds, you open

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.840
a website, in the first five seconds

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840
we from our customer perspective

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.700
gives us a answer to three questions,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.680
what is what you offer me, that

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.240
is, what is what you do, what

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.400
you sell, this is not enough

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.640
for me to buy you, how it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.180
will help me, is the key and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.260
what is what I have to do to

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.900
buy it, if you are able in

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.840
five seconds to answer these

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.880
three questions that

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880
customers have in mind you

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.520
will be much better than

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.240
now.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520
Well we already know what are the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.060
mistakes, as I told you the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.300
main mistakes is not to focus because

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.000
we are out of focus, because we have

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.580
forgotten that the only important

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.140
thing is to transmit to the customer

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.880
permanently, that we are here

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.700
to solve a problem that you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.100
have or to make your life better

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.200
and also not know how to communicate

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.640
those messages more or less simple,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.440
a lot of noise, many unconnected

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.660
communications, it costs us

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.200
too much mental effort, we

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.400
burn too many calories

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400
reading what you are transmitting

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.760
to me, sure it has been

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.240
millions of times.
