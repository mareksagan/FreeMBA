WEBVTT

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.860
The goal of this type of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.160
introduction is to know how

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.240
the program is structured,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.640
what are the areas, especially

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.540
to understand what are the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540
benefits or objectives of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.680
each of the areas.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.060
We will not go into the details of the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.420
whole syllable, that is, of all

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.920
the courses we incorporate, because

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.340
that is what you have on the website.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.200
As I tell you, the benefits, why

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.240
will serve us all the knowledge

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.260
you will acquire.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.860
The first thing I want you to keep

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760
in mind is that The Power MBA

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.360
is structured in a number of areas

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.400
that we have in screen strategy,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.780
innovation, entrepreneurship,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200
marketing, finance and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940
accounting and management.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340
Before I go into the details

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.360
of each of them, I want

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.140
to share with you a few

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.000
thoughts.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.980
The first is that the Power MBA is

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.140
a complete program, it is an

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.320
MBA program.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.120
What implication does it have?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.260
It incorporates all areas.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.360
This is not about being a digital

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.020
marketing expert or being an

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.500
accounting expert, no.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.880
The goal is not that.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.240
The goal is to have a comprehensive

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
vision of the business.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.500
The goal is to understand the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.560
company from all perspectives.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.240
Why is?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.460
When you do that, you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280
see things much clearer.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.800
I'll always talk about

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
the puzzle.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.480
You when you have a puzzle with the pieces

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.100
all apart is that you don't know

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.240
what's there, right?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.320
But you start to mount the puzzle and one

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320
day you have it all mounted and you see

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.560
the image and you see it very clearly.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.200
We also sometimes put the example

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440
of glasses or putting on a lens.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.220
If you have, I know, if you have

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.940
myopia or astigmatism, as in my case,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.540
because I don't wear lenses and I

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.380
see nothing.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.540
I put on my lenses and I see

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.040
things very clearly.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.600
That is the objective.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.900
From now on, you can understand

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.920
the world of the company in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.440
a much simpler way.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.580
As I said, we don'

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.920
t need expert.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.560
We don't want you to be an expert

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.380
in anything.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.500
What we want is that you are

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.040
trained to be successful in the world

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.720
of the company.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.700
And we believe that the best

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.440
way is this.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.640
Have that comprehensive view.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.600
By the way, this concept of the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.620
MBA, of the entire program, this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.860
we did not invent.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.060
This is something that traditionally

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.420
MBAs, that is, people who have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.920
done an MBA, in our case a Power

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.400
MBA, as they get further.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.480
It has always been so.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420
As I said, it is a complete

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.140
program.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.600
What happens is that while

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.000
we haveined the MBA philosophy,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.780
we have been innovative in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.700
many things.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.600
Basically, what we have innovated

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.040
is that within each of those

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.520
areas, the content, the models,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.300
the tools and the rest we

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.580
share with you, are

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.660
usually much more up-to-date.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.600
These are things in which we have

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.780
innovated, which we have

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.340
identified from the most advanced

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.220
knowledge.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.440
We have selected the most useful,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.600
most up-to-date and most practical

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.220
models and tools.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.800
Always with that goal, let them

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.000
be knowledge that will serve you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.040
for something.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.240
Another factor in how the program

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.180
is structured is that it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.800
has a script.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.500
This is like a series, as many

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.840
students say, like a series on

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.140
Netflix or like a movie.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.940
It doesn't matter, it has a script.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.340
You have to start with strategy

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.020
and you have to move forward and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.940
you will build your learning

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.060
in this way.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.740
I advance, because it is so, that I am

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.000
sure there are areas that interest

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.500
you more than others or you have even

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.880
been able to incorporate Power MBA because

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.160
you want to learn from something

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.740
specific.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.560
It does not matter.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.660
In the end, the goal is that you understand

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.460
and learn from everything, because

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.600
you will be able to put it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.560
much more in value.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.820
That is, if you want to be an expert

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.000
in digital marketing, that's fine, if

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.260
you don't understand the strategy,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.820
if you don't understand the finances,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.280
if you don't understand weeks, well,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.960
because you'll take less advantage

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.460
of that specific knowledge.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.680
It is true that depending on

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.860
your current situation or your

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.320
professional goals, there

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.100
may be areas or subjects

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.240
or models to which you can

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.920
get a faster return.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.240
If you want to build a company, then

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.900
it is likely that it will be very useful

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.300
or transformative for you everything

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.560
that is relevant to the in-startup.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.480
You also have to know about

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.680
finance, because if not, the day

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.660
you mount a company, you will

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.520
miss a lot of things.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.560
Now let's see what the different

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600
areas are.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.860
Let us go into a little more detail.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.820
We start with strategy.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.880
Why with strategy?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.500
Because strategy is the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.580
basis of knowledge.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.980
It is the basis of knowledge on

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.260
which we will build everything else.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720
We can summarize here or we can

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.000
highlight two benefits you will

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.860
get with the strategy area.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.920
First, you will become

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.040
a real strategic

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.300
consultant.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.880
What is this concrete in?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.880
You will understand everything

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.800
much better.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.460
It's like what we've told before

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.700
the pieces fit.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.320
You can see everything much

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.060
clearer.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.040
If now, for example, I ask you

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.160
to analyze Amazon's growth

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.740
strategy, then you're sure to

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.160
do a chaotic analysis.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.640
You don't even know where to start.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.440
But after you know the tools

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.600
you'll see in the strategy area,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.220
when you understand well,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.760
because I don't know what vertical

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.460
integration consists of or what

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.680
are the differences between

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.840
organic or inorganic growth.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.260
Or the Ansoft matrix, for

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.720
example, things that come to my mind.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.420
Sure, if I ask you to analyze

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.580
Amazon's growth strategy,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.340
you just have to use those tools

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.580
to see everything very

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.340
clearly and to explain it

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.140
phenomenally.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.200
That is simple.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.600
And it's just like

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.900
tools you know now.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.340
I don't know, depending on your level.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.320
But I guarantee you that even if they

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.020
don't sound like anything, you'll learn

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.300
them very simply because they're tools

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.680
that are very intuitive,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.600
they're very easy, they're very easy

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.940
to understand, they're very easy

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.620
to incorporate into your head.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.180
How will we it?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.500
As I am telling you, we incorporate

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.060
all those models, all those

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.920
tools into our mental

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.860
structure.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.140
And from that point on, all

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.020
analysis is processed through

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.960
those tools.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.820
As I said, you will see everything

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.820
much clearer.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.380
I give you an example.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.860
I give you another example.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.980
Do you want to analyze innovation

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.140
in a company's value proposition?

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.060
It is a very innovative company.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.860
Imagine the Power MBA, for example.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.080
How do you analyze the disruption

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.080
of The Power MBA in its market

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.220
with respect to business schools?

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.080
As I told you, if I ask you to

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.620
do it now, you start telling

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.100
things disorderly.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.880
But if you rely on a tool

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.340
like the value curve, for example,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.540
then you're sure that your analysis

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.840
instead of being chaotic

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.680
is much more orderly.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.220
You can explain it much

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.380
better.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.700
As we have seen, you will be

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.600
able to do some beastly analysis.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.700
You will see everything very clearly.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.920
That was the first of the

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.620
benefits we have given him the

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.740
name that you will become a

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.240
strategic consultant.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.600
The second benefit, and it is

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.420
a consequence of the above,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.860
is to see the clearer things

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.060
of being a true strategic

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.640
consultant, is that decisions

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.560
are made much better.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.380
When you understand things,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.440
it's easier to make good decisions.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.420
If you make a wrong diagnosis,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.780
then the decisions you make later

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.180
are probably not right.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.580
By the way, what will happen to

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.180
you, I tell you, because we are told

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.340
by hundreds of students, is that you

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.600
will come up with thousands of ideas.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.860
The head will be in permanent boiling.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.640
You will be able to constantly

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.500
identify better opportunities.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.440
By the way, all this knowledge that

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.680
we will acquire in the area of strategy

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.800
we will reinforce it with very many

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.920
cases, with cases that you will

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.220
love, with cases that will

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.440
inspire you.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.180
The cases are also very

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.360
important and you'll see

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.940
it to relate the theory,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.580
concepts, models to real life.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.860
Because it helps us understand

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.600
or visualize how we can put all

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.600
that knowledge into practice.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.000
How to make it a reality.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.320
Or how others did.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.440
In the area of innovation

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.860
and entrepreneurship we have incorporated

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.420
an additional module called The

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.380
Power Launch Formula, which in

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.100
short is a step-by-step guide,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.920
a very practical formula

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.580
that accompanies you on the

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.660
way of creating and launching

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.340
an innovative business

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.240
model.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.920
It's more practical, it's more detailed,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.360
it takes more time, it's a

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.640
formula, not a method, step by step.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.460
What are the reasons why we have

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.120
decided to create The Power Launch

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.300
Formula and offer it to the

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.360
Power MBA students?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.340
The first is that you have

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.640
asked us.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.540
Hundreds of people contact us because

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.620
they want us to accompany them more

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.960
on the road.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.300
On the way, that of identifying

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.640
ideas, of launching

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.880
ideas, of consolidating

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.280
projects, etc.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.860
And that is impossible.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.740
Because as you will learn, that model

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.420
does not scale and would be much

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.160
more expensive.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.080
The hours of each person's counseling

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.580
are much more expensive, it

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.280
would cost a lot more.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.520
So what we did, as we can't

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.320
do that, what we did is wrap

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.080
the method we follow when

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.140
we advise entrepreneurs

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.680
or companies and others,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.100
wrap it into a formula.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.500
Then you will get 80% of the value,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.320
you will get it by only applying

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.480
it to your project, applying

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.660
it to your ideas.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.360
But much more efficiently,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.560
as we always like Power Envie,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.080
at a super affordable price.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.040
Another reason is that to be truly

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.440
good in this, innovating, we have

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.540
to anchor, we have to first transform

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.840
our way of thinking and therefore

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
we have to anchor it because

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.160
it is that we usually then let

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.480
us drag by the current, it happens

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.860
to us that we take, sometimes

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.760
we make bad decisions, we let

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.360
us be taken by traditional thinking

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.040
and that is why we have

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.620
created a formula that obliges

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.840
us to make good decisions

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.760
because if you apply it

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.140
to the rajatabla, you

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.180
can not let you take

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.360
by the current.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.720
Who is Power Launch Formula for?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.120
Of course, it's not for everyone,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.980
so it's extra.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.680
If you want to make a greater effort

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.360
in terms of time and in terms

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.620
of cost, then perfect.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.540
And you're sure you get it a great

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.460
return, but let's see for whom.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.040
The first thing for everyone who

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.140
at some point wants to undertake,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.840
dreams of changing their life, launching

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.900
a new project and others, regardless

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.620
of whether they have the idea or

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.040
not because we will incorporate

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.000
that methodology and identification

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.100
of ideas.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.060
The second of the segments, and

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.180
this is the one that is really most

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.200
recommended, is all those you already

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.820
have projects in progress, in which

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.200
you have invested money, you have

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.300
already taken a risk.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.580
When you take a risk, you'

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.140
re gambling your life, then

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.180
any help is good.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.520
And finally, I would

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.640
recommend it to entrepreneurs

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.880
because entrepreneurs are always

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.060
thinking about innovation,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.440
so being very good at innovating

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.700
can become a real competitive

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.240
advantage.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.300
Marketing is a very interesting

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.160
area and it is also the favorite

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.480
area for many people, now it

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.720
is the most sexy area.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.180
Everyone wants to learn from

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.220
marketing, but it has all the

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.560
sense of the world because when

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.940
you become a real marketing

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.720
expert, there are four counted,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.620
but it's not hard, when

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.560
you're very good at this

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.240
you can grow the sales

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.360
volume of any company,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.660
you can grow the business

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.740
volume.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.500
And that, imagine, is worth

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.500
a lot of money.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.320
You become, as I said, a much

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.180
more valuable professional.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.960
The ultimate goal we've seen

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.440
is that you're able to increase

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.280
the business volume.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.700
But how will we do it?

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.020
Well, we'll look at different

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.060
courses, but I think we could summarize

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.080
it mainly in three levers.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.800
On the one hand, it will help us

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.960
to understand our customers much better.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.340
We will look at tools that will help

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.400
us to do so, such as the customer

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.260
person, or for example analyze

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.640
the customer journey, the customer

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.300
journey.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.880
You will be an expert in making good segments.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.380
The customer is always the most important.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.660
There are many companies that

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.920
forget about the customer, but I tell

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.260
you that when you are able

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.840
to know, understand your customers,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.420
even better than they themselves,

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.400
when you know what hurts them,

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.380
when you know what messages

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.280
come to their heart, what

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.580
lever you have to touch, etc.,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.060
it is that everything else

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.320
is very easy.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.010
One conclusion of this,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.010
one consequence is that

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.910
we will learn using words, messages,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.570
to reach the hearts of customers,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.730
to connect much better

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.970
with them.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.610
And that will help us sell more,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.870
will help us to better structure

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.030
our campaigns, to have more

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.630
return on everything we do.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.150
We also learn how to

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.930
use channels, especially

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.170
digital channels.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.210
You will learn to capture,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.950
convert, and fidelize customers,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.270
and become an expert in digital

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.190
marketing.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.300
I'll start by quoting Yartrude, who

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.440
is one of the greatest gurus in the

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.220
history of marketing, the father

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.880
of concepts like positioning.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.660
And said something like, the perfect

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.760
CEO is a marketing expert,

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.700
you should already be a marketing

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.580
expert, who also knows how to read

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.780
a balance sheet.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.780
I think this phrase summarizes the

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.920
importance of understanding finance

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.140
and accounting well.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.080
If you don't understand them, you lack

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.740
a vital perspective in the world of

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.020
the company.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.640
It is basically impossible for you

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.680
to understand the world of the company

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.580
properly if you don't understand

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.480
the numbers behind it.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.680
What will we learn?

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.660
Well, we will learn many very important

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.180
things like knowing how to value

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.180
the income of the company,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.680
know what are the financial

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.700
statements, the accounting statements.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.240
You will be familiar with key

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.820
concepts, with key magnitudes

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.900
and absolutely necessary for a

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.480
Power MBA like ROE, like ROE,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.660
like EBITDA, I don't know, there

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.420
are many.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.140
You will understand what the different

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.320
financing alternatives are,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.980
how you should finance a project, a

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.920
company, you will know how to value

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.720
investments, you will know how

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.300
to value companies and more.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.920
This area is a bigger challenge

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.460
for several reasons.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.820
First, because there are people

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.100
with different levels of knowledge

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.760
in finance and accounting.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.800
Per for some it needs a greater

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.020
effort than for others, but we

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.580
recommend that everyone do

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.400
it, even if you have done an

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.540
MBA before, you have done the

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.600
AD career, because I assure you

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.920
it will help you to strengthen

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.460
your knowledge a lot.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.320
Another challenge is that, and we

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.460
must be honest, in the area of

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.440
finance and accounting, a greater

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.940
effort is needed to assimilate

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.560
all those concepts.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.700
When we learn about marketing

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.980
or when we learn about strategy,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.200
it's very fun.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.760
In the case of finance and accounting,

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.780
learning is a little more, you

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.420
have to go building progressively

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.640
from concepts that you have to

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.800
bury well in your head, because

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.020
otherwise, it's like if the

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.000
foundations are not solid,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.320
you won't understand it too.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.210
The last area we call leading

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.490
organizations is usually

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.030
known as management.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.430
Management is the translation of management.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.690
Within this area you will

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.850
find different courses that

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.770
have slightly different

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.810
goals, but in the end the great

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.230
benefit of what you will learn

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.790
or what you will be able to create

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.350
organizations that are excellent

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.990
and that help you to

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.570
your strategic goals.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.050
That is what we will.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.370
And how will we it?

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.570
As I said, with different

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.170
tools.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.730
First you have to be very aware,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.030
you have to be able to define

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.070
the direction of an organization,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.870
for example, knowing

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.590
how to define the mission,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.030
vision, values, etc.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.250
You have to understand the importance

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.370
of all this, that there are a lot of

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.350
people who don't do it and that'

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.030
s why companies are usually out of the box.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.230
You need to understand the styles of leadership.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.190
You need to know how to apply the right

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.390
leadership style to your organization.

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.690
You need to understand the

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.270
different types of business culture.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.590
The culture also has to be very

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.350
coherent with your sector, with your

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.730
goals and others.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.310
You need to know the different

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.070
organizational structures.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.370
We have the functional, the

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.610
divisional, the matricial.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.410
This will help us understand

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.890
any type of organization.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.230
You have to be very good

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.490
at managing people, managing

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.090
human resources throughout your

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.570
life, because people are the

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.050
most valuable resource or

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.490
asset we have.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.830
You have to be able to manage projects

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.490
and we will do so based on

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.270
Ajay's philosophy.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.250
In addition, you will learn a system

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.510
that we love of organization

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.210
management called OKRs, which

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.910
we will see, which will help you

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.790
align all the efforts that come

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.950
out in your company with

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.110
strategic goals.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.000
In conclusion, I will share with

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.440
you a reflection that we love

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.780
and repeat a lot.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.980
To be successful in the business

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.740
world, you don't need to

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.720
be a visionary.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.540
You don't have to wake up

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.480
with a happy idea.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.480
You do not need to have

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.960
special abilities.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.960
When you acquire knowledge,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.280
when you integrate tools, models

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.760
in your head, when you have

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.960
analyzed dozens of success

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.680
and failure cases, you will

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.800
be much more prepared to make

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.520
good decisions, you

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.420
will be much more prepared

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.560
to have professional success.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.900
All this knowledge

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.320
is now available to you.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.800
You will buy it in the coming months.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.600
So I really encourage you to make

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.980
the most out of it always

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.400
with the aim that it helps you

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.940
pursue your dreams or your professional

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.600
goals, whether it is to scale

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.260
professionally, become

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.980
a more valuable professional,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.180
launch a new company or convert

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.200
your company or scale your

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.220
current company.
