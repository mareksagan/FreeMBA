00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940
Cris, throughout the program

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.060
we have analyzed the different

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.280
types of cultures, using various

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.520
models as well, and the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.400
ways in which a company

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.180
can be organized.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.300
Then I would love to have

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.280
you analyze, in your case, in the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.380
case of Pernod Ricard, what kind

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200
of culture is predominant now,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.720
what are your goals, and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.860
that you put us examples

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.200
that help us understand why your

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
culture is of one type or

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.460
another.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.160
We currently have an adocratic

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
culture, although it is true

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.720
that we come from a clanique

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.600
culture, our goal is to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900
become a 100% adocratic culture.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.740
What are we doing for that?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.920
Adocratic cultures are

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.640
agile cultures where the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.420
levels of bureaucracy

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.740
are minimal.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.180
A clear example in this case, for

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.620
example, how do we, our

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.140
commercials, settle the bills

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.980
of expenses?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.140
Traditionally they had to get into

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.000
an excel and had to put ticket per

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.980
ticket all the information of

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.100
the tickets that they had to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.440
send then in that excel to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.860
their manager.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.620
In this case, we have developed

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.660
a tool that is available in the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.100
market, that the commercials make

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.920
a photo of that ticket and directly

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380
all the data go up to the system

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.140
and send it to their boss for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.440
approval, with which you

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.080
win a lot of time and a lot of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.160
agility and the commercials

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.520
can focus on providing

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520
value and not so much on

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.060
administrative tasks that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.180
take them so much time.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.060
Effectively bureaucracy, I think

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.240
this will understand everyone who

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.260
has worked in a large company,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.760
although also in small companies

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.040
in many cases they are making inefficiencies,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.740
bureaucracy what obliges you

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.980
is to be dedicating a percentage

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.480
of your time and your effort

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.040
to things that do not

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.300
bring any value.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300
In very hierarchical, very functional

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.900
companies, bureaucracy has always

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.020
been a scam in this sense.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.320
You are innovating, using technology

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.000
so that people from the time they

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.900
arrive at their job until they

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.080
leave at night are creating

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.720
the corresponding of their

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.080
job.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.240
actually is.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.140
Another initiative we are

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.220
doing is to speed up decision-

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.940
making, we have created different

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.040
decision groups beyond the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.440
management committee, that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840
is, traditional companies do

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.760
what the management committee

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.440
makes all the decisions,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.560
both strategic and operational.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.740
We have created a group that

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.280
is the direct reports

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.440
of this management committee,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.360
in our case we have

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.820
a management committee

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.100
composed of six people

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.980
and these six people report

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.780
40.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
So what we did is this group

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.720
we have given them an entity

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.240
and a responsibility to make

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.140
operational decisions that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.680
speed up a lot, so that you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.160
now have 40 people with the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.080
responsibility and the entity

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.140
enough to make decisions

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.960
about the six you had

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.800
previously.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.700
So we don’t have to issue it all,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.140
that is, we just now report

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.920
it to the management committee

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.940
and before you just present

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.620
it to them for approval.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520
It has been won very quickly.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.700
Many, many, many, you realize

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.460
that now there are 40 people

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.660
making operational decisions

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.100
and it is an agility that in

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.500
times logically.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.880
Of course, in addition to 40 more

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.600
people stuck in the day-to-day operative

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.360
that make decisions at that time

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.560
with the knowledge they have versus

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.640
reporting to the boss that is in

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.920
the management committee you have

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.480
to explain, you have to put

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.320
it in context because it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.500
is not so put in the day-to-

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.640
day that they meet, make the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.460
decision, etc.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.340
That is, you get a lot of speed.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.780
Another example of how we move

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.300
towards the culture of autocracy, the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.340
channels of communication.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.800
Nowadays, any company has

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.520
many communication channels

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.900
but they are not always

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.460
managed effectively.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.940
A good example here

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.280
is our offices.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.440
We have been in a new office for

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.440
a year and a half where there are

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.740
no offices and then you arrive one

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.000
day in the morning and sit where

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.360
you want and where you want you

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.220
can be next to the company’s

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.060
general manager or next to the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.720
chief of administration.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.040
This allows you to eliminate

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.360
the barriers or barriers

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.220
that were previously present.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.740
In this sense, for example,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.520
we organize very many meetings

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.240
beyond the presencials, that is,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.380
at best the management committee

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.720
calls us to the entire company,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.540
that not all of us are in Madrid

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.960
because we have a network of

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.800
sales across Spain, calls

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.700
us to a meeting by Skype where

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.020
it informs us of how we go to goals.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.080
That is what has meant, because

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.000
very much transparency when communicating

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.740
because employees are informed

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.160
at all times of how we are at

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.900
the level of goals and logically

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.380
very much efficiency

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.540
and effectiveness when communicating.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.600


00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.100
What you say about the office in

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.640
small companies, that is more or

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.540
less natural by the space itself,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.060
although it is true that each has

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.480
its place and you are saying that

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.400
you do not have assigned positions,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.680
but man, in traditional small companies

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.420
it is true that the manager before

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.480
was separated in a desk, which

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.740
makes him a little more

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.060
inaccessible, but in large the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.440
problem is usually that you

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.300
are very far from your bosses,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300
then communication flows badly

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.880
especially from below up and

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.960
it is also true that you are

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.260
very far from other departments

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.640
or other functions, in

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.380
your case you can sit

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.260
next to, you are of finance

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.420
and you sit next to marketing,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.500
for example.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.360
Effectively, either next to

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.740
the general manager or next to

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.880
a accounting department, that allows

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.320
you to flow much more the communication

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.260
channel and also the

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.960
collaboration.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.620
In this sense, for example, another

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.340
very clear example of doctrinal

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.540
culture is project management.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.800
Traditionally, companies do a

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.560
management by objectives,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.660
you are in a position and you have

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.340
responsibilities accredited

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.480
to that position.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.680
We have studied when we saw the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.620
different types of organizations,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.140
we saw the functional

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.080
or matrix, you belong to

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.040
sales and your boss is the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.880
sales director.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.760
We now, for example, to be a doctrinal

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.300
organization, what we are doing

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.720
is project management, that is,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.460
you form part of a project where

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.360
there are colleagues First,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.500
an agility in decision-making,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.120
because there are key departments

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.460
that without the need to present

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.960
the project to the management

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560
committee can allow you to

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.000
make a much more operative

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.900
decision.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.520
Basically you don’t block yourself

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.860
because you don’t have to rely

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.260
on another person from another

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.520
department you don’t know, who sees

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.740
you as a stopper, who has no

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.440
implication in the goal of your

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.600
project has to be by your side.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.800
This is what encourages liquid

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.800
organizations, which, for example,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.900
also has another very specific

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.180
case that we have of doctrinal

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.080
culture is job crafting

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.520
that is very related to these

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.120
liquid structures.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.300
What is Job Crafting?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.620
Basically what companies normally

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.440
do is that they go out to look

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.260
for people when they are generated

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.560
a position or another new creation,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.660
they will look for people based

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.580
on a specific position.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.580
We have changed that strategy

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.000
and we focus much more

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.060
on the person and not the position,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.860
so that you go looking for talent

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.380
and that person that makes

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.500
your talent different to the

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.120
company, regardless

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.760
of the position even of

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.880
the department.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.960
This, well, first I congratulate

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.140
you for everything you are doing

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.720
and this job crafting I would

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.880
like you to explain it

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.740
in more detail later.
