00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.330
How has the advent or the breakthrough

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.030
of the digital channel affected the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.750
fashion industry?

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.810
It is a more sales channel that

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.870
can be seen as an opportunity

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.170
for brands, to enhance their

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.590
brand and above all to

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.270
expand internationally.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.750
At the same time, it is a challenge at many levels.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.330
This is a challenge, for example, in terms

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.070
of distribution.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.290
You change the paradigm of where

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.310
you have to have the warehouses.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.810
If you have to have warehouses that are

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.190
close to the customer, therefore it is

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.730
more difficult to consolidate the stock.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.110
Consolidating the stock is relevant

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.090
to not have product flaws or

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.810
size flaws in certain sites.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.610
But of course, how you can get someone

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.770
to serve in 24 hours from a warehouse

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010
you have in another country is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.070
a very big challenge.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.290
So that stock deconsolidation,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.590
I'll try to go a little around

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.090
the supply chain, is one of

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.550
the first points where it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.050
begins to be something disruptive.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.590
Even at product range level

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.190
it also affects you, which actually

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.410
goes a little earlier.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.890
Why is?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.650
Because typically retail has

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.050
a physical limitation as regards

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.110
the number of models that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.510
fit you in certain square meters.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.910
On the internet it is not so.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.490
That's usually a benefit, right?

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.690
Operatively it is not because you

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.790
really have to keep a balance

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.710
between producing a lot of modeling

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.170
and that obviously the customer

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.110
likes.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.590
It's a long tail theory, it's fantastic.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.450
But operational at the cost

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.830
level is not too efficient.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.230
Keep in mind that volume is one

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.850
of the most relevant factors

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.250
when negotiating with a supplier.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.250
And then the level of complexity

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.590
that you need to do instead of making

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.010
2,000 color models, making 4,000

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.850
color models is exponential,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.830
it's an incredible amount

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.550
of work.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.090
Especially in fashion, we are not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.610
talking about consumer products that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.150
are stable in three or four years

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.370
because one model is changed every

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.390
three or four years.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.250
The models are changed every

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.250
six months.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.890
It is a lot of work.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.950
I don't understand making more

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.010
of the same model.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.510
I understand that is an advantage.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.050
At the level of quantity yes, but

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.250
at the level of manufacturing different

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.210
models, which is what I mean with

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.270
a number of different options,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.950
color models, different models.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.630
It is a temptation that can

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.070
be made.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.210
Sometimes online requests.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.450
But it is a dangerous game because

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.050
operatively it may not be profitable.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.470
In terms of design and number

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.370
of clothes, there is already

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.190
some breakdown.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.090
In the logistics and distribution

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.830
sector, as you say, you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.650
need warehouses.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870
And then obviously there is a very

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.870
relevant margin issue.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.870
The online channel has been generated

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.030
with very high standards of

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.530
quality of service, very fast

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.890
deliveries and free returns.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.270
This is a market standard that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.910
is what it is, but that is difficult

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.330
to profit, especially when

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.370
there are very high returns.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.750
Imagine, we are talking about

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.670
levels in the case of Spain,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.250
close to 40% of the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.590
returns, but in more mature

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.730
countries like Germany 60% of

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.250
the returns.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.930
In countries like the United States

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.210
it is around 45%.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.430
This is economically inefficient.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.070
What usually happens is that people

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.370
ask for several sizes of the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.810
same color model, knowing they

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.610
will return some.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.810
Of course, this is fantastic

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.670
for logistics distributors,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.950
but for the industry itself

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.750
it is complicated to manage.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.950
Well, it is there.
