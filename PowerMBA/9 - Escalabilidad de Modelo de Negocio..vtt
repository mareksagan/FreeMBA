00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.960
A business model must be analyzed

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.160
from different perspectives

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.940
and we will go see them, but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.500
today we will talk about scalability,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.620
which is one of the key factors

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.020
to analyze a model and is also

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.040
a concept that is lately in

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.820
the mouth of all because the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.620
scalability of business has

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.300
grown with the arrival

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.760
of the digital economy.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.940
The digital world allows to be much

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.440
more scalable and this is now what they

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.400
are looking for, what a lot of people

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.860
are looking for, what investors are

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.960
looking for, those who are looking

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.260
for entrepreneurs, everyone is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.620
looking for the scalability of a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.260
business, right?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.840
I will explain it to you by example.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800
Let's look at a business that is not

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.260
scalable, for example.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.340
So look, let's talk about, imagine

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.600
a digital marketing agency, it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.560
a company usually of medium

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.940
size, let's think with 10 employees

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.600
that provides services because

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.880
of digital marketing

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.460
and let's think that this

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.220
company wants to grow.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320
Let's see what the scene is.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.300
Well, it may grow, it could

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.540
grow gradually, capture more

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.940
customers, more important customers,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.100
bill more, etc., but its

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.680
costs would always grow more

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.180
or less in a relationship

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.560
with revenue, more or

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.180
less proportionate.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.620
Why is it?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.880
Because it would have to hire more

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.800
employees, first it would have to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.360
hire people who were dedicated

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.460
to capturing more accounts, to generate

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.560
business and then it would have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.860
to hire more employees to provide

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.560
that service because the service

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000
is very leveraged in people,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600
in employees.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.000
And now I put another completely

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.120
different case, that of a super

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.660
scalable business model and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.260
is a mobile game like the Angry

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.240
Birds, for example.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.380
In Angry Birds, the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.860
curve is different.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.260
Rovio, which is the owner

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.480
of Angry Birds, managed

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.680
to brutally multiply its

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.780
sales, while the costs

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.040
were more or less flat.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.400
Why is it?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.340
Because once you had created the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.260
game, you could sell it or you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.620
can sell it to millions more people,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.540
generating millions of dollars

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.840
in additional revenue without

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.460
incurring additional costs

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.180
or incurring very small marginal

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.280
costs.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.820
Is it worth?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.620
That is the key

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.860
to scalability and is the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920
key to Rovio's enormous

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.540
success.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.000
As we have seen in the canvas, we

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.100
have now talked about revenue and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.580
costs and expenses, right?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.860
Scalability is defined

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.780
as the ability to grow

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.280
very fast, with a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.460
growing profitability.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.760
That is, that as you grow

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.940
bigger, your profits will

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.040
be higher.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.300
Well, we've defined scalability

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.800
so far, which is something that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.780
a lot of people know.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.980
You may already know the concept,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.300
but let's start with the really

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.640
interesting part and that is,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.480
let's analyze what are the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.700
factors that make a business

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.020
model scalable.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300
This analysis is very interesting.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.360
Why is it?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.840
Because after doing so, it will allow

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.080
you to create more scalable business

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.660
models, because you already know

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.820
what the real causes are.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400
First, in order for a business

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.600
to be very scalable, it

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.480
has to be, I always say it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.800
has to be in a market that

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.660
allows it, it has to be in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.040
a market large enough.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.800
If you want to grow a lot, your market

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.880
has to be big, because otherwise

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.980
you won't be able to grow.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.060
Big or huge, because if we

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.280
talk about the most valuable companies

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.620
in the world, because the companies

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.220
we always put as an example, such

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.460
as Facebook, for example,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.700
the market of Facebook Ads, the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.700
advertising market in the world is

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.420
immense, of billions of dollars

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.840
or Airbnb, the market of tourist

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.220
accommodation, you can imagine,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.700
or of urban transport, or of

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.440
a real estate portal

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.900
that intermediates in transactions

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.500
of a lot of money.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.640
We're talking about billions,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.180
right?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.260
The main criterion is that your market

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.100
is huge.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.200
If you have a coffee shop, you do not

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.440
go to Second criterion, it is

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.940
that the proposal, your products

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.720
and services are very standardized,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.680
that you can grow, let us put

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.100
an example, globally adapting them

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.280
as little as possible, is it?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.140
I mean standardized.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.340
To grow very quickly, it takes the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.640
product, as I say, to be very

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.240
standardized, for example,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.640
Hawkers glasses.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.340
Well, you can sell the same glasses

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.460
in all countries around the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.820
world, without having to make

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.320
additional investments in product

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.860
adaptation or development.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.720
The Power MBA.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.460
Our program, with the salvation of the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.880
language, which is the only one, creates

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.720
the same value to a person in China,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.000
that in Indonesia, that in Hong

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.900
Kong, that in New York or Peru, is

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.540
it worth?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.960
That is, it is a very standardized

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.100
product and that allows us to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.080
be very scalable.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.760
The mobile app is also another

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.720
clear case.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.540
And I'll give you an example of

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.000
a product that requires more

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480
adaptation and makes it less

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.340
scalable.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.920
Let's think about a accounting software.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.420
The accounting software must take

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.960
into account the legal tax accounting

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.820
regulations of each country.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.940
So if you want to grow in another

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.740
country, you have to adapt your product.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.280
As you can see, this is not a very standardized product.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460
Another factor, the third factor

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.200
for a scalable business

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.200
model, are distribution channels.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.340
This is a distinction between

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.940
the online channel and the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.920
physical channel.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.960
When you can grow online, your

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.060
business is much more scalable.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.140
This is very clear.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.660
If we compare Bars & Noble,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.020
a book retailer with Amazon,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.700
Amazon grew much more than

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.480
Bars & Noble, mainly because

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.820
the digital channel allows

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.060
you to grow around

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.960
the world much faster.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.820
Instead, if your channel is physical,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.680
you have to go establishing

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
new stores, hiring employees,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.960
etc.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.660
Another key factor to consider

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.200
is resources.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.160
They are the key resources

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.040
to lend your business model.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.580
In order for a business to

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.480
be highly scalable, the resources

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.280
and assets on which it is based,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.500
that business model must

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.780
be very scalable too.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.740
Let us look at examples.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.540
If your service or product, if your

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.900
business model requires, is very

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.700
employee-intensive, as we have seen,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.960
for example, before the digital marketing

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.620
agency, it is very complicated

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.740
that you are scalable, because

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.320
you will have to multiply your

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.680
number of employees if you

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.740
multiply your sales volume.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.740
A clear example that also

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.480
disrupts the growth of

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.940
very many companies that depend

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.820
mainly on partners, directors

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.320
or employees for the provision

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.620
of the service.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.760
Or you are dependent on large investments.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.160
We have a hotel chain, for example.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.580
A hotel chain, if it wants to

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.200
grow, has to invest in more hotels.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.660
The curve we have made, the

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.380
profitability will not grow.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.080
You will always get the same margin

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.800
in every place.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.560
Even if it has, there will be

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.980
certain economies of scale if it has

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.820
100 hotels, because it will have

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.660
certain central services, a

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.700
certain structure that covers all

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.440
100 hotels.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.620
And you will have a bit more profitability

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.440
than if you have one.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.180
It is not ultra-scalable.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.280
In contrast, if we compare the hotel

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.400
chain with Airbnb, which can

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.980
be considered a competitor, the

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.160
case of Airbnb, its resource,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.020
the resource on which it is based

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.360
to grow, is a platform, it is

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.520
a platform that serves equally

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.740
anyone around the world.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.940
It is a much more scalable

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.740
resource.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.900
I will give you another example, another

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.720
comparison.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.520
The scalability difference between

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.900
V and a proprietary

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.140
company, for example, of 10 taxis.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.560
Uber, its key resource is the

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.680
platform and the taxi company are

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.500
the taxis, are the vehicles, the

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.280
licenses.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.360
It is clear that Uber's key feature,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.100
its asset, is much more scalable.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.740
The platform, the technology that

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.920
Uber has, the app is much more

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.680
scalable.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.480
It can grow globally without having

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.380
to make additional investments.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.400
Instead, the taxi company every

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.220
time it wants to grow,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.480
it has to buy a new car, get

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.720
a new license and, in addition,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.660
when it has a new employee.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.180
The difference is very clear.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.070
An ultra-scalable business, for

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.610
example, a good example, Hoffman.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.950
Hoffman allows you to get into

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.050
their app and create an album

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.850
from your photos.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.030
They already have the resource that

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.470
is the platform, the technology,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.350
and can grow simply by capturing more

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.050
customers without having

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.770
to incur additional costs

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.810
or investments.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.530
If we compare it with the competitor

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.110
service, it would be a photography

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.350
store that offers you the same,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.830
that is, that from the photographs

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.070
you create an album, because

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.470
it is clear that the resources

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.610
on which Hoffman's business

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.890
model is based are much more

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.290
scalable than its traditional

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.390
competitor.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.470
Well, as we have seen, scalability

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.710
is one of the key or most

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.350
important features of a business

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.610
model, something we have to

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.550
take into account, because highly

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.590
scalable are very valuable,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.810
everyone is looking for scalable

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.410
and we have analyzed it from

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.830
the perspective of the business

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.290
model canvas and we have identified

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.590
that in addition to revenue

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.530
and costs, which is the obvious,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.790
there are a number of factors

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.290
that make a business, a business

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.350
model more scalable, that your

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.450
market is very large, that your

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.650
proposal is very standardized,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.570
that online sales, that your

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.710
distribution channel allows

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.810
you to grow very quickly

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.090
and finally, that you are supporting

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.990
in key resources that are

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.610
scalable, that you do

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.090
not have to permanently

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.090
make additional investments.
