00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.690
Izanabe, let’s look at how the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.070
funding went, the different

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.430
rounds you had in Onavox.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.770
First tell us how they went sequentially,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.830
how much money went in, what

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.130
kind of investors went

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.830
in, and so on.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.890
We are therefore reinforcing a little more

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.630
what we have learned.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.930
And then what we’re going to do is an

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.230
analysis of the mistakes or the things

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.670
you would change a posteriori.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.130
It is worth, then, the first round

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.190
we raised at Onavox, which is a little

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.590
exceptional, because we raised

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.570
a round like that of 40,000 euros

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.870
before we had anything.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.310
That is, it was 40,000 euros on

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.890
PowerPoint, but it is also true

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.390
that the team that we assembled

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.030
it and I had done exactly the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.850
same thing in another market,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.070
in the market of cosmetics

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.290
for Rocket Internet.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.690
Then the proposal was eye, we

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.130
just did this, we just launched

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.110
this for Rocket Internet in

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.270
the cosmetics sector and we’

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.670
re going to do the same in another

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.230
sector that’s more promising.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.770
Yes, I think it’s very good to clarify

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.350
that, because after all the times

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.670
we’ve repeated that you can’t go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010
to a professional investor on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.750
the zero day.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.130
justly.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.270
All you got is because you had

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.390
a trajectory, you were in the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.910
sector, you were known by investors

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.890
and you were moving a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.130
model that worked in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.310
the industry.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.430
Just go to something in addition

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.710
to what we were just doing, that we

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.490
were doing at that time and with

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.390
demonstrable, clear results.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.490
That is, the incognitoes of skill

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.990
and momentum were more cleared

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.350
and the team’s capabilities.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.790
That is, it was not possible to see how

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.810
this business model was transferred

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.570
to another sector, but in that case

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.270
the investor considered that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.530
that investment of 40,000 euros

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.170
was worthwhile to clear that incognito.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.330
These 40,000 euros were given

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.970
to us by Cavietes & Partners

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.410
in November 2011 so that we

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.770
can be able to launch a website,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.630
fill the first 5,000 boxes and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.250
get the first customers.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.150
We have three months to do this.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.830
We have spent 40,000 euros...

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.710
A small mistake, but we spent

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.390
20,000 euros on a website, which

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.530
then cost us a lot more, but

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.470
well, that’s another story.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.750
And the other 20,000 euros we spend

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.650
on buying the first 5,000 boxes,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.190
because one of the things you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.610
find when you are very small,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.790
you are a startup that sometimes

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.370
needs very small amounts

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.730
of things and you find yourself

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.830
with a supplier the minimum

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.290
order is 5,000 boxes.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.630
That has changed a little, but well.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.290
And the founders asked for a personal

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170
loan of 20,000 euros more, so that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.590
we could survive those three

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.290
months and pay the salaries

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.370
of the small team we had.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.690
But let’s, we mount it from the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.750
home lounge, total startup history,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.210
working every hour of the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.850
day.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.910
It arrives March 2012 and we

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.930
have fulfilled what we had

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.390
committed, we launched the web,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.930
filled the first 5,000 boxes, got

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.090
the first customers, fulfilled

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.790
what we had promised and gave

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.690
us 110,000 euros.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.950
The goal of those 110,000 euros is to

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.970
start incorporating a little bit of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.850
equipment and validate that we

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.770
are able to start capturing more customers.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.390
Beyond those first 15 customers

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.570
we had achieved with a lot

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.890
of illusion the first month.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.010
To what values?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.510
Let’s take a little picture.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.510
What assessments at that time?

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.030
What percentage have you been?

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.970
How did you know that what came

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.070
in was a venture capital?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.830
It has entered a very...

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.930
Cavities & Partners is a mix.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.290
That is, it’s a bit weird because

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.510
it’s venture capital, but it’s also

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.230
a lot in the business angel sit phase.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.410
I feel like a business angel.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.530
He is a business angel with pockets

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.090
deep enough to accompany

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.150
afterwards to rounds.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.890
It’s more business angel.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.670
Yes, it’s more business angel, but

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.590
then it can get you rounded a lot more.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.210
You can participate in the sector.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.430
In the first round, that round

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.150
sit, those 40,000 euros entered a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.370
valuation of half a million euros

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.710
because basically following a little

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.930
of the sector standard, well,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.890
because we gave that first 20%

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.250
that also entered as a convertible note.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.210
That is, it was a participatory

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.410
loan that became capital

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.710
when those 110,000 euros

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.190
entered.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.990
To what evaluation?

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.730
Now I don’t know how to say, I don’

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.450
t remember, but it has already

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.790
risen quite a bit because you realize

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.910
that this was in March and in July

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.350
of that same year, half a million

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.330
euros more came in.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.750
That half a million euros more entered

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.210
already the Bertelsmann group,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.710
BDMI, which are Germans, and entered

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.110
Ichfan, which is an Italian incubator,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.350
which were then like the two local

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.890
parnes that we had to launch

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.590
then Italy and Germany.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.050
And these put 250 each more and

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.550
there was a little discompaniment

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.230
to not dilute after that round

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.690
that he had made of 110,000.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.850
This round did not become a series,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.530
but it is true that it was money

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.510
already intended to start with

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.350
international expansion.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.890
This was in July, in March of

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.730
the following year, in March 2013,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.190
Kibo Ventus entered and put, they

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.450
put all the investors we had

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.310
to not dilute and in that round

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.190
entered 750,000 euros.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.270
That 750,000 euros was to open the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.830
markets of France and the UK and to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.790
continue validating the capture channels,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.610
because as we saw in the previous

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.950
class, we did the things a

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.210
little bit in the reverse.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.050
Before we validated the capture

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.470
channels, we started to internationalize

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.850
and when we were already

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.870
internationalized, it was when

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.930
we started to do that process.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.550
And that was the last big round we had.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.490
To what evaluation?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.130
That round was already 10 million valuation.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.150
That was the last one, 10 million per coin.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.390
That was the last big round

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.950
because from there it was when

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.530
with that money we validated the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.630
capture channels, we achieved

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.010
some good metrics of the

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.530
metrics we commented, of

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.790
a CPA of 15 euros and a costumer

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.750
live value of 120 euros.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.330
In addition, as we were able to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.550
recover investment in the month

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.070
two, that level of cash flows.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.490
The crack payback was two months.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.330
Two months, both it’s at the level of

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.630
cash flow, it was as very interesting,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.750
it was very good.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.730
What problem did we have?

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.010
We already had a high

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.010
rating.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.310
And, of course, when you were going

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.810
to talk to investors, you said, but

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.850
how long does this project take?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.090
No, it’s that we’ve been two years

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.130
and peak and you saw the

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.290
growth curve and it was very

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.690
slow, because we’ve discovered

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.070
the growth levers very late.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.710
Then, that penalized us very

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.690
much and from there we went

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.290
raising as survival rounds

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.150
of 250 thousand, we got an

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.790
Enisa 300 thousand, another

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.430
round of 200 thousand.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.930
But we never get up again.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.110
Did you burn a lot of money?

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.310
Not at the time, but

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.210
we were burning.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.110
That is, at that time we were burning

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.850
15, 20, which is not much, that

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.450
is, this is heard by someone from

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.830
the traditional sector and hands

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.570
on the head.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.430
But in the startup world it is not much.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.650
That is, in the startup world burning

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.550
15, 20 thousand is not too much

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.770
when you have good marketing metrics.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.630
Yes, it is nothing.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.090
What was the problem?

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.990
That that money, that those rounds

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.310
that were already coming in, 80%

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.130
went to survive, not to invest in

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.630
marketing.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.230
So we enter a little bit of a vicious

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.830
circle of what do I do?

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.650
Do I spend this money on capture or do

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.430
I spend it on paying the salaries and

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.170
having three more months?

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.650
Do you know?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.770
In surviving three months more or

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.950
we bet everything at once and put it

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.070
all in marketing.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.850
I understand that it is part of the

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.470
international structure, right?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.730
At that time we had already brought

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.590
back the entire structure in

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.990
Spain.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.190
Then we had a team of 36 people

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.030
in Spain, 11 nationalities,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.570
those were the United Nations,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.710
and that was our main

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.410
cost.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.270
Because at the end of the day what we

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.050
sold, the brands gave us the products

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.750
without cost, we had a cost of logistics,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.970
but well, it was residual.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.130
Here if we do the analysis of

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.390
the margin you are getting to each

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.250
of the customers, right?

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.170
The cost of acquiring customers

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.750
goes well and that’s the

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.650
gross margin, to say

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.030
somehow.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.410
Of course, then the gross margin has

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.590
to cover the fixed costs.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.110
and exact.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.150
As far as I can see, I couldn’t cover them.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.590
We didn’t even break up.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.190
We didn’t get to Break Even because

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.510
it was an interesting situation.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.710
Spain, Austria, France and Germany

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.270
were in Break Even, they were profitable

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.470
countries, but we had Italy

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.010
and the United Kingdom, which for

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.910
different reasons that I tell

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.710
you now, were those who were generating

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.070
that capital drainage and that

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.290
burning of the monthly cash

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.950
of 15,000, 20,000 euros.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.390
Italy, because the criterion for

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.910
opening Italy was because we had an

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.910
investor from Italy and gave us

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.210
money to open it.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.790
That this is one of the advice that they

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.890
always give you, that they gave me too

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.970
and that I did not apply, I hear, because

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.930
they give you money you do not

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.750
have to take it.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.130
You also have to have a strategic

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.570
vision of what you want the money

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.550
to do and what you’re going to

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.170
use it for.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.010
And the mistake we made here is that

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.270
a gentleman from Italy came in and

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.970
said I give you 250,000 euros to open

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.870
Italy and we chose it and we opened

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.910
Italy and already.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.390
And then we realized that Italy,

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.550
at that time, was not a country

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.690
at all interesting for an e-commerce.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.050
Because the broadband internet

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.090
was a very small segment and

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.210
online credit card payment was

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.310
even smaller.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.750
Given that our market was super

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.170
small because they were pregnant

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.770
and moms who bought online

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.310
and had a middle-high

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.450
purchasing level, that

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.290
is, our Italian market was

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.530
like that.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.550
But we were spending a lot

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.110
of money on it and in the

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.330
UK it was the opposite.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.870
The United Kingdom was the same as Spain is now.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.110
To get an idea, a

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.310
lit in Spain cost

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.730
us 40 cents.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.410
In the UK it cost us £3.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.370
Having an effective and efficient

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.370
marketing strategy in the UK

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.350
cost us a lot of money we didn’t have.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.690
That’s because the capture

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.010
channels are more mature or

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.830
more saturated.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.270
and exact.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.870
The UK at that time was in

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.750
the phase that is now Spain

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.150
in which startups already

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.250
make television.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.770
Either you are on TV or you are not.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.390
Then there were two markets that one because

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.750
it was very expensive and the other because

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.610
it was very small.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.670
We were draining and they were

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.310
causing us that cost of 15,000

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.210
20,000 euros a month of

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.410
burning the box.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.270
The question is why did you

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.750
not close the UK and Italy and

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.950
stay with the viable market.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.430
Here what happened was that as we

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.170
have seen in the class of financing

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.290
the investors of this type of

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.570
investors these venture capital funds

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.470
invest in projects in which they

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.770
can make one for 10 because

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.710
the risk of the rest of the

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.910
products in which they invest

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.450
is so high that you have to

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.130
get out well one in every 10 but

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.710
a box closed Italy and closed UK.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.710
It lost European leadership and the

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.990
scenario in which it could be

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.870
sold for 100 million that was the

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.210
10 percent of that 10 million

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.310
valuation that we had at that

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.250
time without having open the

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.970
markets of Italy and the UK was

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.170
minimal.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.090
It was a very unlikely scenario.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.210
This is a clear case of how a business

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.930
that could have been sustainable,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.230
feasible, viable.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.870
The way to finance it or the

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.690
system ended up corrupting it

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.770
because you made a valuation at 10

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.830
million that was too high,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.850
funds entered and you were already

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.150
forced to follow a strategy that

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.410
you knew, surely, that was mad

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.050
because you were trying to grow in

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.530
countries that were absolutely

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.630
lastering your accounts,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.990
that if you were your business

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.630
and you had not depended on anyone,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.550
you would have chopped Italy, you

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.670
would have chopped the UK and

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.250
you would have your business

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.030
profitable paying 30, 40

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.150
salaries, etc., but you were

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
forced to grow bestially because

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.270
it had to be worth

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.070
100 million.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.310
Just, it’s that my job as CEO until

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.490
almost the end, in the last few

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.590
months, my job as CEO was to

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.870
increase the company’s valuation,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.950
not increase its revenue.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.790
The strategies you follow and

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.450
the decisions you make are

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.210
very different.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.790
I worked for if I had to

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.910
have good metrics, I had to

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.890
have a good customer life

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.330
value, but always to the extent

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.030
that I allowed to raise more

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.910
investors.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.850
Don’t raise more money, not

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.270
just raise more money,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.090
if you actually raise money

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.010
to higher ratings.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.830
Bigger, of course, because in

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.610
the end our goal was to sell

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.090
for 100 million euros when an

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.790
American giant came and

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.690
came to Europe, to be attractive

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.010
enough for that giant who came

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.670
to buy us or for a Unilever

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.630
or a Procter & Gamber or

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.650
someone who interested him.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.890
So, until almost the end, my

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.250
job as CEO was to increase

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.590
valuation, not increase revenue.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.210
That is why the decision to

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.870
keep open and to keep both the

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.630
UK and Italy.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.970
And it was forcing you, as

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.310
we were saying, to make

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.110
decisions from a strategic and

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.830
common sense point of view.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.610
of contradictions.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.210
The nefasts, who at the end end ended up...

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.470
They were stealing the company’

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.210
s accounts.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:08.810
justly.
