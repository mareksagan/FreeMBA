00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.200
One of the basic perspectives

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.460
of financial statements analysis,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.040
basically one of the most important

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.740
analyses that is always done

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.340
is the margin, the margin

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.640
on sales.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.780
Whenever you talk about a business,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.260
it's one of the first things

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.120
that comes to your mind.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.000
What is the margin?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.700
Let us define the concept.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
What is the margin?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.740
The margin is the percentage of sales

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.700
that is converted into profit.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.220
As we will see, there are different

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.880
sizes of margin.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.420
Why is it so interesting?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.320
Well, because it is a very interesting

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.660
analysis because in addition to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.200
that it is very relatively easy

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700
to do, it provides us with

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.260
quite valuable information and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.220
I will put an example that is too

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.940
simplistic, but we will put ourselves

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.840
in the situation that they talk

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500
about a business that has a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
margin of 45%, that is, 45%

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.940
of sales become avoidable.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.900
It is a fact that at first is very

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.720
representative of being a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.940
very healthy business, that

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.940
they are probably doing things

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.920
very well, have a strong competitive

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.480
advantage or are very cost

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.560
efficient, etc.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.160
With this in mind, the business

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.680
is quite interesting.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.760
Let's see how the margin is calculated.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.240
I agree with the results.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.720
Remember that there are different

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.900
sizes of benefits.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.600
As we go down and we are resting

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.780
different spending parts,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.800
the results state informs us of

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.220
different magnitudes, which

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.420
have different meanings.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.460
Above we have the gross margin

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.060
in which only what we have

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.800
deducted is the cost of sales.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.660
We go down and we deduct

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.800
structural expenses like personnel

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.220
and other expenses and

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.740
we have the avoid.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.700
If the deduction is also the amortization,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.600
we have the evit.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960
Remember that the avoid and the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.740
avoid are the magnitude of profit

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.200
that inform us of the operating

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.520
profit, of what are the results

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.140
of the operational activity,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.940
of the economic activity

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
of the company, regardless

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.300
of how you have been financed.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.640
Because if we continue to go down

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.200
and cut interest on the debt,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.160
what we have is the gross

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.960
profit.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.560
We have already considered

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.140
what it is, what our financial

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.440
structure is.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.260
If we also pay the tax,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.220
we have the result.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.680
Perfect, for now what we're going

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.260
to do, what we can do is calculate

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.740
the margin for each of those

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.620
magnitudes.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320
We have the gross margin that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.440
we divide the gross margin between

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.480
sales, the margin avoids, the margin

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.440
avoids between sales, the margin avoids

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.460
and finally the net margin.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.120
By the way, I want you to keep in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.400
mind one thing, remember this concept,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.060
is to normalize.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.820
I mean normalization.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.680
Imagine that we are comparing two

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.080
companies and we are comparing the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.860
avoid margin of two companies in a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.100
particular year.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.200
In many cases, it is possible

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.840
that seasonal or punctual

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.880
circumstances cause us to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.640
compare pears with apples.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.180
Why is?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.100
Imagine that one of the companies

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.180
for a year has had to face

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.320
a very high cost of dismissals,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.740
because it has had to affect

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.020
the margin avoids.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.920
Therefore, we must make an

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.760
effort to identify all those

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760
effects that are punctual

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.200
and are not directly,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.880
not sustainable,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.920
not directly related

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.120
to the activity of

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.920
the company.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.540
You already know what are

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.120
the magnitudes of margin, gross

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.740
margin, avoid margin, avoid margin,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.000
net margin and now the question

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.460
is, which one will be used

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.620
in one case or another?

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.960
There is no direct answer to

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.600
that.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.620
It is important that you understand

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.820
well that each of them informs

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.780
us and apply it to the different

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.560
analyses based on the sector

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.740
we are analyzing, the business

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.780
we are analyzing.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.920
I will give you an example.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.220
We think we're looking at a clothing

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.580
store.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.420
How does a clothing store work?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.900
very simple though.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.560
Buy a commodity that is clothing

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.880
and sell it back and apply a markup,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.100
that is, imagine that you buy

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.460
the commodity and apply it

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.340
and sell it back for two, two and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.040
a half or three times more than

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.120
you bought it.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.340
And with that it generates a gross

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.420
margin and with that gross margin

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.580
it has to pay the costs that are

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.800
lower in the result account such

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.960
as the structure costs of the rental

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.560
of the local and the costs

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.140
of the salaries and salaries

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.660
of employees.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.460
So what margin or ratio would

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.660
a store analyze?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.880
I would analyze the margin.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.180
It is very important because the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.140
costs in every store and here where

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.480
it is played, where is it?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.700
In that markup, in the ability

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.080
to apply a margin to all the sales

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.000
you're doing, in addition to the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.400
rotation of the goods, that's another

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.500
topic that we'll analyze

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.520
in another class.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.380
Or let's think, for example, of a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.060
business like Tulotero.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.580
In a business like Tulotero

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.620
is also very interesting at gross

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.600
margin.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.660
You think that in any marketplace

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.840
you trade a lot of millions

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.500
and the goal of the marketplace

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.560
is, on that money that

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.620
is traded, to stay as

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.700
much as possible.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.460
Maximise the gross margin.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.980
Why is?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.180
The cost structure below

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.540
is very low.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.160
Operational leverage, which is a concept

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.280
that we will analyze in another

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.440
class, is very high.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.880
The structure costs weigh

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.620
little and basically what you

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.980
have to do is maximize the gross

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.540
margin and each percentage

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.860
point you increase, keep in mind

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.020
that many millions are transacted,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.760
because it has a huge impact.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.880
If we think, for example, in

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.860
EBITDA margin or in industry, it

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860
is a different case than those we

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860
have analyzed so far.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.780
Here it is very important and have

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.160
an enormous weight the costs of

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.800
staff structure, the amortisation

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.860
of all the unmobilized,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860
of all the machinery

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.280
that the company has.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.260
So in this case, the gross

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.640
margin may inform us less, we

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.540
have to go lower, we have

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.540
to go to the EBITDA margin

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.300
or maybe better to the EBIT

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.040
margin.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.160
And so we also have in mind the

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.140
amortization of all those unmobilized.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.420
As you see the goal, you understand

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.580
well what each of the magnitudes

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.500
are, you understand well what each

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.680
of the margin radials informs us

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.380
and that when you analyze a

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.720
business you always take into account

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.980
the margin and be able to identify

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.540
which of them provides us with

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.360
really valuable information

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.700
for analysis.
