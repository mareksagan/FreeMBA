00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.980
Traditional management

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.320
is no longer effective.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.880
The companies ultimately do

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.880
is project management and for

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.560
that what has been left

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.960
out are specialists profiles.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.340
You are no longer part of a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.040
function, you are already part of

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.820
a project where people from other

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.380
departments are and you have

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.460
to have knowledge of those departments.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.600
You have to have knowledge of

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.860
finance, marketing, marketing,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.980
strategy because then your

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.080
added value for the company

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.360
will be much greater than if

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.360
you were to be a mere specialist.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.240
Because in the end the impact that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.560
a specialist has is already

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.100
completely out of date and is null,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420
however if you develop your

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.680
holistic profile the added value

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.640
you bring to a company is infinitely

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.560
greater than that that a specialist

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.900
provides.
