00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.780
Companies and small have never

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.680
taken into account the assessment.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.340


00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.100
And if you talk to your friends or people

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.560
you know who are entrepreneurs,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.500
but from a non-startup environment, they

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
don't usually think about how much

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.020
their company is worth.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Think about how much you earn a year, etc.,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.420
or how much you're going to grow.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.660
But not in the assessment.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920
In our world, however, we

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.520
talk about valuation every day.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.520
every day.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.680
It is a word that always comes out.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.180
Why is?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.720
I would say for two reasons.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.080
One, because the goal of many people

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.380
is to sell the company.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.440
That is, they are not thinking only about

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.980
what they earn each year but about success,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.020
how much money they are going to sell

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.640
their company.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.080
And two, because when you need to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.200
finance yourself with private capital,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.320
for the investor the valuation is very

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.860
important.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.320
And that's why I think

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.240
it's very important that our

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.360
students understand how this

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.260
works in companies of this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.700
type.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.620
The first thing I would like you to

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.860
explain to us is from what mechanisms,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.600
and I will not talk about valuation

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.660
methods because that is, from

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.720
what mechanisms the price

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.300
is fixed.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
It is worth, obviously, as

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.880
Borja advanced, the values of

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.060
traditional companies

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.540
do not apply in the startup

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.220
world.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.800
And they do not apply in the startup

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.240
world first because they are

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.600
valuation methods that are based

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.780
on billing, on cash flow

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.420
discounts.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.360
And in startups in many cases,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.360
the turnover is not one of the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.740
main metrics and the scalability

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.480
or exponentiality that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.100
the business can come to have

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.820
is valued.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.980
The expectations, right?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.500
Exactly, that is, at the end of the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.640
day what is valued is, hear, how

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.460
far this will grow and how much

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.820
we will be able to sell it.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.840
Then, another peculiarity

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.380
of startups is that if I have a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.100
traditional business and want

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.560
to finance it, then I ask for a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.240
loan from a bank, for example,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.760
but that bank will not ask me

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.420
for equity in exchange for money.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.960
But in the world of startups,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.940
selling pieces of our percentage

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.320
of the company is something

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.340
very common.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.580
So, that valuation is something

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.440
we must always have in mind

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.220
and that we must know.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.720
In some cases, and this would be

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
a bad practice, sometimes we get

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.320
to matter more valuation than

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.000
billing and what sometimes leads

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.140
us to behaviors a bit short-placist.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.020
That is, that is true, there are

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.860
many managers, CEOs of startups, if they

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.740
only think about the valuation they

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.460
can end up addicting to the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.680
management of the company, why?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.940
And that is very unhealthy.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.480
and exact.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.320
Because in the end you have

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.940
to think about creating value

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.900
for your customers, that the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.280
company creates value for your

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.200
customers internally, etc.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460
Investor value creation is

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.920
valuation, as it is important

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.260
too, but it must be a consequence

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.160
of value creation

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.260
in the market.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.540
If there are managers who think

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240
only about inflating that

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.980
valuation, but are neglecting the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.840
creation of value to the customer,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080
because that is untenable.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.100
It is not sustainable.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.180
When you do things well and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.080
have a good product that sells

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.620
alone and a great market, rating

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.160
will always accompany.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.820
You will get a good assessment that

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.640
will accompany you.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.420
Many people ask, how do I calculate my assessment?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.580
I compare myself to other startups, there

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.920
is some table, there is some way.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.120
It is more than a deductive process, it

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.000
is an inductive process.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.060
In the end the way to calculate

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.040
the valuation is how much money

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.260
I need at this stage, depending on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.460
the stage in which I am, what

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.980
we saw in two previous

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.000
classes, why I need the money,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.600
how much money I need and what

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.860
percentage of my business I am willing

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.800
to give to an investor at

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.300
this time.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.020
And that's what will lead us to calculate

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.920
the valuation that we will then

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.680
cross with also the expectations

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.860
of investors.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.340
As in any market, there is supply

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.160
and demand.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.200
What happens is that the offer, as

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.820
you explain well, the offer is, I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.360
am the owner of the company and

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.240
in this first phase I need 100,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.080
000 euros.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.040
And I'm willing to share 20%

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.600
of my company, for example.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.800
So my company has to be worth

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.120
half a million euros.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.940
But of course, if you go out to the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.840
market and that's stupid, because

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.820
someone has to buy it to you, someone

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.400
has to believe you.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.660
Then the investor will make his calculations

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.460
as well.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.860
And in the balance it is like

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.080
any, if you want to sell a house

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.380
of 90 square meters for five

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.500
million euros, when it doesn'

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.240
t work, because there will

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.920
be no buyer.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.240
And we're back to what we

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.660
explained in previous classes that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.440
investors have expectations of

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760
making one in 10 or one in 20

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.900
of their investment.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.540
So for them the money, the valuation

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.300
to which they enter a company is

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.480
very important because on that basis

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.240
they will calculate how much

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.360
this company can be sold

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.300
or even how much it can increase

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.220
the valuation.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.860
Because another thing that is sometimes

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.400
given is that investors who enter

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.740
early stages, in upper rounds,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.380
instead of accompanying themselves

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.700
can go out and sell their

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.780
stocks, which would be another option.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.220
At the end of the day, the investor

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.360
will also have to pay the bills.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.560
Then you can need 200,000 euros now

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200
and be willing to give a 5%, but

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.880
as Borja said, if there is no

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.940
fit in the market, there are

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.020
no investors who believe that

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.140
they can get enough profitability

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.140
to that percentage,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.060
you will not sell it.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.780
To explain it in such a very simple

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.180
way, it could be the mechanism of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.460
fixing the price or the final valuation

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.500
to which the investor ends up

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.340
entering that would be something

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.620
like the founders of the startup

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.080
determine how much they need.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.560
They determine the percentage

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.840
that they are willing to share.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.400
That is the supply and then comes the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.720
demand and it is the investor and says,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.500
you have valued your company in

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.260
half a million euros.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.180
I think this can be valid for a reasonable

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.480
period of time, that is, in a

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480
few years, because he has no intention

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.460
of being with you all his

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.920
life.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.840
I think this can be worth 10 times

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.580
more than this company that has

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.080
just been born, for example, that

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.860
you have valued it in half a million

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.380
euros can end up worth 5 million.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.260
If that is reasonable for the investor,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.320
you will come to an agreement

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.040
with him.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.040
Basically is.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.660
That is.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.720
Then within the assessment there

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720
would be four tips that can

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.860
help us a little to make these

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.880
messes between supply and demand

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.380
with a little sense.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.420
One of the biggest mistakes

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.640
you can make is not getting

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.760
enough money.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.540
That is, sometimes there is

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.960
a type of entrepreneur that is

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.860
called Gollum and Gollum is the

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.600
one who clings to his percentage

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.000
of no, no, I am that I want to

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.600
have 80 or 90 percent of my

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.620
company and I am not willing

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.540
to give up.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.180
And here's a question that's

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.240
worth asking, what's worth more?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.040
90% of something worth 100,000

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.680
euros or 20% of something worth 20 million.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.080
So, taking that into account and also

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.260
taking into account that the partners'

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.980
pact that will be seen in other

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.080
classes, in a startup, having or

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.940
not having the majority of shares

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.800
does not determine the freedom you

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.980
will have of management.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.480
Freedom of management is marked

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.100
by a partnership pact in which

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.940
you have the same freedoms

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.120
when you have 90% of your company

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.080
than when you have 10%.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.560
So, clinging to the percentages

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.160
is sometimes a bit absurd.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.360
The first mistake is not investing enough.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.260
In many cases motivated, as you said,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.620
by that obsession with accaparing

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.580
or keeping the largest percentage

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.960
of equity possible.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.340
That, eye, the more equity you have,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.060
the better.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.840
But it is that you have to

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.140
be realistic and you have to start

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.120
first from what you need to grow

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.700
and starting from that, that money,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.680
like what you have explained,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.760
starting from the amount

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.000
you need to make your business

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.300
model end up having meaning,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.740
because to give up the percentage...

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.940
Within that, give as little percentage

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.940
as possible, but it is that you

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.200
have to square the investor.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.240
and exact.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.600
Another mistake you can make,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.860
which is also quite common,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.980
is raising too much money.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.160
It is a advice that gives a lot

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.760
of raising only the money you

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.360
need, but it is also true that

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.960
when one is in the process of raising

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.220
a round of funding, if

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.140
we have a project that is

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.160
very attractive, which wastes

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.780
a lot of interest among investors,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.000
you can give the case that

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.780
suddenly they offer us more

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.260
money than we had thought

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.820
at first.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.400
And in those circumstances, knowing

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.700
how to say no, I only need 200,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.720
000 or 250,000 euros to get

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.920
the next goal when they are offering

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.700
you more, it is difficult because

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.340
then there is the adage of

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.180
more worth a bird in hand that

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.960
I feel flying.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.040
If I get it, I'll stay

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.080
there and see in a year.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.840
This type of attitude, which is very

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.220
complicated when you see yourself inside

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.940
them, of saying no, can penalize

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.180
you for a future because the

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.140
sooner you take the money, the

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.820
less valuations you are taking it.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.040
The ideal thing would be to catch

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.820
the least money possible at

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.420
low ratings, quickly demonstrate

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.260
with that money the next steps

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.500
and validate your idea, go catch

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.620
money but always the least

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.560
possible to demonstrate the next step.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.660
This fits well with what we have seen

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.240
in several classes, which is that you

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.620
have to take the right steps and you

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.400
do not have to jump.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.640
When we talked about the phases of

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.440
business growth, if you have not

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.880
reached product market fit or if you

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.020
have not validated your growth channels,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.300
distribution, if you have not

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.560
validated where you can grow and

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.140
suddenly you are injected 5 million,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.900
we when we have been in similar

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.460
circumstances in which you ask

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.520
how much money you need,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.520
there is a question that I think

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.220
is very useful and that

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.900
you have to do.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.980
If I had 5 million euros

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.660
in my account today,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.380
would you know what I

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.380
would spend these 5 million

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.500
euros in an optimal

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.220
way?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.260
If you haven't validated the channels,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.340
it's that those 5 million don't

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.680
know what to do with them and then

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.960
what you start doing is barbarism.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.680
It is, and that is the key.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.900
You said it is best to spend

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.680
it.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.820
In the end, lack of money wakes

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.660
up creativity and if I don't have

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.340
money I'll look for the most

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.040
efficient ways to validate things,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.100
the fastest and most effective ways

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.160
and when we have a lot of money

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.420
we relax, we start spending

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.780
money on superfluous things

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.740
and it's easier that we

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.080
lose focus.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.640
That's, but when things are done

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.220
well, it's all very easy, that is,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.900
when you have taken the steps

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.960
and you know you can grow in a certain

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.300
market because you validated it,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.300
at that moment you get those

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.460
5 million euros injected, I'm talking

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.920
about fictitious amounts,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.000
you're investing those 5 million

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.280
and you're wishing to be invested

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.260
because the next day you

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.620
know what to do with them.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.960
And you know what profit they will

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.660
generate, you know what they will

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.920
return you more or less because you have

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.100
validated it, but if those 5 million

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.800
invest you before, because you don'

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.660
t know what to do with it, change

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.940
the office furniture, I don't know

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.660
what you do, but in the end you waste it.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.380
Basically is.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.840
Then two other tips, now we gave

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.340
two tips of what happens if I

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.100
raise very little money or if I

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.940
raise a lot of money, the

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.320
following would be related to the

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.140
valuation.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.920
Why is one of the mistakes that

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.220
can be made to raise money at

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.920
very low valuations?

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.900
As we will see later when we talk

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.200
about dilution, if I raise money

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.900
to very low valuations, I am leaving

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.340
little space for more money,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.680
more funding to enter and I come

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.240
as an entrepreneur to the exit of

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.960
the company or to the exit of the

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.060
stock market with a percentage

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.360
that is able to keep

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.320
me motivated.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.960
Basically you are losing too much

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.260
of your business and as you

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.100
will have to continue funding,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.360
there will be a day when

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.280
you don't spend anything.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.560
It is no longer attractive to investors.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.440
It may seem counterproductive, counterintuitive,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.760
but the investor wants to buy

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.020
as cheaply as possible to

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.280
a point, because the investor

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.400
is also interested in keeping

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.580
yourself motivated.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.060
And then another mistake that

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.440
can be made is raising money

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.300
at too high valuations.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.740
And this, although it may seem like a lie,

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.740
is a fairly common mistake.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.460
Sometimes if I get to raise

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.360
money to too high valuations,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.520
along with those valuations,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.720
expectations also come.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.260
And when these expectations are

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.560
too high and not met, you're

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.080
committing yourself to the next

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.640
round, because if you don't meet

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.940
those expectations, raising

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.840
the next money you need to

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.620
survive can become almost

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.240
impossible.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.180
I think that's not a problem

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.880
if you don't need more money.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.680
If you do not need more money, you

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.640
will not need more money, that

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.160
you can not know this as a certain

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.800
science, but if you will not

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.180
need more, the higher the rating,

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.720
the more my company was

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.080
worth, I dilute less,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.280
etc., all happy.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.300
But of course, if you will have to do

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.960
another round in two years, because

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.820
for the next milestone you need

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.220
another X million and you have over-

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.220
sold your project, and two years

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.800
later you are not able to prove that

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.860
you have created value during

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.440
those two years, because you see yourself

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.920
in a very complex situation.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.220
Very complex, because not only does

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.220
not house the new valuation you

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.380
have, which is the post-evaluation

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.420
of the previous plus a little bit,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.060
with the results you have, but

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.460
to convince the board of

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.460
management you already have, the

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.160
investors you already have, who

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.260
have to lose value on the paper

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.200
and make a round to a lower valuation

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.520
than they entered two years

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.520
ago, is almost impossible.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.120
You have seen yourself in that situation.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.520
I will tell you.
