00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.080
The DAFO is a strategic diagnostic

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.100
tool, which allows us to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.580
analyze what our current

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.280
situation is to make decisions

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.200
afterwards.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.020
Well, there is a model in which

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.420
it is established, we determine

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.200
four strategies based on the conclusions

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
of the DAFO.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.320
We don't say that you should apply

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.680
this to raja table, but it helps

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.640
you understand a little, after you

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640
have done the DAFO, it helps you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.840
do a little deeper analysis and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.220
understand where you should

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.800
go or what it should be, what

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.560
the general lines of your

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.140
strategy are.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.680
Let's go to the first case.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.320
Imagine that you are in

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.020
a situation where you have many

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.220
strengths and there are many

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.880
external opportunities.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.280
In such a situation, what do

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.000
you have to do?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.600
Well, you have to be very

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
aggressive, you have to have an

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.420
offensive strategy, you have to capitalize

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.920
or support yourself or balance

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.600
up on those strengths to take

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.960
advantage of all the opportunities

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.820
that are on the market,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.680
invest strongly, grow,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.800
etc.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.420
We will think now that we have many

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.160
strengths over competitors, we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.880
have competitive advantages,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.040
good product, etc., but it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.220
turns out that the market,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.640
the environment, come quite

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.780
a few threats.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.780
We will encounter many threats,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.020
so in this case, what

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.060
do we have to do?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.240
Well, in such a situation you don't

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.080
have to be so aggressive, we have

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.800
to have a more prudent strategy,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.480
a defensive strategy.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.420
We can get through the storm,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.780
why?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.700
Because we have those strengths,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.660
but what doesn't seem like in

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.520
such a situation, when the market

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.140
won't be thanked, etc., what doesn't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.080
seem prudent is to invest

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.640
so strongly, is to be so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.520
aggressive.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.660
Now we think we are in the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.460
opposite situation.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.180
We have, the market seems or

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.380
the sector presents

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.960
itself in opportunities, it

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.480
will be able to grow, demand

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.440
will grow, etc., however, we

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.580
have many internal weaknesses

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.420
and in this case what we have

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.160
to do is to make an adaptation

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.080
or reorientation strategy.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.180
We want to take advantage

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.220
of those opportunities already,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.280
but we have weaknesses, the first

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.880
thing we have to do is work internally

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.200
on those weaknesses to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140
be able to take advantage of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.580
external opportunities.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.520
And lastly, the worst of the circumstances,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.480
it turns out that you have many internal

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.540
weaknesses and in addition

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.100
is that the market will not grow.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.080
In this case, the strategy

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.580
here is nothing but pure

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.480
survival.
