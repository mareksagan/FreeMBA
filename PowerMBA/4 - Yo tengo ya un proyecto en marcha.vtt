00:00.000 --> 00:08.620
Many of the Power MBAs already have entrepreneurial projects.

00:08.620 --> 00:13.120
In different situations, there are people who have just started and there are people who have raised

00:13.120 --> 00:14.820
some money.

00:14.820 --> 00:19.400
The issue is that we see that almost all entrepreneurs, not only Power MBAs,

00:19.400 --> 00:25.240
but in general, are making the mistake that we have warned a thousand times.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.160
We have talked a thousand times about this, but it is because it is necessary.

00:28.160 --> 00:34.400
And it is that they are pushing their value proposition without having reached Product Market Fit.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.840
We also called it, remember, scaling prematurely.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.440
We are seeing that many Power MBAs with entrepreneurial projects that have not yet

00:42.440 --> 00:47.040
kicked, are worrying about things that are not important.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.320
Well, like making a business plan, or making a canvas, or making a pitch deck, or looking for

00:51.320 --> 00:58.600
suppliers, or looking for financing from the beginning, or partners, or they are worried about marketing,

00:58.600 --> 00:59.920
making noise...

00:59.920 --> 01:03.280
All that is pushing something that you have not yet validated.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.320
And this, which I have explained many times, what leads you is to have mediocre results.

01:08.320 --> 01:13.280
It's like, this example that I like so much, it's like if we stop the development, the learning

01:13.280 --> 01:15.640
of a child when he is 8 years old.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.560
Well, that's what's going to happen.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.920
When you have already reached Product Market Fit, when you bill millions, what you have

01:23.920 --> 01:28.960
to do, the next challenge, is the phase of Growth or Scaling.

01:28.960 --> 01:34.440
In which, what you are going to do is, that model that you have validated, that exact model,

01:34.440 --> 01:38.640
value proposition, segment of clients, channels, everything absolutely optimized, the only thing

01:38.640 --> 01:41.360
you have to do is repeat it.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.720
When you are in that phase, it may be that you find that you no longer have to continue

01:45.720 --> 01:48.560
innovating, because you have come up with something that is very powerful and what you have to do

01:48.560 --> 01:50.720
is scale it as fast as possible.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.080
But how many people are in that situation?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.480
Very few people are in that situation.

01:54.480 --> 01:59.000
And until you get to Product Market Fit, what you have to do is not worry about those

01:59.000 --> 02:03.160
things we have seen before, what you have to do is keep looking, which is something we

02:03.160 --> 02:05.600
learn in Power Launch Formula.

02:05.600 --> 02:11.080
Search and search, evolve your value proposition as many times as necessary, explore new segments

02:11.080 --> 02:15.320
of clients, new channels, search and search and search until everything fits.

02:15.920 --> 02:20.520
So if you have a project going, what I'm going to do is ask you a series of questions,

02:20.520 --> 02:23.120
of reflections, and you will come to the conclusion yourself.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.360
First, have you reached Product Market Fit?

02:27.360 --> 02:31.600
Regardless of whether you have reached it or not, I would like you to answer this question,

02:31.600 --> 02:34.360
what are you doing?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.400
What are you worried about?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
What are you?

02:37.400 --> 02:42.560
Worrying about pushing it, about marketing, about the providers, about the partners?

02:42.560 --> 02:49.600
Or are you just doing the important thing, which is to look for, to evolve your proposal,

02:49.600 --> 02:53.440
look for segments of clients to reach Product Market Fit?

02:53.440 --> 02:58.440
There are people who know a lot and say, until you reach Product Market Fit, all you have

02:58.440 --> 03:01.920
to do is look for Product Market Fit.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.480
So answer this question, what are you doing?

03:04.480 --> 03:08.920
Are you worrying about the important things or not?

03:08.920 --> 03:15.160
Another basic question, could you describe your customer?

03:15.160 --> 03:20.840
You would know how to give us a very convincing answer of who they are, but not who they are

03:20.840 --> 03:25.960
because you want to sell them to them, who they are because you have empirically validated

03:25.960 --> 03:29.840
that those customer people buy you or want to buy you.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.360
Can you explain to me how they are?

03:31.360 --> 03:37.160
Or more importantly, can you explain to me why they buy you or why they buy you?

03:37.160 --> 03:40.120
Have they told you with their own words?

03:40.120 --> 03:44.040
Could you explain to me what hurts them?

03:44.040 --> 03:50.280
If they see that your value proposal gives solution to those problems they have, do you know the

03:50.280 --> 03:54.920
words they use to explain what happens to them?

03:54.920 --> 04:00.160
Do you know the words they use to explain the value they see in your proposal?

04:00.160 --> 04:04.800
You have to know all this before building your product, because your value proposal

04:04.800 --> 04:06.600
will help you a lot.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.160
So if you have already started to invest time and money in creating a value proposal or

04:11.160 --> 04:16.040
creating an MVP, rather the first version of your product, without understanding everything

04:16.040 --> 04:23.000
before, I recommend that you rethink things, I recommend that you work on the bases of

04:23.000 --> 04:29.080
your business, which are none other than your client, understand your clients very well.

04:29.080 --> 04:34.680
And I ask you another question, is it possible that you have already started, which is the first

04:34.680 --> 04:39.640
thing that is usually done, to create your product, and your product is made up of, your

04:39.640 --> 04:43.600
value proposal is made up of a series of things, of functionalities, characteristics, call it

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
whatever you want.

04:44.600 --> 04:53.080
Well, I'm going to ask you a question, why have you decided to incorporate those characteristics?

04:53.080 --> 04:57.400
Because you think that is what you have to do or because you have validated one by one that

04:57.520 --> 05:02.200
each of those characteristics provides a value, the clients know how to explain it to you,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
they have verbalized it.

05:03.200 --> 05:11.480
If so, great, if not, if what you are doing is giving assumptions,

05:11.480 --> 05:14.240
that you know that you are taking a huge risk.

05:14.240 --> 05:20.120
To finish, we are going to give you some advice, something that we repeat a lot, but it is that in what

05:20.120 --> 05:25.240
we truly believe, and that is that if you have an entrepreneurial project, but you have not reached

05:25.560 --> 05:30.520
product market fit and therefore you are not in the growth or scaling phase, what you have to do

05:30.520 --> 05:37.400
is have your mind very open and you have to keep looking, you have to evolve your value proposal,

05:37.400 --> 05:41.920
iterate, pivot your business model as many times as necessary until you reach product

05:41.920 --> 05:42.920
market fit.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.120
Why?

05:44.120 --> 05:49.760
Because when you reach product market fit and everything fits, I assure you that everything

05:49.760 --> 05:55.200
will be much easier for you, you will grow a lot, the marketing will be

05:55.200 --> 06:00.760
very easy to do, you will earn a lot more money, you will have the bases to build a successful model.
