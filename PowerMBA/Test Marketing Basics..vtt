00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.040
Let’s get the answers to the marketing

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.600
test.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.580
There are 20 questions and 25

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.440
correct answers.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720
What is the best variable or

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.800
criterion to segment?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.380
This is something that is subjective but

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.560
it is our opinion and it is very well-founded.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.260
We want you to be on fire that you

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.460
always have to incorporate in your

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.460
segmentation always the criterion

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.720
of the benefit that customers

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.000
are looking for or the problem

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.620
you are solving.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.140
You always have to segment like this.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.700
The members of the conformist

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.580
have a desire to learn.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.500
We are describing the client.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
We are using psychographic

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.160
variable, psychographic segmentation.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.880
We are segmented by profiles.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.220
Entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.780
professionals, freelance, managers.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.140
We are also segmenting, but we are

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.820
segmenting according to what we are segmenting.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.880
In this case, what is the variable?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.860
This is a demographic segmentation.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.480
Now we will segment by profit

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.660
that, as I have said, is the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.600
most valuable to define

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.780
our value proposals, to increase

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.940
the effectiveness and efficiency

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.640
of our marketing campaigns,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.340
etc.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.960
It is also the most strategic.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.260
What segments would we get?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.780
Let us see.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320
People who want to start a company.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.640
This is the benefit we are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.360
looking for.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.120
Businesses with a turnover of

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.200
more than 1 million euros.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.620
No, this is not describing a benefit.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.780
I am describing the starting point.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.800
This is based on a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200
demographic variable.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.060
Therefore no.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.240
People who want to update their knowledge.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.500
Yes, it is a benefit, isn’t it?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.220
Or entrepreneurs who want to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.460
know the tools to grow their

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.940
company.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.040
It is also a benefit.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.220
Is the positioning dependent on competition?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.740
Yes, it depends on the competition.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.300
Positioning is the place we occupy

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.060
in the customer’s mind, but

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.180
obviously it depends on the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.340
gap competitors leave us.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.960
Imagine that you want your

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.060
positioning to be the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.280
reference in cola drinks.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.040
It’s a bit complicated because

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.780
Coca-Cola is probably the most

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420
valuable brand in the world.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.440
It’s an extreme example, but I want

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.660
you to understand why

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.420
positioning depends on competition.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100
We’ll define the script of the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.320
messages to attract and convince a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.020
customer.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.220
This is a competition

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.160
that is truly differentiating.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.400
Know how to transmit our messages

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.760
well, know how to appeal

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.400
to key messages to get in

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.720
touch and convince how to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.220
start?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.460
Every story.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.640
How do we?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.700
Do we show you your problem?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.540
Do we give them confidence and security?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.260
Do we tell you the plan?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.740
So, how will we help him?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.380
Or do we start by making him see what

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.120
the happy end is or what the desire is?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.260
The best answer is four.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.440
The way to stick someone is from

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.540
the beginning that they perceive,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720
see the benefit, feel identified

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.240
with that desire, make

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.640
them see the happy end.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.100
By the way, I also like the answer

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.420
A, we also gave it as valid, because

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.160
it is true that you can also

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.220
empathize and stick a lot

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.820
if someone makes him see

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.160
from the beginning the problem

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.960
he has.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.740
The answer B and C are not good.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.760
Why is?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.160
Because generating confidence and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760
security or letting you very clear what

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.100
the plan is, how you will help you, is

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.040
a necessary condition, obviously,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.840
but it is not the first thing.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.300
The first thing is that you have

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.820
to show the customer how you will help

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.260
him, how he will change his life

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.640
and then to buy you, because yes,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.600
you will have to generate confidence

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.140
and security or you will have

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.720
to tell him how you will help him.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.260
Thus, these two answers are

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.900
good.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.080
What is the customer person?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.240
What are the benefits?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.000
And here what we say is that one

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.760
answer that is incorrect, understand

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.140
that they are hurt by the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.880
problem, yes, improve our marketing

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.480
campaigns, yes, the customer

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.060
person helps us to understand

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.460
the customers very well and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.640
so we will improve the marketing

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.500
campaigns.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.540
Can you measure the size of the market?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.900
The truth is, no, there are other

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.440
tools you already know or should

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.520
already know, such as tam samson,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.860
for example, but the customer

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.000
person is to understand, not

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.040
to quantify.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.120
A powerful brand that allows us,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.000
allows us to connect better with

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.200
customers who share our values,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.560
allows us to sell more expensive,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.160
allows us to generate entry

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.040
bars, all are correct.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.160
The customer journey is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.100
a tool that you need to know very

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.080
well because it is excellent.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.360
To understand how our customers

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.180
feel at each touchpoint,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.480
yes, to understand if the customer

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.660
experience is different between

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.520
the different segments, because

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.800
we do a customer journey for

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.060
each segment or for each

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.520
customer person and understand

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.860
if there are differences.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.020
To identify things that we must improve

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.580
in the short term, because yes,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.140
many times the customer journey

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.340
we identify things that then

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.580
become a quick win because we

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.000
make small changes that increase

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the customer experience

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.100
very much.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.180
And to quantify customer experience

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.320
as if it were an objective

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.820
and comparable indicator, no,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.700
the customer journey is a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.960
tool to understand, to improve,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960
but it is not a tool

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.460
to measure customer

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.640
experience.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.400
This might be the NPS.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.920
Let us now talk about the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.580
different approaches to fixing prices,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.060
cost, market and value.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.240
A consultant, how should I do it?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.620
I’m not telling you how they do it, but

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.340
how they should.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.460
A consultancy is a high-value

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.720
service company and should

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.920
be able to set prices based

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.700
on the value that customers

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.660
have.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.040
If you have to do it based on

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.480
cost, hours, or the market,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.500
etc., it’s because you’re

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.940
not providing enough value.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.420
In contrast, in the red oceans,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.120
in the highly competitive markets,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.500
where proposals are very

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.420
indifferent, etc., companies

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.480
are usually forced to

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.340
fix prices according

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.160
to what.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.020
Look, basically, at the cost and

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.600
competition, mainly at the competition,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.960
because you cannot get out

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.080
of the competition’s prices

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.260
because you are not different

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.360
from others.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.780
And in addition, in many cases

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.460
it is true that the cost that all

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.460
competitors are putting or the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.620
price they have obtained through,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.000
from the cost, because

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.500
increasing something it, that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.000
is, making a markup to get a margin.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.280
You need to know why customers

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.240
buy you.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.560
What is the main trigger?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.640
Why are they buying you?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.000
Why is?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.760
Let us think.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.220
Why are you different from your competitors?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.820
No is no.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.260
I don’t buy things because they’

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.420
re different from others.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.580
Why customer experience,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.020
wow?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.780
No, not even

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.180
Why do we trust these companies?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.780
No to.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.180
I buy things and you and everyone

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.180
else buy products or services

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.300
that give a response to a problem

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.420
we have, that satisfies

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.700
a need, that generates a

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.820
benefit for us.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.620
That is the main lever.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.900
Then, in addition, you will choose

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.460
one that is better than the others,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.560
that the customer experience is good,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.380
a company in which you generate trust.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.720
But the truth is that what

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.760
you buy is for that.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.140
And all companies have to have

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.680
this absolutely clear in

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.220
our head.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.800
Why do customers buy us?

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.560
What is more powerful?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.980
What makes you act more immediately?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.760


00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.660
To pay more?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.120
Avoiding a risk or problem or

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.320
getting a benefit?

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.080
For common sense,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.860
the first.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.110
We want to be a customer-centered company.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.030
You know that metrics are the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.230
determinants of any company’

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.830
s management.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.410
Depending on whether you measure one thing

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.350
or measure another, you will be

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.470
a type of question: What are the

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.970
most important metrics or some of

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.210
the most important to focus on the customer?

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.350
The NPS is.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.330
The conversion rate, yes.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.470
Because if we are increasing the

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.010
value added to the customer experience,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.670
the conversion rates

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.890
will improve.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.970
Sales, because sales do not

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.510
have to be directly representative

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.650
of that we are doing the

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.230
best with the customer.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.610
And we are also increasing sales

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.190
because we invest a lot more in marketing,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.830
but the customer experience

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.730
is not better.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.090
The revenue per head, that is, the

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.610
sales per employee, because we are

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.230
in the same.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.570
No, it is not directly

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.490
representative of customer experience.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.610
Or the chant rate?

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.590
In the chant rate, yes.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.370
What is the Chant Rate?

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.390
With the chant rate, what we measure

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.890
is the percentage of customers

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.790
that in each period you can measure

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.090
it per month, you can measure

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.870
it per year as you like it, they

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.530
are down.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.490
That is why we say that it is a very

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.650
representative metric that we are

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:16.430
improving or worsening, and we will

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.230
think that we want to look for a

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.570
positioning with a high degree of

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.290
differentiation, that is understood

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.870
very well in our market, that

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.630
clearly position us there.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.350
And we can choose from many

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.290
alternatives, which we have seen some

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.910
throughout the course, but we will

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.750
select several.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.570
If, for example, we choose to create

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.970
a new category, as we did in

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.690
The Power MBA and be the first,

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.490
it helps us.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.790
It clearly helps us.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.870
Or we can choose, imagine, because we are

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.110
the most expensive.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.570
The most expensive turret in the world.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.350
Well, it’s very, it helps

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.510
you to reach a position.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.090
Is being a customer-centric company

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.070
helping you to have

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.250
a differentiated positioning?

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.190
I think no.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.870
It is mandatory to be a customer-centric

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.930
company, but it doesn’t help you to differentiate

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.350
yourself from the proposals

00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.950
of others.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.110
The wrong option is this.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.750


00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.770
What comes first?

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.010
Positioning, understanding the customer

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.370
with segmentation and with the customer

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.850
person or marketing mix, which

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.030
is the most tactical.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.190
Well, since the first thing is

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.250
segmentation and customer person,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.570
it is to understand the customer

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.250
how it is, why it buys us, etc.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.490
We will then have to define

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.310
what our positioning is

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.010
and eventually we will have

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.270
to move to the most tactical,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.210
which is the marketing mix.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.040
Inditex, which has many brands like

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.540
Versca, like Zara, like Pull &

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.860
Bear, like Massimo Dutti.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.520
What is your brand architecture?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.440
They are independent brands.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.380
We’ll think of products like

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.820
Netflix, Cabify or Facebook

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.900
Ads.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.940
What are they?

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.280
Questionnaire, milk cows,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.240
stars or dogs?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.420
They are stars.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.920
Do you know why?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.760
Because they are products that are

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.960
in growing markets.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.340
Clearly all of them are

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.720
in growing markets and have

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.440
achieved a high market

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:01.800
share.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.120
These are good examples of stars.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.660
And finally, we want to quantify the

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.200
size of the market and we can do this

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.120
with two approaches.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.740
We can do it from above down.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.040
In other words, the market is

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.300
worth a billion euros.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.600
We’re going to get a share of

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680
2% and that gives us X, right?

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.260
Or we can do it from below

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.560
up, which is from the

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.580
observation of what

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.820
is happening, what we

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.980
are doing, the results

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.300
we are achieving, etc.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.980
We will extrapolate it upwards.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.720
I recommend that you always

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.980
incorporate both approaches, but

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.420
if we had to choose one, it is easier

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.940
for you to come to good conclusions

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.240
from the bottom-up approach,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.900
that by the way, everyone does

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.680
the opposite, but in many

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.280
cases they come to many

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.160
inconsistencies.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.580
What we’re going to do is

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.940
look around, analyze what’s happening,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.080
analyze the results we’

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.900
re having and from that we’

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.260
ll extrapolate it to the

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.320
total market.
