00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.150
There are different types of cash

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.470
flows and as you know depending on

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.030
whether we use some cash flows or others,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.390
we will be representing different

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.950
things.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.690
We will get different rates and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.270
we will also have to use different

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.650
discount rates.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.710
But well, what I just want now

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.130
is that you understand the difference

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.890
between the two that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.710
we consider to be the main ones.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.630
One is the free cash flow, which

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.330
is an absolutely basic term in finance

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.550
and the other is the equity cash

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.430
flow or shareholder cash flow.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.430
I will explain it using an

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.090
example.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.290
I think it will be very easy to understand.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.210
We will go back, it is an example that

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.270
we like to put and it is the purchase

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.710
of a house or a house because it

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.190
is easy for us all to get into that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.810
situation.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.950
We think that we have an asset,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.210
which in this case is a home,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.830
which generates rent revenues

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.310
of 2,000 euros per month

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.430
equal to 24,000 euros per year.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.350
This is what the tenant pays.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.150
That housing generates some expenses

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.370
that are light, supplies, etc.,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.430
those that are or municipal

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.110
fees, etc.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.390
It can be around 4,000 euros a year.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.330
If we were to make a profit

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.010
account as if we were a company,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.990
we would have a gross profit

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.150
of 20,000 euros a year.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.150
We are going to consider that the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.690
gross profit is equal to the net profit.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.170
We will consider that those 20,000

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.550
euros are not incorporated into the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.130
income tax.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.230
So we continue to descend.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.910
Keep in mind that companies,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.370
in addition to income, expenses,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.850
etc., have to face investments,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.390
investments in fixed assets,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.370
investments in circulating

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.650
assets, etc., which we only

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.850
have in the balances.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.270
This building requires

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.750
a re-investment every year.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.810
And it’s easy that it’s very intuitive.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.650
What reinvestments?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.130
Because we will have to paint

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.890
the walls from time to time,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.430
electrodes will be damaged, etc.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.690
We expect this investment

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.910
to be 5,000 euros per year.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.190
This is the first of the cash

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.890
flows, which is the free cash

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.510
flow.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.230
This is free cash flow.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.950
The free concept is used because

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.650
we have not yet taken into account

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350
how we have funded them.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.730
What the free cash flow informs

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.350
us is of the box or the tricks

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.550
that the company has generated during

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.070
that period, after having reinvested

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.130
in the fixed assets that need,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.090
after having reinvested in the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.250
circulating assets that need,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.510
for example, if you have to increase

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.830
the NOFs, which is a concept that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.330
we saw in accounting and that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.170
if you do not know you should

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.350
return, after having made

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.150
all the reinvestments,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970
we have the free cash

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.370
flow.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.470
But we have not yet paid the sources

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.310
of financing, we have not

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.350
paid the debt, if we have

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.950
received debt, we have not

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.270
paid the shareholders

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.390
through dividends, etc.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.790
That’s what the company itself has

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.410
generated, regardless of how you’ve

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.650
funded yourself.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.830
We do not take into account any entries

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.510
or debt amortisations, interest

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.170
or anything.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.190
This is the free cash flow.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.500
But really, in addition to understanding

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.480
how much the company generates, it’s

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.020
very important to also have the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.540
perspective of, well, how much it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360
generates partners.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.560
In this case, we will go

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.700
back to the example.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.300
The owners of the housing result

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.060
that they have been funded, are

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.400
leveraged, indebted, in this case

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.320
with a mortgage loan, in

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.460
which they have to assume a quota

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.860
every month, that the quotas

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.100
are, then, amortisation of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.500
the principal and interest,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.300
but we add everything.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.960
It’s out of the box, right?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.180
That is 8,000 euros a year.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.780
We can now calculate what the shareholder’

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.580
s cash flow is, which is that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.900
in this case is 7,000 euros.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.080
As you can see, before in the free

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.680
cash flow we talked about the cash

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.860
that the company generates after making

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.380
the reinvestments, etc., and that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680
cash will be used to remunerate

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.000
the providers of financing,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.440
whether it is own funds

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.700
or foreign funds.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.220
In this case, those 15,000 euros, 8,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.420
000 euros, that year are cash outputs

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.880
that will remunerate the debt providers,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.820
which are the banks, and the rest

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.360
is the cash flow of the shareholder,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.480
that is what the shareholders

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.500
receive.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.340
Finally, if we define the shareholder’

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.660
s cash flow, it’s very easy, it’s

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.700
very intuitive.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.740
They are funds generated by the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.620
company after reinvesting

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.200
in fixed assets, circulating

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.460
assets, etc., and after

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.900
having amortised, returned

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.300
the debt and paid interest.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.000


00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.840
Basically, it is what remains at the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.580
end of the whole, below the whole, the cash

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.720
flow that remains for the whole.
