00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.820
Marc, at The Power MBA we

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.980
have studied and analyzed

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.460
different growth engines.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.160
Every company has its own

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.960
characteristics, but there

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.220
are certain patterns.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.080
And for example, the case of The

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.920
Power MBA, and I say it to

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.360
illustrate it, and the case of

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.580
Your Ex-Love, are very different.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.200
We invest in customer acquisition,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.840
we have a cost of acquiring

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.620
customers, and what we do is

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.980
to recover more or less quickly

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.220
that investment, it allows

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.960
us to reinvest.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080
That is our growth engine,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.220
in our case it is a bit different.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.180


00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.940
Because while, like everyone

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.560
else, you have to invest in channels

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.480
to attract new customers,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.540
there is a strong viral component.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.320


00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.480
And in fact, one of the growth

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.680
engines we determine

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.800
is viral.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.860
And it is that, mainly, your

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.780
growth is organic.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.340
and exact.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.920
We, from the beginning, when

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.060
we were thinking about the product,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.300
we thought about having a product,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.820
as I said before, a product

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.400
with a lot of engagement,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.280
retention bar, and then

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.180
a product with very organic

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.360
growth.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
You have been instrumental...

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.700
This is partly due to what

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.320
we have thought about the product.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.700
Obviously there is one part that

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.860
is, when you have a good product,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.440
everyone recommends it.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.920
It is like Zara.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880
Zara doesn't advertise, but knows trends

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.920
very well, and people talk

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.240
and have grown without advertising.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.460
But Zara is not viral.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.040
I like to separate it.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.220
Zara is not really viral.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.680
Zara is what is by recommendation,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.800
mouth or ear.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.460
The shops generate a lot of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.300
notoriety, etc.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.780
It is not virality.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.960
I think it is viral.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.080
That is, your product, the use of

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.240
the product is designed, in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.760
part, so that you share it with

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.080
other people and that you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.060
generate new users.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.740
and exact.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.240
If you can separate it, as you say,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.100
between your mouth or your ear, which

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.900
is virality that you can't

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.080
measure, we call it so.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.320
Yes indeed.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.800
I had not explained it that way, but it

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.280
is true.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.520
And then you have the virality you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.440
can measure.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.840
We would be absolutely not interested

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.340
if a user brings us five new users

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.840
and we can measure it or we

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.740
can't measure it.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460
The consequence is the same.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.340
And it is true that there is a part of

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.560
virality, which is the one you commented

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.960
on, the one you can measure.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.460
On Tontium Buttons you can

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.800
share clothes with your friends, if they

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.080
do not download the app to see those

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.580
clothes.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.900
There are ways that all social

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.720
platforms affect you in sharing

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.540
and inviting...

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.640
Capture new users.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.620
This is very common in some countries,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.500
such as Dropbox.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.680
and exact.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.160
Dropbox is a product that is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.200
designed to make growth very

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.640
viral, but you can use it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.240
alone.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.400
But if I want to share a file

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.320
with you or a video conference

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.580
tool, for example, Mark, we'll do

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.200
a video conference, I'll

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900
send it to you, I'll send you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.460
the link and it's very likely

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.560
you will then use it, for example,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.200
right?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.120
The most popular is WhatsApp.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.180
by WhatsApp.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.000
I cannot talk alone, I can talk

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.520
to myself.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.000
In Tontium Buttons you can

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.560
use it alone, that's true.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280
So the virality factor can be slightly

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.840
smaller than a platform

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.980
like that, right?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.340
But it's true, our platform from one

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.840
part of the product is thought to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.080
be viral, but then in itself the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.260
product tends to get people to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.400
share it with their friends

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.500
be it mouth or ear, right?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.860
It is not measurable through links

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.020
or through those tools.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.440
And you have measured the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.980
impact of all this, that is, what

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.920
percentage is organic, what percentage

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.060
is paid for growth,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.360
more or less?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.220
Yes, yes, yes, we, and we like to measure

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.540
it pretty much everything and, that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.540
is, we know, even paid traffic brings

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.380
you organic traffic, right?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.120
In that sense, that is, you also

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.480
get virality from paid traffic,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.820
it's not just organic traffic

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.040
itself, right?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.000
I mean, I invest 100 euros

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.020
on Facebook, I get, imagine,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.940
I get 100 installs, I am not

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.400
inventing the numbers, those 100

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.580
people enter Twention Buttons and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.560
they share many with their friends

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.280
the link, they recommend it to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.700
their friends, so I have those

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.180
100 euros really not only provided

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.900
me 100 users, they have provided

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.640
me a lot more, likewise,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.760
an investment paid also gives

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.380
me virality in that sense, and

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.520
it is a snowball that is increasing

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.940
in that sense, the good thing

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.900
is to have a product that encourages

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.700
the snowball to go down,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.600
that is that there is a drop,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.480
with which is the idea

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.080
of how the product

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.920
is structured.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.920
Yes, of course, that growth is ever

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.400
greater, organic growth is greater,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.840
the coefficient of that we analyze,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.320
that if the virality coefficient

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.480
is greater than one, of course,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.920
your growth is exponential

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.360
at that time and the costs of

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.020
acquiring customers in the end

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.660
tend to be almost zero.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.780
They go down, depending on what you

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.620
want to continue investing so

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.280
that that exponential curve

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.020
is greater or less fast, as

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.320
you say.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.080
Effectively, and from the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.560
perspective of, let us analyze

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
the growth engine from the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.820
perspective of income generation,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.240
the financing of that

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.780
engine, etc.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.500
Do you understand this, do you understand

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.200
the users?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.620
Do you monetize them over a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.260
period of time?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.260
How do you finance this growth, etc?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.280
We at first is a model that requires

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.480
to be capital intensive, that

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.900
we do not hide and the rounds

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.580
we have made are public, with

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.600
which it is a model that at the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.340
end you need to have

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.680
a user on your platform, you

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.300
need to have a good product

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.240
so that that user ends up

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.940
buying, but that purchase can

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.060
reach you on day 1, you can

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.580
reach day 10, you can

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.240
reach day 50, you can not

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.080
arrive.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.440
Yes, but you have estimated a few half.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.060
Exactly, so if we want to grow

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.280
fast, we need to break

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.060
that circle because with the

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.220
money that comes into the box you

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.100
could go growing gradually

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.760
but you could not launch 5

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.520
markets in the following year.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.080
I will put you a case that is the opposite,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.160
which is the case of Hawkers.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.360
Hawkers grew so much because

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.320
he could fund his growth directly

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.700
from the margin he is getting

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.920
day by day, which in our case,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.720
in the case of Poverty,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.320
is a bit similar too.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.140
It is less capital-intensive,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.360
if you get a lot of money you

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.580
grow much faster and it is

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.540
beneficial.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.780
You told us that in our case it

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.780
is not so, the customer lifetime

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.020
value you receive over time,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.340
so that with that you could finance

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520
your growth, but as your ambition

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.800
is, because you have a spectacular

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.140
product, your ambition is

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.580
to grow as fast as possible,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.800
because it is better to put

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.920
more gasoline and grow

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.620
faster.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.120
Exactly, if I want to be market

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.000
leader in this sector, I can't

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.240
expect to grow with the

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.200
money we get thanks to monetization.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.380
If I delay, I invent it, 10 months

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.680
to recover the cost of a user, I

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.680
can not wait 10 months to be able

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.700
to acquire another user,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.320
I need to be able to acquire it

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.960
the next day, and that day

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.620
I have to finance it with

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.180
external money.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.260
The key growth engine methods

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.680
in this case I understand would

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.700
be customer lifetime value,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.080
customer acquisition cost, CAC

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.900
payback, which is the time you

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.480
recover that, which depends

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.900
on customer lifetime value, obviously,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.880
and the percentage of the

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.760
organic versus the paid.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.280
At the end, it is in the

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.540
CAC.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.220
It really has an impact on the CAC.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.300
It depends on what you consider to

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.240
be CAC, whether it's just the cost

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.380
of acquisition for a user, or if

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.120
it's the users who just connect,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.780
then you assign the cost of the

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.900
users who are from the chart,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.160
of the users who no longer follow.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.020
That is, at the end you have to

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.760
compare pears with pears, and that's

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.640
where you want to introduce it.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.800
But yes, there is no more.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.140
It is how much a user gives you

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.940
and the profit you can get.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.280
How much a user gives you, how much it

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.560
costs you to capture it, how long you

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.840
recover that investment, and how you

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.160
do to generate that engine that allows

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.580
you to grow as quickly as possible.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.700
If you can do it with what you generate

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.080
the business, phenomenal.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.340
If in this case the deadline is

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.520
longer and you want to be a market

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.820
leader, what you have to do is

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.700
inject money.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.680
It all depends on the strategy you

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.360
have inside.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.960
It's true that what it means is that

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.500
you are eventually selling shares

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.060
of the company to external investors,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.620
but it's also true that you can

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.260
get a higher return because

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.680
you have a much larger company at

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.840
the level of users, at the

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.040
level of countries in which you

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.920
are present.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.580
of course.
