00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.340
What would you say are the

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.640
critical success factors in the

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.240
acquisition or merger, in

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.100
the integration after an

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.280
acquisition or a merger?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.820
I do, there is one thing I feel

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.060
proud of in my life, that I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.500
feel proud of many things, but it

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.580
is that I have had the luck to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.240
make so many acquisitions.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.400
Because a purchase, the purchase of

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.860
a company and making it part of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400
your world, the first thing accelerates

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.940
your knowledge of others at

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.060
a brutal speed.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.840
That is, what you would know in a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.420
company in three years, in five

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.140
days, you have to know.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.800
And you know it better than the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.580
owner, because you have to

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.920
do doodle, e.t.c.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.660
And second, you learn so much from

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.840
people who have been so successful,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.920
that it's a brutal experience.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.940
This is to give you the two sides

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.720
of the coin, what is right,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.920
what is wrong, how complicated it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.760
is to integrate a company.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.700
And I'm going to give you some formulas

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.420
of what has gone well in over 60 and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120
so many acquisitions that I've done

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.680
in 20 and so many countries in

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.240
the world.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.360
The first thing is to be very clear about

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.320
what you want to do.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.480
When you buy a company, you

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.740
have to have a strategy for

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.920
what you buy it.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.200
The second is that the company

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.680
meets the goal you have purchased.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.640
That is, if I want to win market

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.380
share, that company has to be

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.320
in the markets where I am not

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.200
and be solid in their customer base.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.600
If it turns out that I want to win market

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.040
and have no customers, because that's what

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.900
they want to do.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.500
It is a major factor in that.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.660
This is something you have to look

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.500
at before you make a purchase.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.860
The second is to be very clear with

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.860
employees.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.900
There is always a fear of telling the truth.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.880
I have never been afraid to tell

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.440
the truth.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.220
So, being very clear the day after

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.940
the purchase and say, look, what's

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.220
going to happen is this, this,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.640
this and this.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220
What will not happen is this.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.720
And that it happens.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.700
For example, when I made a purchase,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.620
I changed the financial director

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.660
of the other company.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.490
always to.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.950
I did not even talk...

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.530
When I say I didn't talk to him, I don't

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.330
want to...

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.550
Of course I was talking to him.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.750
And also humanly tried to understand

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.590
why.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.230
But a financial manager in an integration

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.710
is someone fundamental.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.910
If you are financially unable to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.350
connect the company, you have a problem.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.410
The financial manager has to be changed.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.490
It is not about judging whether

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.290
it is good or bad.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.050
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.330
That is, culturally, if you

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.710
are not able to tie the company

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.090
financially the next day, you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.450
are lost.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.350
And that's something I've done

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.350
from the beginning.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.770
The second is the brand.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.650
The brand can't be waiting to see

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.850
what's going to happen with

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.350
integration to see what we do with

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.090
the brand.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.170
The next day, the brand strategy

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.490
has to be put into effect.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.930
It was always the same.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.290
We came to the companies we bought

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750
and they said already, but it is

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.930
that my brand is very well known,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.510
we can't lose it.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.070
We'll wait a couple of years

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.490
to see.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.230
No to.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.850
The brand strategy.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.490
Look, your brand will pass this,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.370
this, this.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.170
We will inform the employees and we

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.090
will do it tomorrow.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.610
It cannot be quiet.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.490
The brand strategy must

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.550
be clear.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.670
And then, what are your goals?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.670
So that the new company, both

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.650
those who are bought and those

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.930
who buy, understand what the goals are.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.110
What is what to do?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.630
If those things were in the after

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.390
briefing, I would always personally

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.450
be in front of all the employees

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.610
the next day every time I

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.250
made a purchase.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.570
And when I say all employees, it's

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.310
everyone.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.890
That is, I bought companies with 3,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.470
000 employees and had to travel that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.350
day to three cities across Europe.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.010
I have done.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.150
But in one day I saw all the employees

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.890
and made it very clear to them

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.010
how many I was going to fire.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.610
Why would he have to dismiss them

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.290
and how much would he pay them in public,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.130
in front of everyone else?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.270
Who would not be able to give up

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.730
if they met the goals we had

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.390
and what were they?

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.510
What would happen to the brand

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.230
and that financially, I'm sorry,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.810
but there was absolute control?

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.330
Only when you do that can you succeed.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.690
If you leave any of those

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.770
legs over time, the detractors,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.270
the pessimists, the negatives,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.910
start to devour the company.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.750


00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.870
These are the rules that should

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.910
be clearly defined the next day.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.890
And then it has to be very

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.390
clear.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.630
A company is said to be when you

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.170
buy a company one plus one are

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.750
two.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.470
I've never made a purchase of my 60s

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.290
and so many acquisitions in 20s

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.550
and so many countries in the world

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.870
where I've seen one plus one are

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.330
two.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.090
If you get one plus one,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.710
you can be very happy.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.990
There are acquisitions that have

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.350
been successful, most have been very

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.650
successful, and there are acquisitions

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.990
that have really failed to

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.690
meet our goals.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.390
For example, where we have failed

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.170
most is with the famous cross-selling.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.150
We always think I have a product,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.210
you have another product, I buy

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.030
you and we will do a cross-

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.590
selling of the databases.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.050
And we are never and always unable

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.330
to realize what it means for

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.370
a customer to handle a product.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.370
The learning time, the learning curve,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.950
the investment you have made,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.270
the Stockholm syndrome you have,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.070
even if it doesn't go well, you

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.610
want it.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.770
When you try to transform your product

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.990
for another, because you know

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.170
it's better, human barriers are

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.910
not taken into account.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.790
So I can tell you that cross-

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.270
selling, not just in my personal

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.490
experience, when you study

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.830
other cases, has not been

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.830
so easy.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.690
And it's because we don't take into account,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.450
we always make a calculation

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.470
sheet, we make a business plan, we

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.450
do things that don't have soul.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.310
And when we put the soul on it we

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.350
realize that there are people

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.470
behind it and those people somehow

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.930
don't want to change in some case.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.370
It's better, but I don't want to change.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.890
And that is not rational.
