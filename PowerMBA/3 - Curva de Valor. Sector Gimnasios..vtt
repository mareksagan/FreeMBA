WEBVTT

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.720
Today we are with Iñaki Pelegrí.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640
Thank you very much for being with

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.180
us today.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.200
It will be very interesting

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.140
and enriching for everyone.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.660


00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.540
Iñaki is an entrepreneur in the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.740
gyms sector.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.740
I don't know if you call it that way.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.400
Yes, the gym industry.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.540
It is called.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.140
Good afternoon and a pleasure

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.600
to be with you.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.860
First, tell us what you are doing and

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.440
then we go into the matter.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.800
and Genius.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.260
I work in a company that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.920
runs four centers

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.920
as franchisees.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.060
Altavit is a chain of gyms.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.820
Well, it is the chain that has

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880
the most centers in Spain of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.180
41 centers and we manage four

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.580
of them in the figure of franchise.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.480
of the franchise.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.100
Well well perfect.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.180
Someday we will talk about that because

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.660
it is a very interesting topic the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.040
relationship of

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.720
franchise-franchise with the chain

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.900
that provides you, etc.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.580
Well, someday we will see it.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.020
and Genius.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.960
When you want, you are available here.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.300
We will call you again.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.040
Well, Iñaki come and go.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.040
What we're going to do

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.840
is draw the value curve

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.620
of the gym sector.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.640
and perfect.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.480
So, the first thing we will do

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.360
is, let's identify what are

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.160
the competitive factors

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.240
to the variables.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020
That is, what are the factors in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.240
which you invest, well, you

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.420
and all the competitors, all

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080
invest, and which are the ones

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020
that determine the value offered

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.300
by the customers, the factors

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.460
also by which, from the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.340
point of view of the customers,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.000
since we choose one gym

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.120
or choose another.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.980
Which would be?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.200
We will see them one by one.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.220
and perfect.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.420
One of the most important things, the bigger

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.260
thing, is the price.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.960
There are many segments within the sector

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.000
and, the giant, because the price

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.700
varies greatly from one to the other.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.720
The convenience is also important,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.300
that is, the place where the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.060
gym is by proximity and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880
others, good, then, the giant,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.980
by rent depending on the area

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.280
where it is, the local

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980
size, etc.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.480
Then another of the important

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.880
factors is the sports equipment,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.380
the staff, the giant that the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.660
gym has, to give more or

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.040
less personalized attention.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.400
The subject of the directed classes is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.200
very important.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.900
Classes would also be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.480
related to staff, right?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.240
If you have to give classes...

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.800


00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.440
It depends, because there are several.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.940
We don't do it because we don'

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.800
t like it, but there are many

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.600
chains that offer virtual

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.800
classes.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.260
That is, they are the service of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.220
directed activities, but they do

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.140
not have personnel for it.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.740
The staff is, in a video, a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.380
projection that, logically,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.120
can be given at any time.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.260
You bet on that, logically.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.560
So, I said, did you say

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.160
the price?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.660
It is clear.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680
This is a sector where there is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.720
a sensitivity to the price.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.580
The convenience, really the gym

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.460
is chosen many times for convenience,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.940
it is chosen because it guides you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.440
close to your work, your home,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.100
whatever it is.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.040
You've talked about equipment, which

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.780
is all the investment you make in machinery,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.680
then, of all kinds, isn't it?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.600
I also think it is a lot of money.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.480
Have you talked about personal care?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.300
That is where we could also

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.100
put personal training.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.180
Some chains, then, are more powerful

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.800
than others.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.220
The collective classes.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.120
And I would tell you there is maybe another,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.480
well, there is some more, but there is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.360
one that is like it is in the local, right?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.160
That is, what you do, that is not

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.880
really the sports equipment,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.080
but the environment.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.220
Yes, yes, that could be considered

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.440
also effectively the design, the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.420
environment that is in a local.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.600
This can also be considered a factor.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.120
This is important from the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.160
customer's point of view as well.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.820
Whether it is pleasant or not,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.900
there is a difference.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.480
It depends on the segment

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.340
within the sector.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.820
The manager is more important in one

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.800
premium segment than in another, the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.560
manager who at the end is more

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.160
important the price.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.940
actually is.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.620
That is.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.420
Is the time a factor you compete

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.080
with or not?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.080
The timetable, well, is that

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.540
the truth is that the timetables

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.400
are now very wide in most chains.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.960
That is, now whoever says he doesn'

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.920
t have time to go to the gym

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.020
really, I don't believe it.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.320
This is a reason that is not sustainable.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.540
We, for example, open from seven

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.840
in the morning to ten and a half eleven

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.580
in the evening, in the end of the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.320
zones and others.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.860
That is, that at the end of the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.620
day is a very, very wide schedule

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.580
and it is a manager, because at

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.440
that time you can always come as often

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.260
as you want, be as long as you want.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.100
All of you have invested in the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.800
schedule.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.000
This is that...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.680
actually is.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.400
Well, by the way...

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.080
In the end, he is also the manager.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.320
The more hours you have open, the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.480
more people you need to

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.680
cover the hours.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.580
More cost of.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.580
How is the sector?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.600
I see the sector well.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.200
I see it because, well, you see

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.080
it.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.900
This is what you see with the competitors,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.200
with the players who are entering the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.100
game.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.360
Three, four years ago, well,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.140
there was, the manager, there

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.520
were chains of gyms, but

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.800
now they are entering many.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.040
And the truth that, well, because it is

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
a time that the truth that will be interesting

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.500
because there is more and more

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.520
competition, more competitors, forgives.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.860
And logically, we each

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.680
have to win and fidelize our

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.340
customers to continue to grow.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.280
I think the sector still

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.240
has a lot of opportunities to grow.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.500
I think they are effectively entering

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.180
chains that, well, because they will

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.780
continue to enter during these months,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.180
these years and so on.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.540
And that's something, well, as you

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.540
know, because people are very fashionable.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.820
The theme of fitness, health,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.900
care and more.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.520
It is increasingly demanded by

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.920
society.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.620
I have no doubt.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.140
I think...

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.100
The market will grow.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.560
What happens is that what the

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.100
market is that we will see in subsequent

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.440
courses is a red ocean because

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.520
there are more and more

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.260
competitors, you have to make

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.920
more efforts.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.700
Look at what you said.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.800
We all have to open for a

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.480
lot of hours.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.100
If you don't open for a long time, then now.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.420
The search for differentiation

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.320
is permanent.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.100
Let's see one thing.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.040
What are the competitors segments?

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.600
I think we can divide it into

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.760
four segments.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.880
This is the premium segment.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.900
The one with a higher price, well,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.940
there are a number of more personalized

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.920
services.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.380
Then there is what's been sticking

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.840
stronger for three years,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.880
which are low cost gyms.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.480
Then there are the convenience

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.900
gyms, life-long neighborhood

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.180
gyms, which are smaller.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.660
And it's true that they are suffering

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.340
a lot, especially with the big

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.760
chains of crazy people coming in.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.820
Sorry to cut you.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.820
What you say about convenience

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.620
gyms, I know a chain of

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.280
convenience gyms

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.400
that is fine, but, in fact,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.740
they are generally decreasing.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.800
This is explained very well.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.740
If we put ourselves in the generic strategies

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.780
of what Michael Porter told

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.440
us, you have to choose whether

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.960
they buy you for being better or

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.140
for being cheaper.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.960
If you stay in the middle, you

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.400
are there.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.160
And it's also that it has happened

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.380
to many because in the same neighborhood

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.220
you have a gym that costs 80

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.560
euros, great, with a pool, with

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.700
some bestial services.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.280
If you want to spend 80 euros, go to

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.660
that.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.980
And then you have the low cost

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.700
chains, which have far more economical prices.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.460
And then, who goes to the neighborhood

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.040
gym that costs 45?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.320
What is older?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.660
What so?

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.260
No one goes.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.860
No, it is complicated.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.280
The truth is that they have it difficult.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.840
In the end, what I will do is differentiate

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.220
from some other way and a more

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.620
personalized and other treatment.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.340
Of course, it depends on the agency

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.880
the possibilities you have.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.420
But it is true that for them the

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.640
time is difficult.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.620
They should almost become, for

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.540
example, niches.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.740
For example, they specialize

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.460
in muscular training.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.940
actually is.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.860
What happens is that that leads us

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.700
to the fourth segment we were talking

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.440
about, which is a bit of the boutiques.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.680
It will be practically this, but

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.020
logically much more novel.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.160
That is, a much more personalized

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.060
treatment, of very specific services.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.120
What happens is that in the end...

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.460
A shop, what do you mean?

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.020
Is it a typical gym where you're going

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.620
to do yoga or just boxing?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.160
That is.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.000
It is much more fashionable in the United

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.840
States or the United Kingdom, but

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.340
it is finally coming to Spain.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.240
And probably here in a few months or

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.020
a few years, a few months I would say,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.920
I'm sure it'll hit strong.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.000
In the end, what they really want

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.100
to do is differentiate themselves

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.960
from the rest.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.680
They will give you a very good service, of

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.460
something very specific.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.720
And there are people, of course, who

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.300
are willing to pay for it.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.460
This is a niche strategy

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.540
or segmentation strategy.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.520
We have seen the competitive factors.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.180
We said it was the price, convenience,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.760
the environment, the size of

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.580
the premises.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.780
It hasn't come out, but it should

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.960
be one, maybe, because there

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.020
are bigger than smaller.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.360
What you invest in sports equipment,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.640
in machinery.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.160
What you invest in staff.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.960
And then the schedule, we said.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.200
The schedule will be the same for everyone,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.860
more or less.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.960
and the services.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.460
They are competitive factors.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.980
We will draw the curve of each

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.700
of the elements.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.800
What are the premium gyms?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.640
Premium gyms, logically,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.440
would have a much higher

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.320
price than the rest.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.260
How much more or less?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.520
It may cost you a portion of the fee.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.280
300 to 400 euros of registration.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.100
Then a monthly fee between 120 and

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.500
200 euros approximately.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:28.720
well is.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.580
More or less.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.640
They offer a lot of level of everything, right?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.700
of everything.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.620
Absolutely of everything.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.400
Especially the first sports equipment.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.880
The latest technology, the best

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.100
machines.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.240
A lot of staff.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.580
A lot of personalized attention.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.420
and personal training.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.020
and other.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.760
The design, of course, too.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.400
The Environment.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.980
Then a class of guidance.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.920
The very professional staff.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.220
Very well formed, logically.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.460
And in the end, that.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.600
Giving a practically exclusive treatment

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.220
to your customers.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.520
This is a clear differentiation strategy.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.280
They invest in everything.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.980
More than the others.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.460
And offer a higher value doubt.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.940
With higher prices.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.660
and perfect.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.020
and understood.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.660
I think there are not many

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.640
in the industry.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.020
I think they are not many.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.660
They are not many.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.260
They are not many.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.480
But there are logically areas

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.140
too.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.540
The areas where these customers

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.280
are usually installed are exclusive

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.980
or high purchasing power areas.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.800
Of course, in fact.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.860
Another factor is where you have the place.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.840
Depending on the amount, the investment

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.920
is either greater or lesser.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.080
Rental is not the same.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.440
In a neighborhood cheaper than in

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.700
a prime area of a large city.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.640
The clientle as well.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.200
The clients.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200
Not just the income, but the purchasing

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.100
power of the people living in

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.600
the area.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.220
That in the end, 80-90% are people

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.300
who live very close to you.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:57.980
actually is.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.740
Now for the low cost gyms.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.580
That is.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.820
The price of people is very

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.740
important.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.480
People are the first thing they look at.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.980
It gives less importance to the

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.420
rest.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.820
It is true that people are increasingly...

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.240
There are many competitors

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.900
as mentioned.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.280
In the end, you have to differentiate

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.820
yourself in some way.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.320
People are always asking

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.000
for better services.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.640
If you don't give it, it will go to someone

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.160
else who will probably give it.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.640
Or maybe what you are looking for

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.460
can be found elsewhere for

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.260
the same price.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.380
Yes, it is complicated then.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.680
Are they gymnastics, I think they are big?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.080
Yes, they are big.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.960
It usually has between 1500 and 2000

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.920
meters approximately.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.600
And what they actually do is that

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.820
they offer a very wide range of

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.540
services.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.660
They have free weight, free clothes,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.520
and free bodybuilding.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.820
activities are directed.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.720
And what allows you to do that is capture

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.240
a very large number of people.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.780
And of all ages.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.820
That is.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.440
This critical mass allows you to end up

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.280
being profitable.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.560
That is the volume.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.760
And it is that it gives you the doors to

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.320
people who in their life had gone

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.360
to a gym for a price.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.620
Because I wasn't willing to pay

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.720
60, 70 euros for a gym.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.900
Something they didn't know they would

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.420
like.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.360
And this gives you the option of

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.680
approving a gym at a very economical

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.780
price.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.040
And that people, as they have

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.400
a variety of products or

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.840
services quite varied.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.780
It gives you the chance.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.600
You end up liking it.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.820
People who haven't been to a gym.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.040
In the end, he becomes a fan.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.900
And that goes very often.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.240
We are seeing this in other sectors.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.980
in other activities.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.200
We talked to Colvin'

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.840
s boys.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.780
They have a marketplace in

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.500
the flower sector.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.020
Very interesting.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.060
You know him and so on.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.120
When you go down a lot.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.320
break the price barrier.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.380
More people are entering

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:53.960
any sector.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.600
In this case, it is the gym.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.820
But in Colvin's case, it's buying

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.420
flowers.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.360
You are generating new demand.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.100
No one can buy 80.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.700
And 20 or 25 people who have

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.240
not asked him.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.960
Buy and get stuck.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.260
Yes yes.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.420
That is one of the tricks.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.800
And I think actually.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.200
of the greatest successes.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.320
of the crazy.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.200
The neighborhood gyms.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.920
Let us draw.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.000
The curve of premium gyms is

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.580
very clear.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.400
It is above.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.140
The curve of the madmen is down

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:25.720
in everything.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.820
Less than the size of the gym.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.380
As for personal attention.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.620
You may have invested a lot of personal

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.340
attention.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.460
Because you have enough people.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.640
This creates a synergy.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.880
Economy of scale.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.340
Because there are so many customers.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.940
You can afford this

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.440
investment.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.420
Let us compare now.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.060
Low cost gyms like yours.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.980
With a gym.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.760
A neighborhood gym.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.380
How would it be?

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.400
It is true.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.060
At least our chain.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.580
We want to get rid of the

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.340
low cost.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.180
Because in the end we offer a

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.840
cheap price.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.380
But it is true that we are.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.820
Trying to differentiate.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.140
For example, among other things.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.180
In personal dealings.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.820
Having more people.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.580
To get more attention to the public and others.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.760
Technology to facilitate customers.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.180
Applications and more.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.780
In a low cost

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.400
gym.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.720
compared to the subject.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.580
The neighborhood gyms.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.840
I think the gym is.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.940
The problem is that at the

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.420
end.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.100
Oh that.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.840
A gym for people in the area.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.440
As his name says.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.740
What happens is the machine.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.840
It is a little more outdated.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.220
And what they offered.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.860
It was a personalized treatment.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.960
There is always the manager.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.820
The one who carried it.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.600
They used to be people.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.680
You know the world of gymnastics.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.780
He has trained a lot throughout

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.300
his life.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.800
He knows well.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.680
And that you can have a lot of deal.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.080
And advise your clients very well.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.060
Let them come.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.180
That of the neighborhood.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.420
and of the area.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.460
I think there is a word to explain.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.380
The competitive advantage they have.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.680
The neighborhood gyms.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.840
It is called a scale economy.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.760
They are in a market.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.560
In a market where.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.140
The price sensitivity is high.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.360
People are changing gym.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.800
It costs from 40 to 20.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.660
They go to 20.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.740
It is a reality.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.700
They have a clear competitive disadvantage.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.260
The economy of scale.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.500
You buy better.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.700
You are part.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.280
of a large group.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.360
There are thousands of synergies.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.200
In the management.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.700
Especially the economy of scale.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.260
In the purchase.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.160
The size of the gym.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.400
You have 1500 square meters.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.720
And at the end.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.780
There are many expenses.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.340
It will affect more partners.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.020
The neighborhood gym.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.220
It has a small place.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.360
All the machines are met.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.640
There is no alpha.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.320
It has a competitive disadvantage.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.280
At the cost of that.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.340
He cannot play with you.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.020
To be cheaper.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.840
It is impossible with the

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.520
structure it has.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.700
It does not provide differentiation either.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.960
The machines are old.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.500
The only differentiation.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.120
That is what we said.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.700
in the neighborhood gyms.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.880
More close relationships are established.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.220
You know the owner of the gym.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.220
You go for that.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.360
But that is the only differentiation.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.560
Actually it is the only one.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.320
In my opinion.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.060
Let us go to the last.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.460
They are the boutique gyms.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.300
They are growing in recent years.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.980
This at the end.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.300
It will be a step further.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.960
The area of the neighborhood gym.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.420
It will be something that will be different.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.560
Because it will offer.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.560
A very specific service.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.500
for example.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.320
Only pilates classes.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.940
Only yoga classes.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.460
Only cycle classes.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.120
There are people at the end.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.180
Going to the gym.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.240
In a chain like ours.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.980
Only go.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.620
To enjoy a service.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.080
It can be a specific

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.660
activity.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.900
It could be Zumba or anything.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.080
This is what they will do.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.920
Specialize in that.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.580
Employing the best professionals

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.740
in the sector.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:15.780
In that.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.740
Creating experiences every time

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.100
you go.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.360
That you probably won't.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.400
In a gym for a lifetime.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.200
It is true that at the end.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.200
There are many.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.740
They are looking for something very specific.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.800
They are very professional.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.880
This is explained perfectly.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.460
From the generic strategies.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.240
Michael Porter, who was the author.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.320
The first gyms.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.380
They play differentiation.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.420
Invest in everything.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.760
The bestial experiences.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.560
The low cost gym.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.000
What they do is.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.440
Reducing the investment.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.100
In many factors.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.520
As for the premium.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.840
But thanks.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.760
A huge economy of scale.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.300
You are competitive.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.460
You are getting better.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.860
You can.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.340
Investing in personnel.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.640
You have better machines.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.580
The economy of scale is very important.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.300
Then there are the gyms.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.860
They are competing in the niche strategy.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.740
Let the people go.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.800
Because what they want is that.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.980
I want to box.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.440
I want to go to a place.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.380
Let him have that.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.540
Because they will offer it to me.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.860
Boxing is better.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.920
That is the key.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.220
It is clear.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.520
And then they are.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.400
I think we've done stacking the middle.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.880
The shockers.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.780
Those who are in the middle.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.400
They have prices.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.460
More expensive than yours.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.380
They do not have the machinery.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.120
They have the premium.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.800
He is in a complicated situation.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.320
This is the picture of the sector.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.980
Totally agree.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.280
and totally.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.880
Nothing is.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.960
A lot thanks.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.280
We will talk again.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.320
Because I have thousands of questions.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.400
Thanks to you.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.820
You know I am available.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.180
For what you want.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.560
Many thanks.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.700
and an embrace.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:10.920
Until then.
