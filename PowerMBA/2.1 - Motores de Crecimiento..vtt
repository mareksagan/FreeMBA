00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.560
I would like you to understand

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.680
the concept of growth engine well.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.720
The most valuable thing would be that

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.080
you could analyze the company and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.060
understand how it grows, what is

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.660
the main engine of that company.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.700
Let us start with the definition.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.080
I like to define

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.820
it as the engine.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.960
It is the mechanism, like any engine,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.340
that helps you, that pushes

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.820
you, that helps you grow.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.660
And you also have to do it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.840
sustainably, that is, this will

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.680
not grow on time, because you

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.220
could, for example, invest

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500
and do an action in medium

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.800
and good, capture many

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.120
customers on time and grow.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.380
But we don’t talk about that, we talk

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.500
about a motor, we talk about something

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.220
that pushes you and also that has

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.000
to function like a virtuous circle.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.720
The Lean Startup book defines

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.880
three types of growth engines.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.860
Companies can usually

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.480
fit within one of them,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.620
mainly.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.100
What happens is that this is actually

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.640
a classification that isn’t usually

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.060
pure, that is, a company can have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.280
something from several engines.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600
But it helps a lot to use this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840
model to understand each company

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.020
what is its main growth engine,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.520
because from that we will

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.280
allow it to be managed better.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.240
Because we will know what metrics

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.460
we need to use and above all we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.200
will know what we need to focus

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.160
on to give momentum to that engine.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120
We go with the three.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.560
The first is the payment.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.920
How does a company work with

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.100
this type of growth engine?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.320
Well, because they are companies

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.020
that invest heavily in attracting

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.100
new customers.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.540
What happens is that the customer

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.140
lifetime value, what they get for

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.580
each customer is much higher or should

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.340
be much higher than the investment

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.220
they make.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.040
So they get a high margin and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.320
that margin what they do is

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.680
reinvest it heavily in a greater

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
customer capture.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720
This is possible, that is, this

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.280
engine allows you to grow a lot

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.980
when your margin is very high

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500
and also when you recover the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.760
investment in a short time,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.360
which is the CAC payback.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.360
If you have these two factors, then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.060
imagine, I’ll put you a case.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.940
Think of a company that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.720
sells e-books and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.020
sells them for 100 euros.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.020
And capturing a customer costs you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.180
10 and also has no marginal

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.180
cost because the e-book

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.100
already has it amortised and already

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.000
has it created.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.920
So, you get a margin of 90.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.320
And invest today and sell the book in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.280
a maximum period of one month, that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.840
is, you turn 10 euros into 100 in

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.540
a month.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.940
With those 90 of margin, you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.020
can reinvest the next month

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.960
and with those 90 as the cost

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.160
of acquiring customers are 10,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.940
you can sell 9 more, that is,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.080
you get 900 euros more.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.740
We are talking about a growth

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.380
curve that is really exponential.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.840
What should you focus on if

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.320
your company has this growth

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.180
engine primarily?

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.100
What you have to do is optimize

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.960
that rest, that is, increase the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.960
CAC and reduce the cost of customer

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.120
acquisition as much as possible.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.240
You also have to have a very

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.600
aggressive reinvestment policy.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.980
Any example?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.360
I think Hawkers is a very clear

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.400
example of this.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.500
Hawkers sells their glasses

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.280
with a very high margin that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.960
allows them to reinvest those

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.880
margins in more marketing,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.220
mainly digital marketing

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800
and influencer marketing.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.320
This has made him very attractive.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.020
And I think this is the reason

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.220
why companies have been born

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.180
that can have a growth

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.320
engine quite similar to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.040
Hawkers.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.280
For example, we have a company

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.120
that sells low cost watches that,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.440
thanks to the margin they

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.820
get, are watches that cost, imagine,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.920
75 euros.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.880
They have a very high margin.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.400
That allows them to reinvest

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.380
in marketing, allows them to quickly

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.680
reach a certain volume of business.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.580
The second of the growth engines

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.520
is very different because here

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.420
in this case these companies

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.880
are not obliged to invest in

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.060
cost of acquiring customers.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.560
Instead of your product, your service

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.000
is spreading with a virus all over the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.960
world.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.340
Because your customers get new customers.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.300
This has a lot of implications

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.060
for the business model.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.680
One of them is to remember the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.420
balance between customer left value

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.840
and customer acquisition cost.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.420
For example, in the case of a customer

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.400
left value, the customer

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.160
left value is lower.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
In addition, you can allow to monetize little

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.640
to each customer because it has cost

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.580
them very little to capture it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.220
In addition, in some cases they

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.720
are encouraged to do so because

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.560
it is easier to grow your product.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.620
For example, with a freemium model

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.480
your product if customers do

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.240
not have to pay.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.620
What do you have to focus on?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.060
The virus is spreading.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.920
You need to focus on your customers

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.480
being encouraged to share

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.120
it with others.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.560
You have to focus on making your

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.320
product as viral as possible, etc.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.780
And the examples?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.500
Hotmail is a good example of

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.080
a viral product or Facebook.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.500
Both meet the requirements

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.520
we have seen.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.240
They have grown like viruses all over the world.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.820
The cost of capture has been very low.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.660
They have not had to invest

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.020
heavily in user acquisition,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.060
traditional advertising

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.960
mind, etc.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.100
It is the customers who

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.400
have brought them new

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.220
customers.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.680
Now, we go to the last model.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.660
This model is called Sticky in English

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.140
and the literal translation from

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.200
Spanish is sticky that sounds

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.140
maybe a bit weird.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.420
These are companies where the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.940
key is engagement, the key

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.620
is retention.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.300
The key is that customers are

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.640
customers for a long time.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.260
They obviously have to make an

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.640
effort to capture new customers.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.300
And they will have to invest

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.040
in capturing new customers, obviously.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.380
But it doesn’t really work like the

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.460
first model we’ve seen from the backpack.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.160
In this case, it works in a different way.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.580
The main thing you have to do is not

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.640
lose customers.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.840
At least what you have to focus

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.060
on is that the ratio of highs is

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.220
greater than the ratio of lows.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.440
You will understand it with examples.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.180
and gym.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.040
A gym comes at a time when it reaches

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.820
a stable level of partners.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.160
What you really need to focus on

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.800
is not losing them.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.620
Because if you didn’t lose any, which

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.040
is something that obviously doesn’t

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.480
exist, you’t have to spend money on

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.520
capturing customers.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.880
But if you lose 40% of your customers

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.220
every year, you have to invest

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.540
in advertising, in customer

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.420
acquisition to recover

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.300
that rate.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.760
And really here what happens

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.280
is that in a gym will reach

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.480
a saturation point, but in

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.160
scalable companies the saturation

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.900
point comes much later.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.200
Let’s think of a company like

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.560
Tulotero, for example.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.660
In Tulotero the key is that the

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.000
ratio of altas is greater than the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.360
ratio of lows.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.080
Why is?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.760
Because probably the customers, the

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.560
players in Tulotero will be players

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.420
for their entire life or for

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.100
many years they are used

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.980
to playing in Tulotero.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.720
And the ratio of drops, the chant

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720
rate, is very, very, very low.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.680
So simply with you being able to

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.760
make your ratio of highs higher

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.240
than the ratio of downs, you

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.600
will grow very sustainably.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.880
Here is the mechanism.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.340
The last example is Netflix.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.980
Netflix works in a similar way.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.840
In this case it is a subscription

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.640
service, just like the gym,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.800
not like in Tulotero, which are

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.260
punctual purchases, but what Netflix

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
has to encourage is engagement.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.360
It is the recurrence of use, it is

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.820
that you never get off, it is that you

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.020
are very happy with the service so

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.020
that you never get off.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.160
And then there comes a time when the

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.660
cost of customer acquisition is something

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.420
that is almost irrelevant.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.380
If you’ve been a Netflix customer

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.640
for 20 years, the day we’ve

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.900
been a Netflix customer for 20

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.620
years, what Netflix has spent

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.620
on capturing us is totally irrelevant.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.560
In this case, the most important

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.000
ratio is retention.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.360
and thanks!
