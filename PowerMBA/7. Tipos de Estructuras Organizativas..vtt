00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.440
The difference between hierarchy

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.580
and plan is a very simple concept.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.040
Hierarchies are more vertical,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.640
there are more levels or ranges

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.900
between management and employees

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.040
from below and planes

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.100
is the opposite.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.200
What I want us to understand is what

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.120
the benefits are or when it makes

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.520
sense to one or the other.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.000
In principle, the hierarchies

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.220
help us to be more efficient

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.160
because we function like a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.640
clock or as a factory.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.620
The mechanism is well defined.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400
So, this when you are in an environment

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.480
in which there is no uncertainty,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.400
in which the only thing you have

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
to do is what you do today, that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.720
it is all very repetitive, that

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.420
you do not need to innovate,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.420
etc., can make sense a hierarchical

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.340
structure that also provides

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.000
you with a lot of control,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.080
etc.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.620
What it brings is efficiency

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.340
because clear how the parts

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.900
work very well is very efficient

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.340
in everything.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.560
Get the results you already

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240
know in a way that you absolutely

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.480
have proven.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.420
But what we have to keep in mind

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.500
is that the markets, the world

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.000
in general is increasingly dynamic,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500
it is increasingly difficult for

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.780
you to be competitive being

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.640
a very hierarchical or very

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.900
vertical organization.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.060
Because it is very difficult to innovate,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.480
because it is very difficult, because you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.960
are a very unflexible people.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.080
Now let's look at the horizons

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.240
and the plans.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.880
In this case, it is the opposite.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.160
If you want to be able to adapt

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.820
to change, to put in place many

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.180
projects, to have an organization,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760
a culture that is more creative,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.940
well because in these cases

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.140
it is much better that you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.740
are more horizontal because

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520
information flows better,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.120
because people are more

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.660
motivated, etc.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340
In this case, we should combine the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.320
structure with a culture in which

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.180
there is a lot of autonomy, a lot

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.860
of flexibility, etc.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.260
That is what we have studied that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.340
is called adocracy.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.200
Another advantage and very important

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.640
to keep in mind of the structures

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.420
that are more flat is that the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.140
entire organization is closer

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.640
to the customer.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.520
It is easier to be client-centered.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.280
I will put it to you with an example.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.820
Let's think of a people who have

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.600
a relationship with the customer,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.700
imagine the customer service

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.940
or imagine the commercial delegates.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.240
They are the ones who have a daily relationship

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.640
with the customer.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.560
Getting feedback, etc.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.280
Those who know him.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100
But it is that information if

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.320
it has to reach those who make the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.180
decisions, imagine then that it is

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.540
the general manager or the director

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.320
of marketing or the commercial

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.120
director, etc.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.440
If there are many levels the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.200
information does not flow and in the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.420
end what happens is that the people

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.880
who are up making the important decisions

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.560
do not know the client.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.040
And this is a nonsense because knowing

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.320
and understanding the customer well is

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.120
the basis of absolutely everything.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.440
Therefore, if we want to be very

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.760
close to the customer, if we want

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.340
the people who make decisions

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.600
to be, know, understand the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.760
customer's problems, objections

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.380
that arise, etc.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.560
How are the customers?

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.320
We have to be a much more flat

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.060
structure in which there are fewer

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.440
levels and in which communication

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.500
from above down and from below

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.620
up is encouraged.
