WEBVTT

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.970
I would like you to be an expert

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.230
in the business model of platforms

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.950
that understands very well

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.350
what the differences with

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.430
a linear model are, what the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.430
implications it has.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.730
Because as I said, as I say

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.990
many times, platforms are

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.270
recurring all sectors, that

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.770
is, it is convenient that we

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.290
understand why, right?

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.490
I'll share with you four conclusions

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.190
about the differences

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.150
between a more scalable platform

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.390
and a business.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.710
It's much easier to grow with

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170
rising returns if your business

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.350
model is a platform

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.490
that is a linear model.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.450
You will understand it very easily.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.170
I'll compare you to Marriott

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.030
with Airbnb, which are

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.790
that might be competitors in

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.310
some way.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.250
Marriott is a hotel chain.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.190
If Marriott wants to grow, what

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670
it has to do is invest in the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.110
assets that are hotels and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.690
staff.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.770
If you open a new hotel, you have

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.690
to make a huge investment, right?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.010
If you want to grow around

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130
the world, then imagine

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.730
the capital needs you have

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.050
to cover, huge investments.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.330
Airbnb is the platform

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.730
that has already created it.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.910
So if you want to grow globally,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.350
your model is much more scalable

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.730
because you don't have to make

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.590
permanent additional investments.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.490
It would be the same comparison

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.470
as if we compare a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.690
taxi company in operation

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.690
with Uber.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.630
would be the same.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.490
The taxi company would have to buy

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.910
more cars and more licenses and Uber

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.250
doesn't have to do so, because

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.970
the platform is a resource,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.770
as I say, scalable.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.370
The first conclusion is that they are

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.990
more scalable.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.210
The second conclusion is that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.830
I want you to know that it is giving

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.130
an effect that they call The Winner

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.430
Takes It All.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.870
The winner takes everything.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.310
What is happening in many sectors

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.390
is that one, two or maybe three

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.830
platforms are doing with

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.210
the entire market.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.650
If we look for examples, we will

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.090
see that it is always so.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.150
This is due to the network effect.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.170
Let me see if I can

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.010
pass it well.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.410
This is because the first platforms

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.810
that gain traction, which start

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.390
to catch speed, keep in mind

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.970
that a vicious circle occurs,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.410
because the more users you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.650
have, the more value you bring.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.430
And by bringing more value, that allows

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.070
you to capture more users,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.350
virtuous circle.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.990
A virtuous circle is generated

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.750
that helps you or helps

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.930
the first platforms to catch

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.670
traction, speed, to gain

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.870
momentum and somehow barren the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.950
others.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.950
Because the others are not able to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.810
bring the value of the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.870
platforms that are winning the game.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.370
In the end, they become monopolies.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.750
This is true of social media,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.730
such as Facebook.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.810
Tucson is a case.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
Tuenti is true that it grew up

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.550
in Spain, but then Facebook's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.830
growth worldwide was devastating

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.970
and devastated them

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.370
all.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.370
Social media is very small

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.230
and is all around the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.910
world.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.110
Another conclusion, another difference,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.530
another very important implication

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.870
of a platform's business model,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.990
and this is very important

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.150
to keep in mind, is that the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.590
barriers to entry are much

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.010
larger.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.070
And that is the main reason

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.790
they are more valued.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.710
A platform has greater entry

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.850
barriers than a linear business,

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.950
always.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.070
This is also due to the network effect.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.690
This is because the established platforms,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.070
which have gained critical mass,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.430
think for example in a marketplace

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.450
like Amazon or eBay, for example,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.330
which they already have, or

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.610
as an immovable portal,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.130
which already have a lot of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.130
critical mass both in the supply

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.710
and in the demand.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.900
Having reached all that critical mass

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.270
allows them to generate enormous

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.270
value because they are adding

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.930
the entire market.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.250
Well, now tell me how a potential

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.930
competitor comes from scratch

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.950
to, say, take the quota

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.930
from the platforms

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.390
that are already deployed.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.090
It is very difficult, it is very difficult

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.130
because the one that starts from zero does

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.010
not bring any value.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.910
This is different in a linear business.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.930
In a linear business, you bring

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.150
value from the first customer

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.070
to the last and the same value.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.270
Let's go back to the example of

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.710
Marriott versus Airbnb.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.670
Airbnb's business has a lot

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.850
of bigger entry barriers

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.050
than Marriott's.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.390
You can compete with Marriott

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.490
perfectly.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.570
Marriott has a hotel, you open a

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.250
nearby hotel that is a little better,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.770
a little cheaper, whatever it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.310
is, and you'll earn market share.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.910
You're going to steal customers from Marriott.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.750
There is almost no entrance barrier.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.210
Much or much lower.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.950
In the case of Airbnb, the entry

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.710
barrier is huge because it adds

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.550
to the global range all the supply

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.630
and demand for housing, urban

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.730
accommodation, holiday accommodation.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.630
It is much more protected, so

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.390
the business is much more valuable.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.630
On the other hand, in a negative

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.690
way.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.070
This is when you want to create

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.090
a zero platform.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.390
When you want to create a zero

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.250
platform you don't have users,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.750
neither on one side nor on the other.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.990
This is called the egg and

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.690
chicken challenge, where to start.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.210
This is a huge difficulty you

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.410
have to consider if you are going

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.550
to build a platform.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.170
It is a huge challenge.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.790
In addition to the entry barrier, in addition

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.250
to there being a competitor that is

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.470
already implanted and that is generating

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.530
a huge value and you start from

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.170
scratch and you have very difficult

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.970
to compete with him.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.110
In addition to that, you have the problem

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.950
that, and it is also generated by

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.990
the Network Effect, that when there

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.890
are no users you do not bring value.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.490
If you don't add value, you can't

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.370
capture users.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.970
In this case, it is not a virtuous

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.470
circle that helps you grow, it is a vicious

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.570
circle that prevents you from growing.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.530
You think you are running a dating

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.230
network, for example, like Tinder

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.910
or Happen, and you don't have users

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.370
yet, you don't have boys or girls.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.710
You can't get more users, you

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.770
can't get more users.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.150
This is, as we said, a network

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.190
effect.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.770
There are no users, there is no value.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.430
This is something that many

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.690
entrepreneurs should take into account

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.570
because I have met people who are,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.770
even in the present time,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.170
are trying to undertake creating

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.830
platforms or marketplaces, without

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.310
having valued this, this difficulty

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.650
that they will find, of the egg and

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.990
chicken or of the Network Effect,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.490
that when you are big benefits

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.170
you because your business is very

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.890
much worth, but until you reach that

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.190
critical mass is that your business

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.030
is very complicated and in addition

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.650
to grow you will need a lot

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.570
more money, a lot more money

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.890
than if you mount a linear

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.890
business, imagine that

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.750
if you mount an e-commerce.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.790
You run an e-commerce and want to

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.970
sell, because I don't know, shoes.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.870
Well, because with the first

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.770
shoe you sell to the customer you

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.070
bring value, earn money, have

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.670
a margin and good, because it can

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.470
allow you to continue growing,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.750
finance your growth, etc.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.530
But if you set up a marketplace,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.470
imagine, I put you a marketplace where

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.870
you add the sellers and buyers shoes

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.130
in the world until you have thousands

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.170
of sellers and thousands of buyers,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.390
you do not bring value to anyone,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.770
neither the seller nor the buyer,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.690
you understand the difference,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.010
then the difficulty is much larger

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.470
and you need a lot more money because

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.650
you have to finance all that

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.270
bestial growth on both sides

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.810
and you also have to finance

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.570
the fact that at first you

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.490
will not be able to bring

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.610
value, your margins will

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.970
be super low, you will

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.050
not be able to monetize, etc.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.330
Therefore, it is something that

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.990
business managers with who are

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.590
with that have a platform business

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.910
model should consider.
