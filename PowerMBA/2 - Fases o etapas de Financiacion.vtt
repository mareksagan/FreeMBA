WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
In the course we have seen that there are four phases in the development of the product or

00:11.840 --> 00:17.440
business model that we have called product solution feed, which are the first experiments,

00:17.440 --> 00:22.960
product market feed, which is when you already have an MVP and you have validated that it generates a certain value,

00:22.960 --> 00:28.240
that there are clients who pay for it, etc. Then you validate the growth channels and the last

00:28.240 --> 00:33.280
phase would be the expansion phase, international growth or whatever, there are many companies that do not arrive.

00:33.280 --> 00:40.480
To move forward, in many cases, financing is needed, it is necessary that they help you with funds,

00:40.480 --> 00:47.680
with foreign funds and I would like you to explain to us how the phases are from the perspective of

00:47.680 --> 00:53.240
the development of the product and how they are from the perspective of financing, what they are called, who

00:53.240 --> 01:00.640
you have to resort to in each phase, etc. Well, the nomenclatures of the phases vary a lot,

01:00.640 --> 01:07.160
that is, it is not something that is established, as well as in the United States the names of the phases are very clear

01:07.160 --> 01:12.680
and they correspond to certain quantities, in Spain, probably due to the

01:12.680 --> 01:19.800
immaturity of the ecosystem, we still call a round of 500,000 euros or a round of 100 million euros.

01:19.800 --> 01:26.640
So the names that we are going to see are all orientative, but as you said, being very

01:26.640 --> 01:33.080
associated with the stages of growth, of product development, it is what will serve as a guide.

01:33.080 --> 01:40.760
The first stage is the phase in which it is called seed phase or seed capital, which is in the one

01:40.760 --> 01:47.040
related to the product in which we are developing that product, we are first checking that

01:47.120 --> 01:53.120
product, because we are able to develop it and that it solves a problem. This is when

01:53.120 --> 01:58.560
someone has an idea, the first steps, we call it, from the product, from the business,

01:58.560 --> 02:03.520
it is product solution feed, from the point of view of financing, it is seed.

02:03.520 --> 02:10.880
Exactly, it would be seed capital or seed financing. The ideal in this case is to do it with our own resources,

02:10.880 --> 02:16.720
that is, the first thing we have to see is what is our minimum viable product and how long

02:16.720 --> 02:20.840
it will take or how much money we will need to develop it and this will depend on the type of

02:20.840 --> 02:26.440
business model we want to do, because obviously if we are doing a more technological project

02:26.440 --> 02:30.800
or something of blockchain, artificial intelligence that needs a longer development, the

02:30.800 --> 02:35.760
development periods of this MVP will be longer, but the normal or ideal would be that we could

02:35.760 --> 02:41.520
develop a minimum viable product with our own resources and even in our free time.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.680
The recommendation here is when, because this is also a situation in which many people are seen,

02:46.680 --> 02:50.760
when we talk about the later stages, they are already larger companies, more professionalized,

02:50.760 --> 02:56.120
that have more help, but this has happened to many people, they have an idea, they are working

02:56.120 --> 03:01.000
on a foreign account, for example, and I know that there are people who seem to wait for the

03:01.000 --> 03:05.040
business angel to come or for the fund to come and what they have is an idea in a powerpoint,

03:05.160 --> 03:11.200
so the recommendation that we usually give is the first steps as you said, give them the

03:11.200 --> 03:16.960
first stage of financing that you have called it, do it with your money or with money from very close people

03:16.960 --> 03:22.000
because the risk is so high that a business angel is not going to trust you that you are

03:22.000 --> 03:28.960
working elsewhere with a powerpoint. Just, that is, five years ago, still 5, 6, 7 years ago, it

03:28.960 --> 03:34.480
was still viable because the volume of projects was much less, getting financing or

03:34.480 --> 03:38.800
capital seed only with a powerpoint, but today with the number of people who are

03:38.800 --> 03:44.360
doing very well done things, as you well commented, it is a matter of risk and the business

03:44.360 --> 03:49.040
angels or the most professional investors prefer to enter a little more advanced stages,

03:49.040 --> 03:56.200
especially because if you do not trust your idea enough how to leave your job or

03:56.200 --> 04:01.840
dedicate your time to it, dedicate your money to it, you are asking them to risk their money in

04:02.160 --> 04:05.680
something in which you do not trust enough. Yes, because you have not shown anything yet,

04:05.680 --> 04:12.520
you have not shown anything, as you said, five years ago or ten years ago, perhaps in a different ecosystem

04:12.520 --> 04:17.280
in which you still have a good idea, you made a powerpoint, you went to the market and convinced

04:17.280 --> 04:23.320
someone, but today, as you have said sometime, quoting Kaviedes, you were talking about the first 10

04:23.320 --> 04:29.280
invoices, if you are able to demonstrate something, if you have been able to issue 10 invoices and 10

04:29.280 --> 04:35.520
customers have been paid, the risk perception by a potential investor is much lower than if

04:35.520 --> 04:40.320
what we have is a piece of paper saying four ideas that, as we have seen in other occasions,

04:40.320 --> 04:43.920
in most cases the four ideas never end up becoming a business model.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.240
Also at this stage, at the stage in which you have to be 100% focused on developing

04:48.240 --> 04:54.720
your minimum viable product, the focus is fundamental, so if I dedicate part of my attention

04:54.720 --> 04:59.920
or part of my focus to the search for capital, I will be distracting myself from the important thing

04:59.920 --> 05:04.320
and what I have to do at that moment, which is to validate that the problem that I have detected

05:04.320 --> 05:09.680
exists and that the solution that has occurred to me solves it. Great, so first phase,

05:09.680 --> 05:14.240
from the point of view of the business, you have to do just what you have said and from the

05:14.240 --> 05:20.480
point of view of financing, our recommendation is to do it with your own resources, with your money

05:20.960 --> 05:29.120
or with the Friends, Families and Pools, but carefully. If you are doing a blockchain or

05:29.120 --> 05:34.320
artificial intelligence move or even something else in the world of health or scientific research

05:34.320 --> 05:41.760
and that development of that MVP is something a little longer, it may make sense to look for

05:41.760 --> 05:47.920
an incubator or even a business angel specialized in that vertical that, in addition to money,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.280
can provide you with know-how, contacts, can open doors, that is, more than money in this phase,

05:53.280 --> 05:58.640
the important thing is people who provide you with their experience or provide you with their network of contacts.

05:58.640 --> 06:04.480
Okay, but that's only if they are projects with a very high potential, if you also know how to sell well, etc.

06:04.480 --> 06:13.520
In general, in almost all projects, what are the first steps with your...

06:13.520 --> 06:20.320
If it is not a technologically hyper complicated project or put in the most scientific world of research,

06:20.320 --> 06:24.320
you should be able to do it in your free time with your own resources.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.720
That is, and do not be blocked by waiting for someone to come to solve things for you.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.920
That's it. Okay, let's move on to the next phase, in which you have taken the first steps,

06:33.920 --> 06:40.160
the first 10 invoices, you already have a product, you have something that you can demonstrate,

06:40.160 --> 06:42.640
and who do you turn to at that moment?

06:42.640 --> 06:48.640
Well, this phase is usually called the early stage phase, and as you said, we already have an MVP,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.480
we already have a minimum viable product, we already have some first customers,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.360
and we are starting to generate the first metrics.

06:55.360 --> 07:03.360
With this, it makes sense and we already have more possibilities to go out looking for professional financing,

07:03.360 --> 07:08.560
which in this case would be, we go back to accelerators, we go back to incubators,

07:08.560 --> 07:13.680
we go back to the business angels, that the business angels, we remember that we had spoken that in addition to money,

07:13.680 --> 07:19.280
as they are usually a profile of entrepreneurs who have already been successful and have sold their companies,

07:19.280 --> 07:24.080
they can contribute more than money, they can also contribute know-how and their network of contacts,

07:24.080 --> 07:30.800
and in this phase we can even go to capital funds, venture capital,

07:30.800 --> 07:38.320
but remember that in this phase the objective is to get the first customers and measure everything to the satiety,

07:38.400 --> 07:42.800
that is, here I need to have metrics, which are metrics that are going to help me,

07:42.800 --> 07:46.800
as we will see in later classes, to get that money,

07:46.800 --> 07:51.440
that is, these metrics are going to help me to demonstrate that this minimum viable product that I have developed

07:51.440 --> 07:58.320
is capable of getting customers and the customers I get are so happy that they repeat and recommend it.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.880
Okay, so in this second phase, which you have called the early stage,

08:03.600 --> 08:09.360
although there are people like you, you have said this is not black and white and it can be denominated in different ways,

08:09.360 --> 08:14.800
in the United States they call it with other terminologies sometimes, etc.,

08:14.800 --> 08:19.600
but what is very important to understand is, and you will explain the subsequent phases later,

08:19.600 --> 08:24.480
as you demonstrate things, to explain it in a simple way, you validate things,

08:24.480 --> 08:29.200
you decrease the risk, the valuation of the company increases and you have to go,

08:29.520 --> 08:39.760
and you can access another investor profile, and in the early stage phase you have told us that it is easier to start with Omniscience Angel,

08:39.760 --> 08:44.080
you have told us about some venture capital, right?

08:44.080 --> 08:52.080
Exactly, although in phases, then within venture capital, there are venture capital that are more focused on these previous phases,

08:52.160 --> 08:59.440
in fact in Spain, most venture capital, in this phase, the normal thing, it also depends on the type of project,

08:59.440 --> 09:07.440
but it would be to raise between 150,000 and 250,000 euros, which would ideally be to allocate them to validate those capture channels.

09:07.440 --> 09:12.880
Once we have a product, the objective of this phase is to get all the metrics, we have to know,

09:12.880 --> 09:17.520
as we talked about in the class of metrics, how much it costs me to get a client, when I am going to recover the investment,

09:17.520 --> 09:24.000
how much I am going to multiply it, and for that I need to have money to do tests, to test different capture channels.

09:24.000 --> 09:34.640
So, in Spain, this average ticket of 150,000, 200,000, 250,000 euros, you can find venture capital funds that provide it.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.440
The thing gets a little more complicated when we need higher tickets in later phases,

09:39.440 --> 09:45.360
and speaking of millions of euros, the financing funds we have in Spain are a little short.

09:46.080 --> 09:52.160
Indeed, another thing to take into account is that, as this is a process,

09:52.160 --> 09:56.880
and it is a process that is not the same for all companies, not in all places,

09:56.880 --> 10:00.240
but it is a process in which there are certain things that must be taken into account,

10:00.240 --> 10:06.160
and it is that, as I said, you are validating things, you are demonstrating things, the risk perceived by the market is increasingly lower,

10:06.160 --> 10:11.280
because you are demonstrating it, your company is worth more, and the rounds are getting bigger and bigger.

10:11.760 --> 10:19.200
That is, the first investment, as you said, you put it, well, you put the money you can, usually, right?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.880
The one they leave you.

10:20.880 --> 10:26.640
Bernardo Hernandez told us that he recommended for a year and a half, but hey, you still have it, you still have less money,

10:26.640 --> 10:31.280
that is, for less time, sorry. Early stage, the next round, you were already talking about larger quantities,

10:31.280 --> 10:34.960
you were talking about 150,000, well, maybe there are models that need 500,000, I don't know,

10:34.960 --> 10:37.840
but what you have to take into account is that more and more.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.480
Exactly.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.600
And the next phase, which is the phase of growth,

10:41.600 --> 10:44.560
which now you explain to us what type of investor you can access,

10:44.560 --> 10:48.320
and the next one, which would be to create a global company, more and more money.

10:48.320 --> 10:48.960
Right.

10:48.960 --> 10:54.800
In the early phase, you can validate with 100, 200, 500,000 euros,

10:54.800 --> 10:58.960
well, hey, let's validate that Facebook works as a capture channel,

10:58.960 --> 11:02.720
you can do little projects with 2,000, 3,000 euros,

11:02.720 --> 11:07.680
but if what I have to validate is that my product can also be bought in Latin America,

11:07.680 --> 11:11.520
you don't validate that with 2,000 euros, we are already talking about larger quantities.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.960
We are already talking about the next phase, perhaps, in the development of the product,

11:14.960 --> 11:17.040
which would be to validate.

11:17.040 --> 11:23.520
Let's make a case, we have already validated that we have a product that we like,

11:23.520 --> 11:26.720
and you already know how much it costs you to capture on Facebook,

11:26.720 --> 11:29.920
you already know how much you get, more or less, because you have certain metrics,

11:29.920 --> 11:32.480
and now what you want, as you said, is to grow in Latin America,

11:32.480 --> 11:36.560
or grow in the United States, we are in the phase that we have to validate the expansion,

11:36.560 --> 11:40.400
we have to validate that what we have, we have shown here that it is a good business,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.520
that anyone can do it, because we have metrics and because we can show it to anyone,

11:43.520 --> 11:47.920
and now we have to validate the expansion, who do we resort to, and why do you matter?

11:47.920 --> 11:52.800
Before that expansion, we have the growth phase,

11:52.800 --> 11:57.040
that in this growth phase, what we have to do is optimize these channels,

11:57.040 --> 12:01.680
once we have verified that, hey, this product sells very well on Instagram,

12:01.680 --> 12:03.920
but through Facebook, it works regularly for us,

12:03.920 --> 12:06.880
and the influencers work very well for us, for example,

12:06.880 --> 12:11.600
there what we need is gasoline to show that we are able to scale it,

12:11.600 --> 12:16.320
because there is a term that is the early adopters,

12:16.320 --> 12:24.480
then in many models it happens that the first 100, 150, 200 users are relatively easy to achieve,

12:24.480 --> 12:27.280
but there comes a point when I start to put money in,

12:27.280 --> 12:32.160
and the more money I start to put in, suddenly my acquisition costs start to rise,

12:32.160 --> 12:37.120
especially when they are very visionary products, or very new, or we are creating a market,

12:37.120 --> 12:41.600
then this is something that also usually creates fear and insecurity for investors,

12:41.600 --> 12:42.880
because they have seen it many times,

12:42.880 --> 12:49.280
then before letting you go to wider expansions or opening new verticals,

12:49.280 --> 12:54.320
they want to see what happens with your acquisition cost when you start to put a lot more money in marketing.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.720
In this phase, in this growth phase, it begins to make sense, for example,

12:58.720 --> 13:01.920
this that we talked about in previous classes, to make a media for equity,

13:01.920 --> 13:10.560
there are times when I make media for equity agreements before having validated the capture channels,

13:10.560 --> 13:14.400
before having validated that my product is really an attractive product,

13:14.400 --> 13:20.960
that it is attractive for more than those 100, 150, 200 people who are our early adopters,

13:20.960 --> 13:23.680
and that it allows me to grow over time,

13:23.760 --> 13:28.320
so when we see, we are satisfied that we can start to climb,

13:28.320 --> 13:31.360
here the business angels no longer stop being able to enter,

13:31.360 --> 13:36.320
because when I have to put money in seriously and overcome that barrier of being early adopters,

13:36.320 --> 13:38.720
we are already talking about investments of millions of euros,

13:38.720 --> 13:42.560
and here we would go to what in Spain we call a series A,

13:42.560 --> 13:46.320
which are already financing rounds, in which we are already talking about millions of euros,

13:46.320 --> 13:50.160
in which it is already almost exclusive territory of venture capital,

13:50.160 --> 13:53.760
and in which it may make sense to make a media for equity.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.880
Indeed, and it is a very interesting topic, the one you have commented,

13:56.880 --> 14:00.480
there are times when you go to the market and at the beginning you sell,

14:00.480 --> 14:05.520
it is like you enter with a knife, because there is a percentage of people in society

14:05.520 --> 14:11.520
that your proposal fits them very well, but you don't know that knife how far it will go,

14:11.520 --> 14:14.800
you don't know what your crystal ceiling is, because maybe there are four crazy people,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.080
and then you dimension the whole company,

14:18.080 --> 14:21.280
thinking that instead of four crazy people there are four million crazy people and there are only four,

14:21.280 --> 14:25.040
then you receive a lot of money, you make a media for equity, whatever it is,

14:25.040 --> 14:27.920
and it is that you do not sell more than four because your product does not like more people,

14:27.920 --> 14:31.920
and that is why you said that investors are certain risk, that is, they are certain fear.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.760
Exactly, and also the good thing is that as an ecosystem,

14:35.760 --> 14:43.920
Spain is also advancing a lot and we are all learning from different generations of entrepreneurs,

14:44.240 --> 14:48.480
so once this phase is over, we would move on to the expansion phase,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.320
in the expansion phase, which is one of the most critical phases,

14:52.320 --> 14:55.200
because here we have already validated that we have a product,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.520
we have validated the problem that we identified at the beginning,

14:57.520 --> 15:00.240
we have validated that the product that we have designed solves it,

15:00.240 --> 15:05.600
we have validated that we are able to capture clients for this product

15:05.600 --> 15:07.840
and we have validated that this knife reaches the bottom,

15:07.840 --> 15:11.280
that is, not only that we are able to go beyond those four crazy people,

15:11.680 --> 15:14.480
once we have this validated, it is when we say,

15:14.480 --> 15:18.000
hey, we are going to move on to other countries,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.200
we are going to expand either in markets or vertically,

15:21.200 --> 15:23.840
we are doing something in the world of animals, for example,

15:23.840 --> 15:27.840
because now we are moving on to the world of babies, which could be an example.

15:28.560 --> 15:34.880
In these phases, here we already talk about hundreds of millions or tens of millions of investments,

15:34.880 --> 15:37.760
and I want to open a whole continent and I want to do it well

15:37.840 --> 15:41.280
and I want to be able to compete with the competitors

15:41.280 --> 15:43.680
or with the people who are already doing the same in that market,

15:43.680 --> 15:45.600
because I need more money.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.800
Here comes a very interesting figure when it comes to investment,

15:48.800 --> 15:50.880
which are the industrial partners.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.800
The way startups work, this agile way of validating, iterating,

15:56.800 --> 15:58.960
testing things, failing quickly,

15:58.960 --> 16:00.960
makes a lot of sense in these initial phases,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.720
but when we get bigger and start opening countries,

16:04.720 --> 16:08.640
aligning with an industrial partner, with a bigger brother in our sector,

16:08.640 --> 16:12.400
can make sense because in addition to money, which obviously is good for us,

16:12.400 --> 16:16.240
it can give us know-how, open doors to markets

16:16.240 --> 16:19.760
that, due to our initial size, we have closed.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.240
I think the explanation is perfect.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.040
What I want to add is that very few people reach this phase.

16:25.040 --> 16:25.920
Very few.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
How many companies are there?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.440
Well, in the United States there are more,

16:29.440 --> 16:32.880
but how many companies in the rest of the world are there that raise rounds?

16:32.960 --> 16:35.200
We are talking about 50 million, which is very few.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.200
They count with their fingers.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
It can be one in every thousand, calmly.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.200
Yes, they count with their fingers.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.920
We do a wrap-up of the phases and, above all, who you go to.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.880
You start, the first steps, you call them the seed phase.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.000
In the seed phase, we ideally do it with our own resources,

16:54.000 --> 16:57.840
doing what we called bootstrapping in previous classes,

16:57.840 --> 16:59.200
friends, families and full,

16:59.360 --> 17:03.360
and only and exclusively in the case that developing our MVP

17:03.360 --> 17:07.200
is very long or very expensive because the technology is very specific,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.600
we would go to an incubator or a business angel.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.480
Perfect.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.600
Next phase, we have already shown, we have an MVP that starts to pull

17:15.600 --> 17:17.440
and we start to have metrics,

17:17.440 --> 17:21.280
but we need some money to validate it.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.080
Exactly.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.800
In this phase, in which we are validating our capture channels

17:24.800 --> 17:28.000
and we are validating the engagement that we generate with our users,

17:28.000 --> 17:33.040
here it can make sense to go to business angels or venture capital,

17:33.040 --> 17:37.440
but venture capital specialized in the investment of very early phases.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.800
That's it.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.760
Yes, because, as you said, there are venture capital that are willing to take more risks

17:41.760 --> 17:44.000
and others that enter later phases.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.240
Next phase, let's say we are trying to validate the expansion

17:48.240 --> 17:51.520
or optimize the channels and so on.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.680
In the growth phase, this is when we need the money almost by millions

17:55.680 --> 17:59.200
because we are validating that we are capable of these channels

17:59.200 --> 18:01.360
that we have already shown that work,

18:01.360 --> 18:04.400
pass that barrier of those four crazy ones that we mentioned

18:04.400 --> 18:07.360
and here we have to go to a media for equity

18:07.360 --> 18:09.600
or a venture capital in higher phases.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.720
Because we are already talking about millions.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.440
Yes, we are already talking about millions or even tens of millions.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.520
And then there is the last one, which you have called expansion,

18:15.520 --> 18:19.360
when you have 40, 30, 50 million, whatever,

18:19.360 --> 18:22.080
which is enough money to have a global company.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.520
Exactly, a global company.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.840
And here, in addition to venture capital,

18:25.840 --> 18:28.800
that in Spain there are few venture capital that can reach these quantities,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.760
we would have to go to venture capital and international,

18:31.760 --> 18:33.760
enter the industrial partners.
