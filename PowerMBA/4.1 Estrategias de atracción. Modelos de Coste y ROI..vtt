00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.090
We need to understand the concept

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.990
of ROI well, because it is one of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.350
the basic metrics in marketing and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.750
digital marketing.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.050
Why should we understand it?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.130
Well, because we have to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.890
be able to get what we are getting

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.750
from the marketing investment

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.270
we make.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.270
For the entire marketing plan, and

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.030
not only that, but also

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.590
we should know how to calculate

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.050
it for each of the channels or

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.290
investment alternatives we have,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.710
because so we can prioritize

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.730
or make decisions, etc.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.010
We have to know how much money

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.570
we are getting for every euro

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.690
we spend, it's pretty common

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.390
sense.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.170
The first thing I'll do is that you

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.610
understand how the picture of the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.790
reality of companies is, and that

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.970
we have many investment alternatives.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.090
Why is it?

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.530
Because we can invest in many different

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.870
channels, through different

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.690
platforms, with different

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.870
cost models, etc.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.910
I'll give you an example so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.070
you can get a little idea.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.490
Imagine, you can invest 50,000

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.630
euros in a TV campaign,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:24.930
which is OneShot.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510
Or we're investing in Facebook and it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.870
costing us the cost per click a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.250
little more expensive, at 7 euros,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.950
for example.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.130
Or we can encourage SEO,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.530
encourage Inbound Marketing

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.270
strategies, and in this case we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.350
hire an expert in SEO that costs

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.190
us company costs, with Social

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.590
Insurance, etc., costs us 6000

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.110
euros, which you also have to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.710
assign, because it is an investment

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.730
in marketing.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050
Well, as you can see, you have

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.290
many options with different

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.850
cost models, etc.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.490
So here the challenge is, the challenge

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.170
is several, that is, how will we

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.630
compare those investments?

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.970
How much is each of these investments

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.930
being made?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.790
We have to be able to calculate

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.350
it to prioritize, because it also

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.930
turns out that one of the channels

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.270
is not profitable, or there is another

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.490
that is much more profitable and

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.830
we should prioritize it.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.550
Well, what we have is, as we think

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.930
about the funnel, because

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.830
we have different formulas to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.950
generate traffic on the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.970
top with very different cost models.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.050
And what we have to do is, let's

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.710
see how to calculate the ROI

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.810
of each of them.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.270
We'll go to the ROI formula,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.670
which you should be

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.870
familiar with.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.230
What is the ROI?

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.150
ROI is the profit divided between

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.010
the investment.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.450
Well, what is the benefit?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.750
Because the profit is the additional

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.830
income that will generate less investment,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.830
which could be the gross margin,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.090
for example, well, there are

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.310
different ways to calculate

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.510
it, but basically the concept

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.410
is this.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.390
So we already have less

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.190
profit divided between investment.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.670
But let's bring this to the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390
terms of digital marketing we know.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.890
What are the additional income?

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.690
If we go down the funnel, it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.710
is the number of customers that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.890
will generate that campaign or that

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.050
plan, the number of additional

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.990
customers by the value that each

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.970
of those customers will generate.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.630
We'll capture 1,000 customers and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.850
each of them will generate

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.490
5,000 euros throughout their

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.590
lives, imagine.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.950
Customer lifetime

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.610
value.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.550
What is the investment?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.250
As you can see, it is in the numerator

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.050
and in the denominator.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.630
That is, if we calculate it in terms

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.770
of customers is very easy, it

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.030
is the number of customers we

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.690
have captured, so it has cost

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.870
us to capture each of those customers.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.890
By the way, we already have it, but we

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.610
already have the number of customers,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.210
customer lifetime value and customer

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.370
acquisition cost.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.270
There are times when we can use other

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.170
sizes, because instead of customer lifetime

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.850
value, imagine that instead of thinking

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.010
about the number of customers we

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.070
think about the number of transactions.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.070
Well, we would do the number of operations

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.110
by the average ticket of each

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.830
of those operations or sales.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.370
And as for the investment, what we

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.670
would consider is the number of sales

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.570
of operations so it has cost

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.190
us to generate that operation,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.110
which is the CPA, the cost per

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.970
acquisition.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.450
But well, after all, as you can see,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.490
it's the same concept, but it depends

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.810
a bit on the model.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.790
Well, let's go to the first.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.070
We know what the king is.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.150
The ROI at the end depends on

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.290
the number, depends on the customer

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.650
lifetime value, depends on the cost

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.910
of customer acquisition.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.950
But if you see it in the formula,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.530
we can actually take the number of

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.830
customers from the numerator and the nominee.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.970
Therefore, the ROI at the end of

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.810
the day depends on what each

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.470
of those customers generates and what

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.010
we have cost to capture them.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.150
It is easier to manage this, it is

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.770
easier to compare between the different

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.490
channels, between the different

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.610
investment alternatives if what

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.490
we are comparing are magnitudes

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.030
such as customer lifetime

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.510
value or as the cost of customer

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.390
acquisition.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.490
So we had the funnel, many investment

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.870
alternatives, but we have

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.230
to go down altogether.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.850
We have to go to the bottom of the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.290
funnel and calculate, is it worth it,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.450
how much it has cost us to capture

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.730
each of those customers and how much

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.670
it will generate us.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.090
By the way, there are many companies

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.350
that forget about how much they will generate,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.250
that they stay on the previous point

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.990
when they make the calculation, that

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.070
what they do is compare.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.230
I have a CAC of 10 on

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.430
Facebook and I have

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.610
a CAC of 15.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.010
But it is that you have to incorporate,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.390
as we have seen, the customer lifetime

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.830
value or the average ticket, the revenue

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.270
because it is possible that traffic

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.690
that comes from one channel or

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.170
another, from different origins,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.850
because in some cases they are

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.890
better customers who ultimately

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.730
buy more.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.850
You cannot lose that perspective.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.050
See also customer lifetime value

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.750
and customer acquisition cost.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.690
We start with the cost of

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.490
customer acquisition.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.170
What depends on?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.620
It depends.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.160
Up on the funnel depends on the

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.040
cost of traffic, how much it is costing

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.720
us to attract that traffic.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.220
And here sometimes, as you have seen,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.640
the cost model is different.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.340
In some cases it directly costs

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.340
a click, in other cases it costs

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.100
a thousand impressions, etc., but

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.500
we could equate it in terms of how

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.300
much each of the visits is costing us.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.940
Well, and the cost of acquiring

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.620
the customer does not depend only

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.960
on the cost of the visits, but depends

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.340
on the conversion ratio, of what

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.560
percentage we will get those

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.340
visits to become customers.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.000
Now we have the perspective.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
What is the cost of acquiring

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.280
a customer?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.480
Of the cost of traffic, of what

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.600
costs us up, and in addition to

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.040
what we are able to convert,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.340
of the conversion ratios.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.860
By the way, conversion

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.980
rates, as you can imagine,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.440
depend on the quality of

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.940
that traffic, not just

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.640
on us.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.220
That is, you should always keep

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.300
it very careful.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.220
When you compare different capture

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.420
channels, there are channels that

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.600
bring you more quality traffic

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.760
and others that bring you less

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.880
quality traffic.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.700
And those who have the highest quality

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.700
eventually turn more, because it

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.480
is people to whom your proposal fits best.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.840
Well, and now what we have to do

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.020
is the next step, to see what depends

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.280
on the Customer Lifetime

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.880
Value.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.400
Well, because the Customer Lifetime

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.600
Value also depends on the quality

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.640
of that traffic.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.540
If customers who come from a press

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.240
ad result that they are, that they

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.160
have much less quality and buy

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.460
much less, well, because something

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.560
we have to keep in mind.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.440
In conclusion, what we have to

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.020
do is make the final account, calculate

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.340
not only how much it will cost us

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.140
for each of those alternatives,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.420
how much it will cost us to

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.260
capture a customer, but also we

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.620
have to calculate how much value

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.920
we will generate that customer.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.700
And so we can already calculate the

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.620
ROI, and so we can already compare

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.160
the return that each of the investment

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.580
alternatives will offer us.
