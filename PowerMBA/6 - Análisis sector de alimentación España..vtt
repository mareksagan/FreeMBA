00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.500
I think the analysis we’re going

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
to do of the two news is interesting

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
because it will help you understand

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.680
better or at least visualize

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.400
something we’ve learned

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.740
in the previous classes.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040
Basically, as you know, we are

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.400
talking about a mature sector and

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.920
in the mature sectors it is usually

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.520
given a series of guidelines

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.360
or habitual trends such as

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.420
the increase in price

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.500
warfare, such as

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.300
concentration, scale economies,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.860
etc.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.740
We will look at the food industry

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.800
in Spain.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.580
We start with the first news,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.100
the battle for supermarket control.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.160
We will go back to the news and highlight

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.100
topics from which we will draw

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.420
conclusions.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.290
Well, as we see, he makes a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.970
comparative between the concentration

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.590
in the market of Portugal or the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.610
UK in which he speaks of being much

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.210
more concentrated, with 80 % of

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.450
the market share in the hands

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.990
of the large groups.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.390
In Spain, however, it seems that the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.890
large chains are distributed by 42%.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.690
Thus, the growth potential

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.490
of large chains, the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.510
trend will be towards greater

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.750
concentration.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.110
And here it gives us one of the keys

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.550
and it is the price war.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.070
The price war accelerates concentration

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.790
by a number of factors

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.370
that we will see later.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.110
Look what he says to us.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.290
Big players like Mercadona,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.390
Diaolide, have sources

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.310
of expansion plans.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.460
Within its strategic plan is to continue

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.860
to grow in Spain because there

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.000
is still a margin of

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.160
growth for these large groups

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.700
that only have a 40%.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340
Fijaros is a very mature sector where

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.840
it is difficult to take customers

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.500
away from your competitors.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.860
But it turns out that these large

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.200
groups have a very aggressive

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.140
expansion strategy.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.660
And let’s see how.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.440
Here is the growth strategy

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
of the day.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.580
We want to be the main

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.880
players in the consolidation of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880
a still very fragmented market.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.980
As you can see, there is still

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.880
potential for growth.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.740
And how do they do it?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.540
How does it do in this case?

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.360
It explains us.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.660
Compro has acquired Slacker

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.440
drug chain for more than $70 million.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.520
He also acquired the El Árbol

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.840
chain with 450 supermarkets and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780
made another acquisition of 146

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.760
supermarkets to Eroski.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.640
The growth strategy

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.400
is clear.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.820
What you are doing is buying your

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.760
competitors.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.620
This, as we say, implies or

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.640
impacts the concentration

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.620
of the market.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.220
If the adults are eating the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.600
kids, the concentration

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.420
is increasing.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.040
And in the course of growth strategies

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.820
that we will see later

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.580
you will learn, you will understand

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.360
very well what are the differences

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.240
between growing internally, which

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.500
in this case would be to open

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.980
more supermarkets or buy

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.220
from your competitors.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.220
It is an inorganic

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.380
growth strategy.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.100
Here he tells us.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.960
Buying from the competition, even if

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.960
it’s expensive, is the fastest way

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.780
to win customers.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.060
Obviously, it’s easier to grow

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.280
quickly if you buy from your

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.080
competitors than if you grow

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.240
internally.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580
And it seems that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.780
supermarkets, the big groups,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.720
have two models to grow.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.260
As I said, there are two models.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.860
The one of Dia, which we have already

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.760
seen, buys its competitors

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.260
or also grows through franchises.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.060
Mercadona and Lidl are

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.420
growing organically.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.740
Growing organically means growing

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.160
internally, that is, opening

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.120
new stores.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.680
Mercadona is planning to open 60 stores

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.400
in 2015.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.820
It is an old news, but it does

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.820
not serve.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.320
And the last thing I want us to see

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.020
and analyze in this news is how

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.820
competition works in such an environment.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.640


00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.220
We will see.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.080
Competition in a mature

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.980
market is usually fierce

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.220
and we add that there has

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.400
been a crisis in recent

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.560
years in Spain.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.580
So what is happening

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.000
in such a context?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.440
And here we have it very clear.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
In such a context, large companies,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.600
large chains have an advantage,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.060
have a competitive advantage.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.620
This is what we call economies of scale.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.980
We will look at this concept

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.060
in more detail later.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.720
What is the impact of

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.740
the economy in a sector

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.820
like food?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.840
Well, so very clearly.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.920
That by having a higher purchase

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.140
volume you can negotiate better

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.660
with suppliers.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.700
We go back to concentration.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.180
If we are in a market with a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.060
certain concentration, where the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.320
big ones have an enormous advantage

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.780
over the small ones because they

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.220
benefit from better costs, what

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.360
happens is that the concentration

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.980
will increase.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.680
The little ones will die or many

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.760
of the little ones will die

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.280
because you can’t compete being

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920
small in such a market.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.860
Although here it gives us a guide

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.380
and says, however, some small

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.560
operators have found a formula

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.460
to defend themselves.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.880
And how do they do it?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.780
How can the big ones defend themselves?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.500
through purchasing centers.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.300
They come together to buy.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.240
They try to counter that economy

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.560
of scale or that competitive advantage

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.460
that the big ones have by uniting.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.200
Let us make a quick summary of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.220
what we have seen in this news.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.160
As we see, the food sector

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.480
is in maturity and a huge price

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.860
war has been produced by a number

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.980
of factors, among other things,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.740
because there has been a

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.880
crisis for a few years, but

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.720
in itself competition generates

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.120
price war.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.980
What is happening in this context?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.740
Well, because it takes to be competitive,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.040
it takes to be very large,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.080
that’s what we call economies

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.800
of scale.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.180
Big people benefit from better

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.160
buying conditions and in

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.960
a sector like food

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.060
is vital.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.620
And what happens?

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.500
Well, because the big ones in

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.840
the end what they are doing is

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.100
either buying or growing internally,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.540
creating new supermarkets

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.440
or new points of sale and

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.640
the sector is concentrating.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.460
There are fewer and fewer,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.700
the small are smaller and

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.640
the big are bigger.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.520
The big fish eats the boy, right?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.820
What options do the kids have?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.100
They gave us some clues.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.400
What they can do, among other things,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.240
is to allied with each other

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.340
through purchasing centrals.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.400
Well, it’s an example in this

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.500
sector, but what I want you to be

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.660
clear is that in an environment

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.960
of this type, where there are economies

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.300
of scale, where it’s necessary

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.500
to have economies of scale,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.720
being small is complicated.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.160
But in mature markets we can

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.040
say that there is no space,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.400
there is no possibility of competing

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.480
being small.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.940
Well, because it is not so, it is not

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.440
so, there are other options, as we will

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.900
see.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.620
But usually what happens in mature

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.740
markets is that markets are concentrated

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.620
and in the end what remains

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.360
are very large competitors and

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.360
niche competitors, very differentiated

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.720
competitors.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.520
What do we mean with this?

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.080
This is also something we

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.340
will see later in the competitive

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.180
niche strategy.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.040
Well, if you compete with a very

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.360
different proposal, either because

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.340
it is very local or because it is

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.860
very specialized in luxury,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.840
etc., you can go to that niche,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.060
to that small part of the market,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.720
and in that niche be protected,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.420
not be so threatened by the

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.240
large groups.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.980
In the supermarket,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.420
I will give you an example.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.920
There are supermarkets that

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.500
are, say, prime supermarkets, luxury

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.600
supermarkets, gourmet

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.240
supermarkets, like Sánchez

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.840
and Romero.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.200
You will have your clientele.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.980
It is a niche, it is a small part of

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.440
the population, but they have their clientele.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.720
They are not competing with the

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.260
big groups, because they offer something

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.220
different.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.980
Or in the food sector, for example,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.100
we can have the small, convenience

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.160
stores, fisheries,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.080
carcasses, etc., with a

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.160
much more personalized

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.720
service, of much higher

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.340
quality.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.540
Of course, this is another niche.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.440
Or, for example, if you have a

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.380
proposal that has some very differential

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.960
value, a 711 store, a 24 hour

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.220
open store, well, then, let’

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.680
s say that you are coming

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.020
out of that red ocean, because

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.780
you have customers who value

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.060
this case, well, then,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.720
the convenience, proximity

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.640
and time span.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.080
It is a way to be present in this

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.400
market, in a niche.
