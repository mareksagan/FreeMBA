00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.510
As I commented on the introduction

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.450
to the accounting course,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.070
what I would like is that you

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.350
are able to understand accounting

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.370
well, understand financial statements,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.670
know how to interpret

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.550
them and have some basic

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.050
notions about accounting

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.990
practice.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.930
Therefore, you don't need to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210
be an expert in seating accounting,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.790
or even be able to do so,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.610
although I think it's okay

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.290
to have certain notions

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.790
about how the process

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190
is, what tools are used,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.930
etc.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.210
And in today's class we will make

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.770
a brief review of the entire process

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.450
from the diary, accounts and financial

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.990
statements to a specific case.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.560
A brief preliminary review of the process.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.540
We recorded every movement in the journal.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.280
These movements are also

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.600
recorded in each account.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.880
We have balance sheet accounts

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.280
and results accounts.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.400
At the end of the year, we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.160
transfer the balance

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.800
of each account to the financial

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
statements.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.360
Let us start by seeing how

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.880
we use the journal.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.920
What we're going to see, this is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.720
the diary, is how we're noting

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.580
different movements.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.980
For example, we create society.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.720
The bank account grows 100,000 euros

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720
in debt and the social capital

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.760
account grows by 100,000 euros

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.960
opened.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.600
We buy the machine and pay

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.720
for it.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.260
We see how the balance of the machine

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.080
account grows.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.180
It is an active account, therefore,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.020
grows in debt.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.740
And from banks, of these $100,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.440
000 from banks, 75,000 come out.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.180
At this time the bank balance

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.760
would be $25,000.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.720
Now what we are going to do is a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.260
purchase of goods on credit.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.880
We will not pay the provider

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.100
in cash, but we will pay it in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.580
a short period of time.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.880
We note the purchase of commodities,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.000
which is a profit account,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.080
for $25,000.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.800
At that time, the account of the supplier

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.320
is growing.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.640
We are indebted to the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.280
supplier $25,000.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.580
We pay the provider.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.560
The banks are leaving $25,000 and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.360
we cancel the supplier

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.640
account, that debt we have,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.880
for $25,000.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.360
At this time the supplier account

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.640
has an account note on the debt

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280
by 25,000, on the have by

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.020
25,000.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.560
It is cancelled, there

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.820
is no balance.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.540
We are selling the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.340
goods we have bought.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.600
We are growing the customer

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.480
account because we haven't

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.020
charged it with $30,000 yet.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.140
And we record as an income the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.180
sale of goods.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.220
Look here that it is an account,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.400
it is not an asset or liability

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.280
account, but it is a account of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.480
the income status, by 30,000.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.160
And now we charge those customers

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.100
who owe us $30,000, we will

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.800
charge them.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.820
So the bank account increases

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.880
by $30,000 and we cancel

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.140
the debt that customers

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.980
had with us, as before

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.880
with suppliers.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.320
Now, just fix that we have two

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.740
notes on the customer account,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.340
30,000 and 30,000.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.700
The balance is 0.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.820
The last move is that we will

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.620
get a loan from a bank for

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.100
an amount of 80,000.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.860
Now what we're going to do is

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.960
to transfer all these movements

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.120
to each of the accounts.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.800
Accounts of assets.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.200
What we should do is go back to the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.980
newspaper, for example, to the banking.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.980
We would go back to the diary

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.120
and write down all the movements

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.140
we see that appear in banks.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.740
In this case not, in this case yes.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.720
We pass them all, on duty and on

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.180
having, and we get a balance.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.640
We do the same with the machine and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.300
with the customers.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.920
As you can see, the balance is 0.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.730
We do the same with the accounts of liabilities,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.290
which we only had the accounts

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.790
of suppliers and the accounts of

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.190
debt.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.850
The supplier's is cancelled

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.430
because the balance is zero

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.230
and the debt is $80,000 we owe.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.890
We also have results accounts.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.690
If you remember, we

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.990
only sold for $30,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.590
000 and bought goods

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.250
for $25,000.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.890
As you can imagine, the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.050
result of the exercise is $5,000.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.460
Finally, we have the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.280
net asset accounts.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.740
We made a contribution to the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.460
initial social capital of $100,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.320
000 and we also obtained

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.360
a profit of $5,000 that we

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.800
have not distributed, so they

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.580
increase the net asset.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.200
These 5,000 come out, as we have

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.680
seen earlier, from the accounts

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.280
of 70,000 and some expenses for

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.820
25,000.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.020
We already have all the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.840
accounts.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.240
What we will do is carry the balance

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.580
of the accounts to the financial

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.640
statements.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.980
In this case, we will look at

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.060
the balance sheet.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.300
Here I have passed the salaries

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.420
of each of the accounts of asset,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.960
net and liability and we can check

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.960
how we comply with the balance

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.560
or fundamental equation.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.340
The asset is equal to the liability

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.980
plus the net asset.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.220
And finally we'll see the results,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.680
which in this case is very

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.880
simple because we only

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.200
had sales for $30,000

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.360
and purchases cost sales

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.580
for $25,000.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.480
The difference is the result of the

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.160
exercise, which in this case we

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.060
have not distributed as dividends and

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.780
that is all in the balance sheet within

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.940
the net asset.
