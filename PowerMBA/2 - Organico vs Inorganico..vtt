WEBVTT

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.240
Another key concept for understanding

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.180
a company's growth is to

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.440
understand the difference between

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.520
organic and inorganic growth.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.100
We have seen the Ansov

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.080
matrix.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.740
The Antsov matrix, I like to

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.580
explain it this way.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.640
Ansov's matrix explains to us,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.080
indicates us where we should grow.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.800
If we grow in the current market, if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.600
we go to new markets, if we go with

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.700
new products, it is where we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.180
are going.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.300
Now we'll see how to grow.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.660
Once we have decided where

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.260
to grow, let's see how we

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.920
can do it.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.160
There are two ways.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.820
Businesses can grow organically

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.840
or they can grow inorganically.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.820


00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.520
These are not substitute decisions.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.740
A company can have many growth

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.480
strategies in parallel and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.340
in each one choose the organic

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.440
or inorganic form.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840
Growing organically is growing

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
from your internal resources.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.520
And growing in an organic way is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.940
supporting you in a second company,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.740
buying, merging, making a joint

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.180
venture or making a strategic alliance.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.760
To understand it well, grow in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.620
anorganic way.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.120
Facebook has grown inorganically

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.640
with the Facebook brand around

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.560
the world in a very short time

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.880
thanks to a huge competitive

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.820
advantage, thanks to the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.620
network effect, etc.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
In a few years it has expanded around

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.120
the world in an organic way with

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.560
its brand, its resources, its

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.560
capabilities.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.420
However, Facebook not only

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.280
grows organically, it also has

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.660
within the group strategies for

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.200
inorganic growth, which in this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.680
case is the acquisition, for

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.960
example of Instagram or WhatsApp.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.540
This is growing in an organic way.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.360
He bought these two companies.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.780
Inditex, the world's leading textile

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.480
group, has grown in an organic

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.980
way at the time when, for example,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.180
in the 1990s, it bought two brands,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.900
Massimo Dutty and Stradivarius,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.140
bought two competing brands,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.480
bought Massimo Dutty to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.420
raise the quality and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.780
price of its products

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.480
a little.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.400
That's a clear example of inorganic

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.800
growth, but of course, Inditex

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.120
has also grown organically

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.920
because all the subsequent

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.180
growth it has made with

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.500
those brands is organic.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.260
It has expanded worldwide,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.800
developed new products, etc.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.100
This is organic growth.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.360
The difference between organic

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.000
and inorganic growth is very

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
simple.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.180
You probably already understand, but

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.600
here the key is to understand what

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.100
are the advantages and disadvantages.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.840
Why do companies decide

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.960
to build, build or buy?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.240
Well, let's start with the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.700
benefits of organic growth.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.160
The first is that you grow

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.000
from your competitive advantages.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.880
Focus on what you are good about.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.660
When an organization grows organically,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.740
it is thanks to its competitive

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.880
advantages, its knowledge, its

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.980
resources, whatever it is,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.120
it is growing little by little.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.420
The initial investment is also smaller.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.460
You think that if you have

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.860
to buy another company, you have

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.220
to come to an agreement and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.880
pay and pay initially or in

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.860
places or as pacts, but you have

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.360
to face a large investment.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.360
If you grow organically,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.400
you adapt to the resources

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.440
you have at every

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.240
moment.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.800
It is easier to grow organically.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.900
The inorganic, mergers, acquisitions

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.120
have many complexities

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.820
that we will see.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.400
We have to bring together two companies

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.700
with different cultures, etc.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.240
There are many tensions and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.120
organic growth is more flexible.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.900
You can grow at the pace you want.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
If we want to, imagine Inditex, the case

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.720
before, because if you want to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.520
open two stores in a country, three,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.880
four, which are, but of course, if

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.540
you buy a company, because in that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.640
brand equal they have a hundred

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.100
points of sale, a hundred

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.860
stores, because that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.940
growth is not flexible.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.640
Let's go to the advantages

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.800
of inorganic growth, which are

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.200
mainly two advantages.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.460
One is speed.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.160
If you want to grow very fast,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.580
inorganic growth is easier.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.320
If you are a competitor who has

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.760
the same market share as you,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.460
you can double your market share

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.160
if you buy it the next day.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.060
It is much more immediate.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.700
Or do you want to go to another country?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.820
For between growing organically,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.860
you have to get there,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.720
create offices, learn,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.120
file people, etc.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.160
When you buy a company that is

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.340
there, you can imagine

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.920
the difference in speed, in the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.180
immediate.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.940
And the second advantage, it's something

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.700
very important that we have to

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.660
understand, it's a concept that

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.180
you have to incorporate, it's synergies.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.960
The synergies between the company

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.380
that buys and the company that buys.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.260
The synergies are basically explained in this way.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.540
There are synergies when one plus one

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.160
is not two, they are three, because

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.720
they are benefited.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.340
Either the one who buys, or the one

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.520
who sells, or the whole.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.200
And synergies are produced by

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.660
a number of different factors.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.120
Let us look at some as an example.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.590
Sometimes it is the distribution channel.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.810
Kellogg's bought Pringles

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.670
to win the world's

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.270
business.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.870
Well, think Kellogg's for example

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.010
has agreements for many years

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.550
with distribution channels

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.110
like Walmart for example.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.270
And Pringles probably has other

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.190
deals with other major distributors.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.870
Well, because by joining the two

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.150
companies, with the formula it is,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.870
both come out benefited from that.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.310
Kellogg's can start selling on the distribution

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.130
channels that Pringles and Pringles have developed,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.390
and Kellogg's can also start

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.390
selling on the distribution channels

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.330
and vice versa.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:15.870
The channel of technology.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.630
Amazon has acquired Whole Foods.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.030
It is a recent operation that is very

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.650
well known and that synergies have

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.410
been much analyzed.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.370
And I'll explain to you, for example,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.270
so that you can visualize the benefits

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.210
of both.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.150
Amazon already had sales.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.290
There are some shops called Amazon

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.990
Go.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.870
Amazon is a technologically

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.890
advanced company that invests

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.090
a lot in I plus D.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.810
And what has been implanted in

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.290
those points of sale is a checkout

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.790
system in which you when you leave

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.210
the store do not have to stop paying,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.210
but you get it directly from

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.530
your card associated with your

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.790
Amazon user.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.450
This is a technology that Amazon has.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.850
Whole Foods doesn't have that

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.170
technology, it has many others, but

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.030
that doesn't.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.310
When Amazon buys Whole Foods,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.370
Whole Foods will probably

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.230
benefit from that technology

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.290
developed by Amazon and will

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.810
soon be deployed in Whole

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.970
Foods stores.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.690
It is an example of synergy or vice versa.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.330
In this case, I say the opposite

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.410
because it is a synergy that Amazon

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.490
will benefit from.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.670
Amazon has a service that is Amazon

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.110
Fresh that by buying Whole Foods will

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.250
improve because it will be able

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.450
to incorporate the offer of Whole

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.050
Foods products of higher quality and

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.730
also the logistics improves

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.190
because it has more points of distribution,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.510
etc.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.390
These are two examples of synergies.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.050
One plus one is equal to three because

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.930
both companies are beneficial.
