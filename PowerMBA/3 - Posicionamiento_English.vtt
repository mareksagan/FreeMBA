00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.740
Miguel, at The Power MJ we have

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.100
drawn the process segmentation, targeting,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.360
we have made an analysis of our

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.440
customers as they are, with the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.480
customer person, etc.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.320
Then comes the positioning

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.660
phase, which is really brand

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.540
positioning.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.580
What is brand positioning?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.360
For the brand positioning is

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.380
to find a hole, a hole where

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.500
battles are fought against

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.780
competitors.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.160
Where are the battles going?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.680
in the mind of the consumer.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.700
So, in the end what you have to find

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.420
is that opportunity, that resquire

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
that leaves you that mind of that

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.520
customer who is receiving 5000,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
6000 inputs daily and who is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.800
left with a 0.3% of, I don’t know

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.440
what percentage will be left.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.100
You have a minimal opportunity and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.240
therefore you have to move a very

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.560
clear idea.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.020
You have to move your difference,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.500
your essence and your added value.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.380
And in short, the keys are to be different,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.000
but of course, being different

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
is not enough, it has to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.900
be relevant.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.280
That is, no, it’s that I’m

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.560
yellow, indeed, he’s different,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.280
but is it relevant that you’

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.900
re yellow?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600
No, then it is not worth it.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.620
Positioning is the significant difference

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.720
compared to the rest.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.820
That significant difference is what gives

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.460
you the opportunity, which allows

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.840
you to be competitive.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.660
That is positioning.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.500
Now, lately, positioning

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.380
in search engines, that is another

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.300
positioning.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.560
It’s another thing, yes, I really like

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.500
to clarify it because if you can’t

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.540
take care of it.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.740
Positioning is a much

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.800
more strategic concept

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.100
that everyone, any business

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.860
and business management

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.900
expert, has to

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.920
understand.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.960
Brand positioning versus

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.600
search engine positioning

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.960
is different.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.380
Brand positioning is the guide,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.340
it is the relevant difference that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.600
allows me to find that gap of competitive

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.160
differentiation.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.560
Miguel, give us some example of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.060
the positioning to understand

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120
it well, of some known company.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.780
A classic positioning is that of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.820
Volvo, which has bet on an attribute.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.300
He chose within the category, could

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.900
choose various attributes and chose

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.180
one, which was the security attribute.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.800
If you say Volvo, people

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.160
quickly identify the concept

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.640
of safety.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.920
What is what happens?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.020
As the market, the industry,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.840
and the industry evolved,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.420
all brands are considered

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.520
safe.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.220
It’s a bit like the concept of quality.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580
Volvo has abandoned the concept

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.480
of safety.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.060
Or rather, it has abandoned something

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.300
that is a maximum for all brands,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.440
which is to innovate.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.260
And they had to have continued to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.380
innovate in the safety axis that customers

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.260
attributed to them.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.460
Yes, because I actually think that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.200
in the 90s or 80s, Volvo had

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.780
this car, from the perspective

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.080
of today, amazing, square

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.120
and so on.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.000
But there were many families, of a certain

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.260
profile, who bought Volvo because

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.080
it was safe.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.640
The rest was not the same.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.720
It wasn’t as bad as the car,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.000
but it was safe.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.140
I think Volvo is not...

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.600
This you just said is important,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.780
because you can choose

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.480
an attribute and you

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.000
can clearly bet on it.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.120
You can also be competitive

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.640
if you make this bet.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.760
And you can transfer that relevant difference

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.340
to the market that ends up taking

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.200
and ending up understanding that added

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.780
value that you bring and that ends

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.500
up choosing you.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
But if you abandon the rest of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.860
the items, if your price is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.420
inadequate, if your design is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.700
horrible, if it is extremely

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.420
uncomfortable, if the car is noisy,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.940
the others will say, hear, that I

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.960
am also sure, but I have everything

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.540
else.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.760
You can’t abandon the rest

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.140
of the items that are

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.480
important and relevant to that

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.240
customer.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.080
That is a double conclusion.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.140
On the one hand, in that important difference,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.940
which is the procedure,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.080
you have to support yourself.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.360
And you have to keep supporting yourself,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.600
not like Volvo has forgotten it.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.740
But in addition, you can’t neglect

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.760
the rest, because of course, without

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.760
the basics, your difference

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.480
doesn’t matter.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.840
Everything else would be a disadvantage.
