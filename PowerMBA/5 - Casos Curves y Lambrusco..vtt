00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
Let's see one of the most common cases that always serve as an example of the strategy

00:13.320 --> 00:16.080
of the blue ocean, which are the curved genesis.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.000
What I intend is that you reinforce your knowledge of the tools of blue oceans.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.040
In addition, you will see that cases like this, when you explain it from the tools of the strategy

00:27.040 --> 00:31.320
of the blue ocean, the key to success is understood much better.

00:31.320 --> 00:37.680
The curved genesis are a very international chain of gyms with North American origin

00:37.680 --> 00:42.200
that have a particularity, which is that they are only for women and are also very focused

00:42.200 --> 00:46.960
on collective classes designed for this target audience, which are usually women of

00:46.960 --> 00:47.960
middle age.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.320
The process I propose is the following.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.440
First, we analyze the sector.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.440
We have to understand very well how the competition works in the sector in which we are.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.000
What do the companies that are in the sector of the gyms do?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.960
Subsequently, what we are going to do is define our target audience, but we are not going

01:03.960 --> 01:07.560
to be a few sheep like the rest of the companies and we are going to address the same customers.

01:07.560 --> 01:12.720
No, we are going to look for other market space in which there is no competition.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.240
And finally, what we have to do is develop a value proposal, a specific value curve

01:18.240 --> 01:21.120
for that target audience of ours.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.880
And let's start.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.320
We are analyzing the sector.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.320
We want to understand what are the competitive factors around which the sector of the gyms

01:28.320 --> 01:29.320
revolves.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.840
As we have said before, what do the gyms invest in to provide value to their customers?

01:32.840 --> 01:35.840
Or what are the factors around which the competition revolves?

01:35.840 --> 01:36.960
Well, the price is clear.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.960
We are going to incorporate them into the strategic picture as we go along.

01:41.960 --> 01:47.280
Another very important factor is the machinery, the facilities, the square meters.

01:47.280 --> 01:52.800
It is also something in which the gyms have to invest a lot because it is very expensive.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.560
Customized attention, the availability that you have in a gym of a monitor is something

01:59.560 --> 02:04.600
that has a huge implication in costs, but also in the value offered to customers.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.400
And finally, the services.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.840
Premium gyms have many amenities services, which are called clean towels

02:11.840 --> 02:14.920
every day, etc.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.920
And here we have the strategic picture in which we have incorporated, as we can see

02:18.920 --> 02:22.440
below, the competitive factors.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.280
We are going to draw the value curves in the sector of the gyms and what we are going to do

02:27.280 --> 02:30.280
is consider that there are two main segments.

02:30.280 --> 02:36.360
There are the premium gyms, like Equinox, an American chain, that if we see the curve

02:36.360 --> 02:40.440
would be above because they have very high prices, the facilities are spectacular, you have

02:40.440 --> 02:45.680
a lot of customized attention, availability of monitors and finally you have a lot of

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
services.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.080
And the most common gyms, a normal gym, is a little below, but it really offers

02:53.080 --> 02:55.000
the same in less quantity.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.840
Therefore, we could even merge the value curve because in the background everyone competes

02:59.840 --> 03:03.000
the same, to a greater or lesser extent, but everyone competes the same.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.600
Well, now what we have to do is identify who we are going to go to.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.280
What are we going to do?

03:10.280 --> 03:12.800
Look for them, go to the same customers as the rest of the gyms?

03:12.800 --> 03:18.920
No, because then we will not be able to create a blue ocean, we will be creating a red ocean,

03:18.920 --> 03:22.880
we will be competing with the rest.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.520
We want to go to another segment of customers.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.320
And in the case of curves, what he has done is, well, if you see this photo, I think it is

03:31.320 --> 03:34.800
very representative of who the curve customers are.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.520
I'm going to give you a piece of information.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.880
A large part of the curve customers would never go to a traditional gym.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.120
This says a lot about the subject and the key to success.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.320
Because Curves has been able to create a new market space, a new demand space.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.760
He has created it from scratch, he has not had to steal it from his competitors, okay?

03:52.760 --> 03:55.120
And in that market space he does not compete with anyone.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.640
Instead, the rest of the gyms all compete to steal customers.

03:59.640 --> 04:05.880
And finally, Curves what he has to do is develop a value proposal that we are going to draw

04:05.880 --> 04:09.600
through the value curve for that segment of customers.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.400
Remember this concept, okay?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.720
Innovation in value.

04:12.720 --> 04:17.960
If you want to create a blue ocean, you have to look for creating more value at a lower cost.

04:17.960 --> 04:18.960
And how do we do it?

04:18.960 --> 04:21.600
Well, we do it with the matriz, he says.

04:21.600 --> 04:26.040
On the one hand, what we have to look for is a cost reduction.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.840
How do we reduce the cost?

04:27.840 --> 04:33.560
Well, what we do is reduce and eliminate cost factors.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.680
Identify some factors that our customers do not value or value less and reduce them

04:38.680 --> 04:43.480
a lot or directly eliminate them, which allows us to reduce costs a lot.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
Look, examples.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.120
In the case of Curves, it is that it looks super clear.

04:48.120 --> 04:53.480
The machinery is much smaller than that of traditional gyms.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.200
Much less has been spent on machinery.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.160
There are no running tapes, etc.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.240
The facilities are simpler, they are much simpler.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.040
They are smaller rooms, etc.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.000
In addition, the services offered by the amenities are smaller.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.080
And another fact is that as a consequence of the fact that it is only for women, for example,

05:14.080 --> 05:17.240
it does not have to have two changing rooms, it only has to have a changing room for men.

05:17.240 --> 05:22.160
All this, the factors that we have reduced and that we have eliminated, allows Curves

05:22.160 --> 05:24.560
that its cost decreases a lot.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.440
Here we see it in the value curve so far.

05:26.440 --> 05:32.440
We have the traditional club and we have Curves, which is below in price, in

05:32.440 --> 05:35.200
facilities, in services, in personal care.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.680
In these factors it invests a lot, which allows it to have more margin.

05:39.680 --> 05:46.960
Well, now Curves has the challenge of creating more value for its target audience.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
And how does it do it?

05:47.960 --> 05:53.080
Well, what it does is incorporate some factors that until now, create factors, the C of

05:53.080 --> 05:58.680
RICE, which until now the rest of the gyms had never taken into account, which is to limit

05:58.680 --> 06:04.920
it only to women and create collective classes designed specifically for that target audience.

06:04.920 --> 06:09.200
And here we have it drawn in the value curve.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.040
We have added, we have created a new factor, which is this, which the rest of the clubs do not

06:15.040 --> 06:16.960
take into account, as you can see, it does not arrive.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.360
And Curves what it does is offer a high value in that.

06:19.360 --> 06:27.440
Well, as a consequence of the Curves strategy that its blue ocean has created, it does not compete

06:27.480 --> 06:28.480
with anyone else.

06:28.480 --> 06:34.400
It has created a value proposal so disruptive, so different and designed for a segment of

06:34.400 --> 06:40.520
customers that the others do not attend, that it fields its branches in its new market space,

06:40.520 --> 06:44.800
which has allowed it to grow in a few years worldwide, become one of the main

06:44.800 --> 06:48.000
global companies and a huge and millionaire company.
