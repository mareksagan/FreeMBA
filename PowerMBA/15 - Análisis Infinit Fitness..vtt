00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.830
Today I will share with you the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.670
analysis I proposed you the other

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.830
day of the Infinite Fitness case.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.050
I chose Infinite Fitness because

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.650
it's a chain of gyms I know

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.870
and because I think its business

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.770
model can help us reinforce a

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.510
series of concepts we're learning

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.070
and that I want us to work

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.870
on seeing more cases, which

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.170
is the best way to go assimilating

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.430
the concepts.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.550
You probably already understand,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.610
you already know the definition

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.830
of the concept of entry barriers,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090
scalability, exchange costs,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.430
the recurrence of the English,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.410
cash flows, but it is not

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.850
about knowing the definition.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.450


00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.150
Everyone knows the definition.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.010
What it is about is that you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.750
understand well what we are referring

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.670
to and be able to apply

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.110
it to different business models

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.370
or in analysis of different types.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.230
When you are able to do that, it

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.670
is when you have really acquired

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.610
valuable knowledge.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.430
Well, let's get the conclusions, with

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.150
the Infinite Fitness analysis.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.970
The first thing I want to say

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.950
is that two business models

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.270
really come together.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.910
Why is?

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.510
This is very common in chains

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.230
that grow through the franchise

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.530
model, because we are talking

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.510
about having a distribution

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.970
channel of their own, which are

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.770
owned gyms and a distribution

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830
channel in which you support

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.730
partners as they are franchised.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.450
It is a direct or indirect channel.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.530
And this has huge implications

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.150
for the rest of the business

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.530
model, so I think it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.350
two business models

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.010
that coexist.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.210
Well, by the way, it is common in

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.070
all franchise chains, it is a distribution

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.090
channel of its own, because

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.190
you can't franchise if you

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.350
don't know the operations

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.550
and you haven't had first

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.950
success in that business.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.230
I will analyze them separately.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.050
On the one hand, I will analyze

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.190
the business model of the own

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.670
gyms of Infinite Fitness, which

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.150
is really a regular business

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.950
model of any gym.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.270
The customers are the neighbors, they

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.290
are the people who live around, the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.950
gyms are their own, it's a distribution

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.850
channel of their own and here

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.530
we come to the first of the conclusions,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.850
with the flow of income.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.650
What about the flow of income?

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.870
What would your analysis of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.070
a gym's income flow be like?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170
I think there are two clear

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.430
strengths.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.110
The first is that the income is very recurring.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.870
Partners pay a quota very recurrently

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.050
and a gym is very easy to anticipate

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.010
what you're going to There's some

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.550
temporary seasonality, because

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.630
there are times when there's a

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.830
lot of highs and there's times

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.530
when there's a lot of lows,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.150
but well, it's something you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.070
can count on.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.270
So, income is recurring,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.510
that's a clear strength.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.890
There is another concept that you should

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.970
incorporate, which is that of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.630
exchange costs.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.670
I asked you to think about the exchange

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.150
costs.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.690
Exchange costs, as I have said

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.610
other times, occur when it is difficult

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.190
for the customer to change.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.770
In some sectors, exchange costs are

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.790
very high and in others they are

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.370
very low.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.170
And in the gyms, there is a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.590
certain exchange cost, especially

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.610
because chains like Infinite Fitness,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.050
in many cases, encourage you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.050
to commit to pay, for example,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.190
a year in exchange

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.550
for a price reduction.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.970
So, that makes the exchange cost

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.210
very high, because if you drop

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.930
and you have a few, that is,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.850
you have not a few months,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.370
because it is costing you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.490
a lot to change.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.310
It is another strength of the income flow.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.410
In the revenue stream it is clear

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.930
that gyms have, it is a very

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.890
attractive model.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.290
Now, let's go to the part

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.130
of resources and costs.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.990
It is clear that the most important

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.970
resource that a gym has is related

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.510
to the local and with the machinery,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.870
which costs a lot of money

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.730
to reform the local and maintain

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.950
a machinery that has been left

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.150
alone and that in addition

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.810
any of the machines because it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.950
costs a lot of money, generates

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.270
very high performance quotas.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.410


00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.450
Well, it is clear that the resources

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.070
are these and we will analyze

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.450
them in the business model from

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.550
this perspective.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.170
On the one hand, I have raised

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.330
you, these resources generate

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.670
entry bars, they generate

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.310
entry bars, because when you have

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.150
a gym in a particular site, that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.010
area is protected, there will

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.830
be no crazy who puts a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.970
gym next to yours in

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.770
principle, unless it is

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.990
a gym with a very different

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.030
concept, much cheaper or much

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.810
more premium.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.370
It's an entry barrier, at the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.590
moment you have a location

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.150
and it's yours, you're generating

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.190
an entry barrier for potential

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.470
competitors.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.830
This is good.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.470
But on the other hand, there

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.710
is a clear weakness that we have seen

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.530
other times and is that the scalability

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.450
is very low, when you depend

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.850
on resources as they are, such

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.770
as having the asset in ownership

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.790
or the local.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.990
You grow very slowly and that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.050
is why it is exactly because

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.570
of this weakness, many chains

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.710
opt, not only in the gym

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.750
sector, but the hospitality

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.190
sector, etc., opt to grow

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.030
through franchises.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.210
This is the answer.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.510
They are companies that have ambition

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.170
to be big, but they can't do

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.890
so by mounting them all the gyms,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.090
because of course, the need

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.450
you have for capital is huge and

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.010
if you want to grow very fast,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.630
what you can do is opt for

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.110
the franchise model and we'll

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.210
analyze it on the canvas.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.330
In this case, we have a similar photo.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.890
The gym clients are still the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.170
neighbors and you are charging a

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.030
much smaller amount because you

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.410
are charging a franchise, a

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.050
percentage of, well, there are

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.650
different formulas, but this

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.210
is not the important thing now.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.530
The important thing is that your key

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.990
resource to grow are no longer the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.390
gyms, nor the machinery, nor the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.710
locals, are having agreements

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.830
with franchisees.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.850
Which resource do you think is more scalable?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.130
The franchise model is

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.190
much more scalable.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.510
It's much easier to grow without

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.990
the need to permanently make additional

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.930
investments through franchise.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.670


00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.670
And in fact the model, that's

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.870
why the franchise model

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.030
is so attractive, because if you'

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.330
re fine, if your franchisees

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.110
are fine, your income

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.730
can be shot, remember the scalability

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.150
curve, your income can be shot

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.190
and your costs can remain

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.330
relatively flat because

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.610
your costs are your central

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.170
service structure that

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.770
serves your franchisees.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.740
Let us make a final review.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.840
We start with the channel model.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.860
It is an attractive business with

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.640
recurring revenue in terms of revenue

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.940
flows because they are recurring

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.060
and because there are certain

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.220
costs of changing customers.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.960
This is an attractive model.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.860
However, it is a very difficult

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.980
model to grow.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.540
Why is?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.060
Because you need key resources

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.180
that are very capital-intensive

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.080
and if you want to grow a lot, if

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.800
you want to open 10 gyms, because

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.080
you have to Well, then what happens

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.800
is that if you grow, you

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.100
can do so, but in addition

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.680
your costs will grow proportionately

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.180
because you will have to

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.460
hire more staff, you will

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.640
have to pay more rent, etc.,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.960
more machinery, more

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.920
renting, etc. etc.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.420
Is it worth?

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.700
This would be the curve.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.940
However, what we do, of course,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.120
is opt to combine it with a

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.760
formula that allows us to

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.240
grow more scalably, which

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.220
are franchises.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.820
Why is?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.160
Because we no longer need

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.320
to grow assets as capital-

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.540
intensive as machinery,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.500
but what we do is that

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.000
those assets are put

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.600
by franchisees.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.180
We have turned a key resource

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.920
into a strategic alliance and

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.320
the resource we need are agreements.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.640
The cost structure allows

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.980
us to grow a lot, but the

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.140
cost structure can remain light

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.180
because the only thing we have

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.200
to have is central services,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.120
people in the central offices

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.260
that cover those franchisees.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.800
And so the curve could be like

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.460
that.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.520
We could grow with many

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.040
franchisees that push in revenue

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.400
and our costs that stay

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.980
more or less flat.
