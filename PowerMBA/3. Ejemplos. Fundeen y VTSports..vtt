WEBVTT

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.160
We'll use the Story Brand framework

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.260
to create a story as

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.860
attractive as possible for

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.840
the VT Sports case.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.920
What I want you to see is how it is

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.520
very easy, we have done it on the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.020
go, how it is very easy to create

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.120
an attractive story and that

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.020
it conveys the message to our

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.040
target audience that we are here

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.620
to help them and that we can

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.200
make their lives better, that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.340
after all is the main goal

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.900
in the communication of every

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.420
brand.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.500
What is VT Sports?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.240
It is a company founded by Hugo

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.780
Taracido who is a Power MBA student

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340
and who has been here with

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.480
us and has been transferring to

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.580
us his project and is dedicated

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.800
to managing and obtaining

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.100
university sports scholarships

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.600
in U.S. universities for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.020
young Spanish.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.580
very simple.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.840
Let us start.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.260
Let us start.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.180
As in every story, it has to see

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.320
a protagonist and this protagonist

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.640
always has to be that university,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.520
the target audience.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.160
What he can't at any time is perceive

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.400
that VT Sports is talking

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440
about himself.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.680
The protagonist is always the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.920
customer, we have repeated it thousands

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.880
of times and the first analysis

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.060
we have to do is to identify

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.400
what is the true desire of that

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.980
customer with us, with our brand.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.860
And here's what we have to do, the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.140
goal in this story is to make the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.980
protagonist dream, to make

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.780
him dream of that American

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.820
dream that is now within his reach.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.440
And how can we do it?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.260
We can do this by copys,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.620
title, etc., and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
by images.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.240
We have to tell you what will

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.280
be able to live there.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.360
Universitaries, precious

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.280
American universities, campuses,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.500
crowded sports stadiums,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.640
cheerleaders, etc.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.540
We have to make him dream.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.520
What will allow us to do that?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.800
That this story, if we excite

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.320
you, if we stick you from the beginning,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.540
you will already be interested,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.300
you will be willing to follow.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.500
How many websites do we visit every

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.800
day?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.620
I don't know, in dozens of websites

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.340
that bored us, that really don't get stuck.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.820
We have to get that, we have

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
to get that.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.300
VT Sports has to get that from the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.260
first moment its target audience

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.160
feels absolutely identified, feels

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.300
the protagonist of this story

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.220
and is already dreaming of going

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.920
there, with taking the plane

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.520
and going to study in the United

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.220
States.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.620
The subject is that like in every

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.880
story the protagonist has a problem

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.040
and here he has several problems

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.420
and they are very fat.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.360
The first is that that dream we have

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.600
drawn is very expensive, it costs

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.260
a lot of money, you probably

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.020
can't afford it.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.940
And the second problem is that if you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.900
want to manage it, if you want to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.700
manage a scholarship, because it is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.180
really very complicated because you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.760
have a...

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640
The story of the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.300
actor, a young man, who

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.800
doesn't know where to start.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.520
There are hundreds of universities in the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.800
United States, you don't know what the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.100
procedures are, you don't have any idea.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.000
This dream is unattainable to you.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.080
But what VT Sports has to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.420
is, at that moment, become

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.840
the guide, telling you calmly

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.820
that I'm here to help you.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.920
What are the steps to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.660
become a guide?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.040
The levers are empathy and the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.220
levers are authority.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.800
How can we generate empathy?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.480
very easy.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.100
Hugo has been there, he has been

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.560
a sportsman there, he has

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.200
lived that experience.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.700
Can you pass on to the Y two, how does it

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.500
generate authority?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.680
Very simple too.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.380
Every year VT Sports sends hundreds

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.240
of university students to the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.020
United States.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.460
You just have to give the data, you just

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.960
have to share the testimonials

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.220
of those university students who

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.440
are happy there.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.980
very simple.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.460
The protagonist has dreamed

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.680
of it.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.120
In addition, he is aware that he has

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.360
a problem and is aware that without

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.060
VT Sports that dream cannot

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.940
be materialized.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.460
But suddenly there are so many

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.060
doubts that you can stay there.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.760
This is the abyss we are always talking about.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.240
What are you doubting?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.140
So, about the march.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.800
I don't know if the process is

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.880
complicated or not.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.180
I don't know what time I have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.220
to make the requests for.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.480
If it's for this year, if it's for

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.140
the next course.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.440
I don't know if the process is

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.440
complicated or not.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.960
I don't know what it is I don't know if it will

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.820
cost me a lot of money.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.160
I don't know if I have an academic level.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.540
I don't know if I have enough English.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.420
I don't know if I have enough sports.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.940
There are so many doubts that this

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.240
may never happen.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.260
So at that moment, at that moment,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.940
we have to generate absolute

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.680
confidence in the protagonist

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.840
and tell him quietly that these

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.100
are the steps we will take.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.600


00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.660
It is true that at that time you will

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.840
not be able to detail absolutely everything

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.920
because I understand that the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.160
procedures here are complicated but

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.620
you have to generate comfort.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.040
And we get to the next, to the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.480
next stage of the story and it

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.500
is that we have to ask him to

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.240
make a decision.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.540
In this case, the decision we

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.380
have to ask you to request information.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.280
That does not stay there.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.760
It gives us the opportunity to tell.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.900
In every story, we always have

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.160
to show the protagonist what

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.740
is being played.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.640
What is at risk of all this?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.000
How will your life change depending

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.500
on whether you make the decision or not?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.380
And we will do it in two ways,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.380
as Story Brand shows us.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.820
We're going to make a happy

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.020
ending, and we've had to do

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.060
it from the beginning.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.540
He has to be very clear about what

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.760
the happy end is and we will

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040
also detail it as much as possible

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.480
because there are things he has

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.080
not been aware of.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.420
You will improve your CV and you will

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.840
be able to opt for better jobs

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.660
throughout your professional career.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.160
You will be able to work in other countries.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.440
You will be able to improve your

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.720
English, networking, live a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.960
unique experience, etc.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.160
We will point it out as

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.680
much as possible and what

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.860
we can do is to use testimonies

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.260
from students who have

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.300
been delighted and who

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.640
tell their experience

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.760
and we could even contact

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.880
them.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.740
The protagonist has to be absolutely

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.380
clear about how he will change

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.500
his life if he actually

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.240
ends up going to study

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.180
in the United States.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.220
And also another recommendation

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.300
that gives us Story Brand that

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.460
we can use is to help you visualize

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.020
the protagonist what the risk

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.960
we will help you avoid if you

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.240
let help.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.720
In this case, I was argued.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.120
What we're going to help him avoid

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.620
is, we're going to help him not

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.060
to miss out on that talent he

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.360
has, sports talent and that he doesn'

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.360
t miss out on those hundreds of

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.240
hours, those thousands of hours he'

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.140
s been training for his whole life

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.440
and that may never serve him for

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.780
anything because he's not going to

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.560
be a professional.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.200
It is a powerful message.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.820
We have to transmit to him that if he doesn'

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.820
t decide, all that opportunity that

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.560
he only has because the rest of the

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.320
world doesn't have that

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.480
opportunity, because maybe he doesn'

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.840
t have that talent, doesn't have

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.580
that level of sport, he will waste it.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.260
As we have seen, what we

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.160
have left is a story.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.000
It is a story in which the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.660
protagonist has to feel stuck,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.800
has to generate interest,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.320
has to emotional and also we

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.760
have to accompany him in decision

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.800
making.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.840
If Beatisports incorporates all this,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.680
incorporates this story that hasn't yet

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.580
done it through all of its communications,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.260
I'm convinced that your sales will increase

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.220
and that you'll be able

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.460
to get more.
