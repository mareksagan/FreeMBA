00:00.000 --> 00:22.520
Once you have been able to identify the main hypotheses that are implicit in your idea,

00:22.520 --> 00:27.840
that are implicit in the business model, sometimes in English they are used in terms that are

00:27.840 --> 00:34.320
buried and the term buried is used because sometimes those hypotheses are not so obvious

00:34.320 --> 00:39.520
and we have to unburied them, we have to identify all of them to validate them one by one.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.840
Well, the next step is, as I just said, to validate them.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.920
The next step is to see if those hypotheses, if you are in the right or you are not in the right.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.440
And I guarantee you that in 80% you will not be in the right.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.680
But hey, if we are able to learn it quickly without having spent a lot of money,

00:54.680 --> 00:57.680
you have room for maneuver to evolve.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.680
And how do we do it?

00:59.680 --> 01:03.280
Well, we do it through experiments, we do it through the minimum viable product.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.280
I want you to know that sometimes these terms are used indistinctly

01:08.280 --> 01:13.280
and all experiments in many cases are called minimum viable product.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.480
I think it is more intuitive to think about experiments from the point of view of specific tests

01:18.480 --> 01:22.480
to validate a series of specific hypotheses

01:22.480 --> 01:25.480
and the minimum viable product is perhaps a later phase

01:25.480 --> 01:28.480
in which we go out to the market with a minimum viable product

01:28.480 --> 01:32.480
that we will study in more detail and allows us to validate

01:32.480 --> 01:35.480
the totality of the business model hypotheses.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.480
It is not really easy to get all this going.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.480
What happens is that there are a series of companies that have done it successfully

01:42.480 --> 01:45.480
and I am going to tell you some cases and it will illustrate you.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.480
And when you see yourself in a similar situation, that you have to validate a specific hypothesis,

01:49.480 --> 01:52.480
it is a matter of looking for successful cases and doing something similar.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.480
We are going to see several tools to do experiments.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.480
The first and very common is to simply create a landing page.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.480
Instead of creating the product, we create a landing page that will help us learn many things.

02:05.480 --> 02:11.480
And I'm going to put you in the case of Buffer, which is an application that helps community managers,

02:11.480 --> 02:18.480
what helps you is to manage Twitter, to manage the editorial calendar of the publications you do on Twitter, etc.

02:18.480 --> 02:26.480
When his founder had this idea, he had no idea if his target audience,

02:26.480 --> 02:31.480
which are mainly community managers, felt the need for something like this

02:31.480 --> 02:37.480
or if the idea of ​​the specific product that occurred to him was going to be that he thought it was a great idea,

02:37.480 --> 02:39.480
but he did not know if his target audience would like it, etc.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.480
What did he do? Instead of creating the product, instead of spending a lot of money,

02:42.480 --> 02:49.480
he created a landing page, which explained in a very simple way how his product worked.

02:49.480 --> 02:56.480
And when people clicked the call to action button, it took them to another page where it said,

02:56.480 --> 02:59.480
I'm sorry, we have not yet created the product, etc.

02:59.480 --> 03:07.480
But of course, this, which he did in a very short time, because making a landing page can be done for free in a day,

03:07.480 --> 03:11.480
what it did was to learn many things.

03:11.480 --> 03:17.480
Well, quickly, from the first day, he was able to validate that there were people who felt that problem,

03:17.480 --> 03:24.480
that his proposal liked, he was able to identify who are the segments of clients that were clicking the most,

03:24.480 --> 03:29.480
and he was even able to validate certain metrics of his business from the first day,

03:29.480 --> 03:36.480
because he already checked first hand and numerically what percentage of the visits that arrived on the landing page,

03:36.480 --> 03:39.480
for example, they clicked the call to action because they had interest.

03:39.480 --> 03:46.480
However, he needed to validate one of the key hypotheses, which is if they were willing to pay.

03:46.480 --> 03:53.480
Well, he followed the same philosophy, Lean Startup, and what he did is, in addition to the landing page,

03:53.480 --> 03:55.480
he incorporated the price plan.

03:55.480 --> 04:02.480
Then he began to measure from the beginning how many people were willing to pay,

04:02.480 --> 04:05.480
and also what price plans they preferred, etc.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.480
Therefore, he was also able to validate this key hypothesis.

04:09.480 --> 04:17.480
Another tool to validate, in this case, that there is a problem, the solution, etc.,

04:17.480 --> 04:21.480
is to create a video in which you show your product, and this was done by Dropbox, it is a well-known case.

04:21.480 --> 04:28.480
Dropbox initially faced this situation, the problem was already validated,

04:28.480 --> 04:34.480
because there were many companies that were trying to create solutions similar to Dropbox,

04:34.480 --> 04:39.480
to cloud housing services, for individuals, to share files with others, etc.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.480
However, everything that was there did not work well, and in the end none had been successful.

04:44.480 --> 04:49.480
Dropbox was trying to raise money, but investors were very skeptical.

04:49.480 --> 04:56.480
And Dropbox did not have money to create the whole product, because it is a complex product that requires a lot of development.

04:56.480 --> 05:02.480
What he did was a mock-up, and recorded a video of about 3 minutes,

05:02.480 --> 05:08.480
in which the founder of Dropbox explained, he was explaining, you saw how it moved on the screen,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.480
and how Dropbox worked, but the product was not created.

05:11.480 --> 05:19.480
What he got was, overnight, the number of subscribers, of those interested in the product, etc., multiplied.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.480
And the founder always says that he learned many things.

05:22.480 --> 05:27.480
First, he eliminated the main risk, which is to have spent a lot of money to create the product when no one wanted it.

05:27.480 --> 05:36.480
And also, what he got was to go to the market much earlier, and he always says that delaying the exit to the market is a fatal mistake.

05:36.480 --> 05:43.480
He managed to have feedback from the first day, because many of these people, who also sign up,

05:43.480 --> 05:46.480
from the beginning the customers give you a lot of feedback, which helps you to evolve the product.

05:47.480 --> 05:53.480
As you can see, it was a real success, which allowed Dropbox to validate the main hypotheses.

05:53.480 --> 06:02.480
We can do experiments using the concept of fake, or smoke test, going to the market with products that are not really real,

06:02.480 --> 06:08.480
or you are pretending to be real, but deep down the product is not finished.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.480
These are Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, who are the founders of Airbnb.

06:12.480 --> 06:22.480
When they had the idea, it was validated that there was a problem, because the accommodation in hotels, etc., was very expensive.

06:22.480 --> 06:29.480
However, they had the idea of ​​saying, hey, why don't we make a platform where people share their house,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.480
and they can rent the room of another person, etc.

06:32.480 --> 06:38.480
But of course, at that time they didn't know if it was crazy or if anyone was going to want to use this type of service.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.480
And the first thing they did was, on a weekend, in San Francisco, there was a congress,

06:43.480 --> 06:49.480
and many people were going to attend, they created the website, very simple,

06:49.480 --> 06:54.480
and the offers they made were fake, and in some cases they were the ones who were going to use it.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
It was their house.

06:56.480 --> 07:03.480
But they wanted to know if there was anyone who was willing to pay to go to the house of another person,

07:03.480 --> 07:05.480
and share, and rent a room.

07:05.480 --> 07:11.480
And they did it like that, and they checked it very quickly, because that same weekend they had demand to rent their room,

07:11.480 --> 07:17.480
and they did it, they ended up renting the room, and then they learned first-hand how the interactions were,

07:17.480 --> 07:19.480
what the client expected, etc.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.480
They got a lot of value doing this test.

07:23.480 --> 07:28.480
Another tool that many people have used is crowdfunding, using crowdfunding platforms,

07:28.480 --> 07:32.480
the best known is Kickstarter, which allows you to validate many things.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.480
There is a smartwatch manufacturer called Pebble,

07:36.480 --> 07:42.480
and before building, designing the product, spending money on engineers, etc.,

07:42.480 --> 07:47.480
what they wanted to know was if that idea of that product, with those specific features,

07:47.480 --> 07:51.480
would be appreciated, or people would perceive value.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.480
Therefore, they had a series of very important hypotheses to validate,

07:55.480 --> 08:00.480
related to the value, related to the product, related to each of the features of the product.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.480
And what did they do?

08:02.480 --> 08:07.480
Well, they used Kickstarter, and it is one of the most successful cases in Kickstarter,

08:07.480 --> 08:13.480
because it got 10 million dollars, and it also validated that there are thousands of people around the world

08:13.480 --> 08:18.480
who saw that the product seemed super attractive, and they got two things,

08:18.480 --> 08:23.480
validate it, and not only validate it, but also get all the funding to create the product.

08:24.480 --> 08:31.480
A very common tool that Lean Startup also offers us to validate hypotheses and to learn,

08:31.480 --> 08:33.480
it allows you to learn a lot, is A-B Testing.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.480
A-B Testing is widely used in digital marketing, but we are not referring now,

08:38.480 --> 08:41.480
we are referring to using A-B Testing in the creation of the business model,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.480
in the creation of the product, in a previous phase.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.480
A-B Testing is widely used, and you will learn it in digital marketing,

08:47.480 --> 08:52.480
well, to test where to put the call to action, the buy button,

08:52.480 --> 08:54.480
and put it here or here, or the colors, etc.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.480
They are minor tests, but here I am talking about something more important and above.

08:59.480 --> 09:05.480
And I'll give you the example of Bounce, which is a simple application that is designed to help you

09:05.480 --> 09:08.480
not to be late for appointments, to manage time, etc.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.480
I do not know exactly how it works, what I know is that when it went on the market,

09:12.480 --> 09:17.480
they had no idea if the application was going to like someone or not.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.480
And what they did was to test different messages,

09:22.480 --> 09:26.480
to see what was the most powerful message with which they could go to the market.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.480
Well, they did a test A-B, in a test A-B what you do is,

09:29.480 --> 09:34.480
you bring traffic or potential clients to a landing page, for example,

09:34.480 --> 09:38.480
and what you are doing is permanently measuring how those clients behave,

09:38.480 --> 09:43.480
if they like the message A more, which is a value proposition promise,

09:43.480 --> 09:45.480
or if they like B more.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.480
It is a very clear test B, so if there is a clear winner,

09:48.480 --> 09:52.480
what you have to do is build your product, your messages, etc.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.480
all the marketing from that.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.480
And they also did it with the income flows,

09:58.480 --> 10:00.480
they did not know what price policy to apply,

10:00.480 --> 10:03.480
they did not know what price was best applied.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.480
And they did the same, they did a B-Testing,

10:06.480 --> 10:12.480
they brought traffic to both options, to A and B,

10:12.480 --> 10:16.480
and similar, but what changed was the price,

10:16.480 --> 10:19.480
so what they measured was the price sensitivity,

10:19.480 --> 10:22.480
if they were compensated to put a higher price or a lower price,

10:22.480 --> 10:25.480
depending on what was the impact on the demand.

10:25.480 --> 10:29.480
As you can see, the A-B Testing allows you to learn very quickly,

10:29.480 --> 10:31.480
it allows you not to have to guess,

10:31.480 --> 10:34.480
what you do is directly check it numerically.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.480
Well, in addition to specific experiments,

10:38.480 --> 10:43.480
the main tool to validate the hypotheses is the minimum viable product.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.480
The minimum viable product consists of going to market

10:46.480 --> 10:49.480
with a product with the minimum functionalities

10:49.480 --> 10:52.480
in the shortest possible time that allows you to continue learning,

10:52.480 --> 10:55.480
and we will see later in more detail in another class.
