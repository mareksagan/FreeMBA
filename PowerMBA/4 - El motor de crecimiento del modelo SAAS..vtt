WEBVTT

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.540
Victor, Uncle, thank you so much for

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.640
being here.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.540
We will do one thing, we will analyze

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.400
Application and we will do it with

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.940
the aim of better understanding

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.880
the SaaS business model and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.920
we will also analyze the growth

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.260
engine.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.400
I will ask you and we will see.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.900
What is Application?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.580
Who are they?

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.940
That is, explain who your followers

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.080
are, what value do you offer them,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.420
how do you generate revenue?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.620
Application.com is a website you

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.100
enter without having any idea

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.220
of programming.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.400
You create an app, 500 programming,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.320
choose a template, a few

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.160
modules, put your colors, your

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.920
social networks and you mount

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
an app that sells, reserves,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.420
that has continuous multimedia,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.860
what you need.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.660
We have focused a lot on Pime customers,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.200
on a customer who wants to jump to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.700
the mobile, who doesn’t know how to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.040
do it, who doesn’t have a brutal investment

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.300
to get there and who for 10 euros

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.780
a month has his app, has

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.100
it in the Apple Store and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.800
begins to generate business.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.120
Do you have a quota?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.840
There are three price plans,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440
one of 10 euros, one of 30 and one

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.140
of 50.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.060
Depending on the functionalities

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.320
you have, PUS notifications,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.440
you are getting a plan or another

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.620
and also the customer service

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.080
we provide.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.660
That is, the client is a software

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.840
you already have developed,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.960
that we have a revenue stream that

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.900
is subscription.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.040
Our business model is SAS, software

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.180
as a service, which

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.840
means you pay month by month

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.620
or year by year.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.500
If you pay year by year you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.040
get a 15% discount on the total

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.540
price.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.060
You are advancing annually and then we

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.820
don’t have premium features, that is,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.820
you don’t have one shot payments, you

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.460
don’t have a single payment, it’s all

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.320
month by month or year by year.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.240
The priority of the model is that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.280
we have a technology that has a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.780
lot of business margin and that we

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.320
are going to recover it by

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.620
gradually charging the customer in monthly fees.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
For our type of customer it is very

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.580
convenient because it does not make

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.940
a huge initial investment, eliminates

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.640
risk and at the same time for

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.400
us it is fine.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.960
Basically it is ultra-scalable

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.200
because there is no additional variable

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.280
cost or very low, I imagine that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000
very low can have a million more

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.600
users, by exaggerating, would

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.460
be a bit like.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.780
This is a B2B SAS and if we go

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.400
to B2C the consumer is also growing

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.660
a lot, for example on Netflix.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.100


00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.360
Today we all have some subscription,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.920
whether it’s Spotify, Netflix,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.240
the own phone quote, you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.560
pay month to month every month

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760
and it’s a subscription mode.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.560
It is the same business model, the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.280
telephone operator.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:59.240
I love the model for two things,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.260
one because it is actually totally

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.940
scalable and mostly because it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.980
did not generate friction.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.820
I like models where there is no business

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.400
friction, you have to enter a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.140
customer, register, create your

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.440
app, pay, continue to pay and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.960
there is no need for incredible

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.560
friction, especially humans,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.660
you don’t need to have a weight

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.560
of 2000 workers to have

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.000
10,000 customers.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.520
I come from strategic consulting

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.940
and when I was in that world the software

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.420
as a service seemed to me the most

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.640
attractive in the world because each

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.560
project is a wear, people

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.160
etc. and you have developed a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.360
software that the customer enters

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.800
directly, it provides a lot of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.060
value but does not need almost

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.340
any interaction and I also imagine

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.300
that the better the software,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.680
that yours is spectacular,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.120
the better it is, because

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.780
it requires less support.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.340
SaaS has many priorities, it also

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.040
has many bad things, especially

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.780
the principle.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.420
You’re paying customers

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.260
a very little.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.620
That is, I love that.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.020
We know what the software as a

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.940
service model is, in your

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.000
case it is B2B.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.100
Let us look at the main weaknesses.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.180
It is that the first year and a half

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.340
your box, if you need a lot of financial

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.060
lungs, you need a paste to survive

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.920
a year and a half because you are

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.800
charging customers very little by

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.020
little and you are normally not

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.200
Facebook or Spotify and you do not

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.620
get 800,000 customers.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.980
That’s because the cost of

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.480
customer capture, I understand

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.980
that the cost of customer

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.340
capture you don’t recover

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.720
until a few months

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.220
pass.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.940
That is, you have to fil very fine

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.080
and optimize your CAC, your acquisition

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.640
thing, because otherwise, you

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.860
never get it back.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.880
A SaaS is defined in the end as if your

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.060
CAC is lower than your lifetime

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.380
value, the business works.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.820
When you’re going to see an investor, the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.640
first thing you ask yourself is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.880
how many months it takes to recover the

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.360
passport.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.720
We call it the CAC payback.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.340


00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.280
If your CAC payback is 12 months,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.580
you have to fund for 12 months

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.600
all that growth.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.440
Then you have to focus on your

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.520
client being 13 months, at least

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.380
to earn him 10 euros, which

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.880
probably is not profitable, earn

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.460
only 10 euros.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.700
At the end you realize that the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.640
great weakness is that, that at

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.720
first you have to throw

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.940
out a lot of money, a lot

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.460
of money to survive.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.740
That’s what it does is that for

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.860
young companies and such can not be

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.900
financed with their own resources

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.680
and you have to go to funds,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.300
etc.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.780
It’s not like an e-commerce,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.660
that from the first day you

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.800
are buying a wallet, glasses, a bag

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.360
and it seems like no, but your

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.300
cash flow can be managed better

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.980
from the beginning.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.540
You need a very strong investment

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.000
in the beginning to grow.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.900
The second big weakness of the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.180
model is that you have to control the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.760
lower very well.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.060
If you need a very good software,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.380
the client will register.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.400
Your return to this value is milk,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.260
you make a video that is wonderful,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.360
you have an investment in your website

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.080
to register that is pear, but

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.380
if the product is not good,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.880
here the product is important.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.940
You can buy a wallet and

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.260
buy it.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.120
When you come home and say that

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.220
shit of your wallet.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.560
It is that you have the challenge of

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.260
every month to fall in love with

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.280
the customer because if you don’t get

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.440
down and as above you will be left

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.360
before you have recovered what you

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.700
invested in capturing him.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.880
What happens is that in some

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.800
cases also generate exchange

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.620
costs, a very high lock-

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.700
in effect in the software

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.220
world.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
I have met software colleagues

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.340
who their product was a lot to

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.760
be very good, but the cost

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.620
of changing, the software

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.360
was so stuck in the company’

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.880
s trips.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.540
Actually, now probably in the key,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.780
if you’re not a brutal pain, if

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.080
your software doesn’t generate

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.480
a pain and a brutal need to

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.160
that customer to go half wrong,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.200
what is the first thing I take

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.520
away?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.440
I put the opposite case in

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.960
accounting software, ERPs and

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.880
so on.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.440
They cannot be changed because they

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.240
have trained all their employees on that software.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.860
All operations are attached

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.700
to the software.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.540
In your case maybe...

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.580
In our case it’s a weakness because

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.660
the API of a business isn’t something

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.960
that’s hard to change for a company.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.500
Yes, it is true that we had

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.780
one thing happening and we

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.940
had a very clear metrics that

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.620
it was the third or fourth month

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.920
our client started to profit the app.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.860
And as soon as he started earning

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.340
money, it was very difficult for the

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.680
customer to leave.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.660
It profited.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.500
He is paying between two a month and

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.340
started earning $150 a month, $200 a

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.780
month.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.920
You became a necessity for the

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.760
client because he was cutting

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.260
off an income that was more

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.680
or less good for him.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.140
You almost turned into a lever

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.060
for the customer to generate

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.780
revenue.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.420
It was the most important

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.260
value we had.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.260
Start a business and make money

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.060
from mobile.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.520
That was the big proposal.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.100
What is happening?

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.000
We focused a lot on restaurants,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.280
e-commerce, very practical

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.300
things so that I could

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.200
get a quick return.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.240
Because if you stick to a

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.380
school, the app of a school.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.960
As soon as he sees that he is sick,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.340
he goes out.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.060
If the app is only informative, if the app

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.980
is supporting or something like that,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.740
it effectively cuts you.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.500
At first, especially in the first

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.980
year and a half, we were very

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.660
insistent about keeping people

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.860
making their app make money.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.100
We did downloads, we dynamized

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.460
the app a lot so that

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.980
they could get out and

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.660
stay with us.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.640
Then it was no longer necessary.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.840
The business took another action

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.460
and worked alone.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.120
But how hard it is to have a good product

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.260
from the minute zero so that it works

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.580
and so that people don’t give up,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.920
is something that, look, it’

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.240
s not to launch a web and it’

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.380
s actually a challenge.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.940
Then, as a wonderful thing about SaaS,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.000
it is that every month you raise

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.240
the person of the business and you

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.560
know that you will get in x 1000

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.580
euros, more or less, but there will

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.220
be the subscription model, every

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.380
month is the customer.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.500
Of course, that recurrence generates

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.100
a lot of security and that I imagine

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.020
that the most professional investors,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.800
etc., are what they are looking for.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.020
They look because you can project very well.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.620
The SaaS, all investors told

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.900
us, is the gold egg chicken, as

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.580
they put the key on the capture

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.380
lever, you have a capture cost

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.460
much lower than profitability

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.140
and your business really

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.020
adds value, the claw.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.060
Here you know how Wix, that you get

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.460
your web, the Sage, which

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.200
is of accounting, there are many

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.040
of these that walk on the key,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.460
walk on the lever and grow like

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.040
foam.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.300
In addition, you get feedback,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.260
become the accounting leader

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.040
or the leader of any

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.200
sector and start growing.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.100
One thing I love about the SaaS

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.380
model is the metric.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.440
I love it because it is AVC, it has no complication

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.960
and it is very measurable, everything

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.400
is very measurable and I love that.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.300
If I carry a pure marketing,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.760
I love measurement, I need it

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.600
to live.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.000
I always say that life is a conversion

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.800
funnel and in a SaaS it’s

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.940
as perfect.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.720
What costs me a click, what costs me

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.160
a lead, what costs me that the

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.780
uncle ends up being a customer, the

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.080
funnel in three parts and there is

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.680
the magic after the ground, of the

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.680
ARP 1, the middle ticket, the Aptimallu.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.900
We always the investors the worst

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.360
thing they told us was, and what is

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.580
your MRR?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.440
Until you have 20,000 euros of MRR,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.660
the MRR is the Moulding Recurring

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.560
Revenue, which is what you make

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.620
monthly subscription income,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.520
until you have 20,000 you do not

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.920
come to see me, which you have

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.700
not yet given in the target

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.080
20,000 euros.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.080
Can you give us some

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.640
data on the main metric?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.880
For example, we like the average

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.340
ticket per customer month to month,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.320
that is, with the pricing we had to

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.700
give 10, 30, 50 euros, was close to

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.900
the 30 euros 28 with 50 approximately,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.520
the ARP, the ARP, the Aptimallu,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.860
that we had month to month per

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.360
customer, then the Aptimallu,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.440
well that was varying a lot the

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.480
first year and a half but we were

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.420
able to reach up to 20,000 euros

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.440
with costs of captations

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.720
that dropped from 200.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.880
What is happening?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.920
One of the keys is that your capture model

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.400
has no ceiling, that is, you target

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.520
the folder on Facebook and Facebook

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.280
continues to attract, continues to attract

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.220
and continues to attract customers

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.820
in AdWords, on LinkedIn, of course,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.280
where it goes, in what countries,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.100
in what territories, etc.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.740
We had a problem that there was

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.640
a time when Facebook worked

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.360
very well at first, LinkedIn the

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.560
same, Twitter the same, and then

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.280
a moment that, you hear, we

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.360
hit the ceiling and we got numbers.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.360
The calculation we have made of

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.240
the ARP, customer lifetime value,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.320
cost of acquisition of customers, etc.,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.560
is only of what it tells us, it

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.900
is of the profitability that we will

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.960
get from each of the customers and

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.920
how it will be the cash flow, but

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.260
of course, then there is another variable

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.820
and how big is this, because

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.880
one thing is that we can sell it

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.380
to 10 people and I have already invested

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.560
more and I am losing efficiency,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.880
I can no longer grow, but for

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.400
it to be the billionaire round

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.140
business, because you have

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.140
to be able to multiply that

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.340
equation so simple by millions.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.840
Effectively, especially with prices

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.780
so low, with average tickets

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.060
of 30 euros, if you say an average

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.980
ticket of 2000 euros a month,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.860
with each customer you get

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.340
along anyway.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.460
Our case was not so, then we were

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.300
going to volume and when you started

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.100
to have done, because you have to

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.780
pull out other channels of

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.860
capture, mailing, SMS, more offline

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.700
topics, in the end we ended

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.400
up finding the channels of

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.900
capture in operators, operators

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.420
that sold our product and that

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.000
worked well and we had good

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.780
margin and scalable, but

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.760
we found that problem, the roof

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.200
of capture and a lot, a lot,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.860
a lot of focus on the soil, the

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.240
benchmark is if you exceed the

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.580
2% floor in a SaaS model that

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.740
you have a monthly ticket of

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.320
less than 100 euros, something

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.580
fails, something is failing,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.180
then you have to have a

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.260
product, a customer attention

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.420
and you have to solve a brutal

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.620
need for only 2% of customers

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.120
to be given down.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.620
We have called that model, forgive

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.080
me that you cut, we called him Sticky,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.180
this guy and what we say is the cost

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.820
of customer decision is very important,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.640
the cost of customer acquisition

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.700
is very important, but in the end

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.200
it is a consequence of everything

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.780
from the ground and we put some

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.120
example, because we talked about

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.300
Netflix, I don't know what

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.800
the cost of Netflix customer acquisition,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.860
but what Netflix has to do is that

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.640
I don't give me down in life

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.020
and when I'm 75 years old still

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.120
paying the quota and the cost

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.700
and they will have spent on

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.080
capturing me, I don't know

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.560
how much money three years ago.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.620
I’m sure that if you stay two years

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.960
on Netflix you’re still and be profitable

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.420
for Netflix, I’m 100% convinced,

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.580
in fact now Amazon is not a B2B model,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.560
it’s a B2C model, it’s launching

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.920
subscriptions like the Prime

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.240
Now, it’s thinking of raising them

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.500
because it realizes that in

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.960
Spain for $19,90 a year the Prime

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.520
model is not profitable, then at

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.200
the end it’s going to this, to

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.440
try as soon as possible to profit

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.980
the customer, or you go up

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.920
the price or lower the floor or

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.160
you take away the cost of

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.520
capture ever smaller or improve

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.260
your tool.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.480
At the end it is curious because that

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.660
is very simple, they are four metrics

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.040
and can be explained so, I love, things

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.180
are explained in a towel and this

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.620
is appropriate to recover it and

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.600
it can be that it does not degrade

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.940
in life and that your product

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.700
is excellent and that the exchange

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.840
costs are very high, that in your

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.760
case the exchange cost you have

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.200
generated because they already

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.460
earn money with your application,

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.100
then how will they be low.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.480
You take the pen to get that, until

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.960
you become a product that really

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.560
curves all the needs, a product

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.140
in which you create an app, how

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.280
many variables there are, techniques,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.520
functionalities, until

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.160
you get in the key and it works,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.580
you have to equip with many

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.660
verticals, in our case, you will

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.380
be launching functionalities

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.000
for restaurants, then for e-

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.160
commerce, then for clinics,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.540
then until you say here is,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.740
here is where I can throw.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.400
Can you give them data on the number of customers

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.000
like this?

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.920
Yes, well, they are virtually

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.720
public but we were able to 40,000

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.120
SMEs in the world, the country

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.420
movement, obviously not all were

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.880
paying that it would be wonderful

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.300
that everyone was paying 10 euros

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.180
a month, but it is true that

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.620
we had virtually the conversion

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.360
of those 40,000 around

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.280
10%, we had a mogollon of

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.380
SMEs, 40,000 and 5,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.800
000 SMEs paying us

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.640
a month.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.540
The Conversion?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.580
Is it a premium model?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.300
Yes, well, you enter, you have, you

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.820
still have, I speak of the past but

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.740
you can continue using the application,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.900
you enter there, you have to start that

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.060
free test in which you create your

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.980
application, you can see it, if

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.480
you want to publish in the markets

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.640
you have to give, it is the first

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640
stopper, you have to go into a addiction,

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.300
you have to pay one and then to

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.320
send push notifications, so that

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.740
the application works really

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.740
you have to pay, you don’

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.120
t have your 15 days of test

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.840
where you test.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.360
We changed a thousand things, before

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.860
it was a month, then it was a week,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.420
at the end there are 15 days,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.460
at first it was a boarding one way,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.900
there was a personal assistant

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.520
who guided you, the chat was on

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.480
the side, we started having

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480
only a price plan of 20 euros a

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.280
month, you are trying, to me that’

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.100
s what I like, I launch a web that

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.780
has four options, to see what is

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.260
the best converts, it’

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.700
s magic, it’s a mixture of sociology

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.680
and marketing very chou.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.080
Yes, sociology, marketing, engineering,

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.380
big data, it is very fun because

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.560
at the end you handle data of people,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.100
things that go on, why people do

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.920
this, why people do the other, then

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.340
at the end there is a post of mine

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.400
in my medium, if you put on twitter

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.000
begged fruits, they will see it,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.560
in which we make public the excel

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.560
type that we use to measure the

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.660
day-to-day of the company,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.400
and it is very simple, it is to

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.200
fill 15 cells in which you are

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.820
putting four things and it is

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.500
already there, that is why

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.900
it is a fashion of the company.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.080
I will put it on the link so

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.100
that all students can access it.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.360
Because it is a super simple

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.380
model, in the end what I am measuring

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.280
is measured by any tool, insta

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.140
page, mailchimp, akumba mail, all

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.840
these are measuring the same

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.260
thing as me because there

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.620
is no other thing to measure,

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.160
it is something very tangible.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.700
It is true that I put myself in your

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.340
place and it is a very attractive

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.620
business model because you can effectively

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.300
measure it very simply and any improvement

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.920
you make you notice very

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.200
quickly if it has created value,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.540
if better, etc.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.080
I, for example, when you are in the model

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.100
sas, like all models, you end

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.520
up saying the model sas, they pay me

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.280
10 euros a month, and it is true

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.040
that at the end of a advice I always

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.580
give is in the pricing theme, which

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.580
is a key topic from the beginning,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.780
put them very high because there

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.960
is always time to lower them

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.240
and measure from the beginning.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.280
They are two things that always

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.220
ask me, High prices, measure from

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.220
the beginning, you can always lower the

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.960
price, you put it at 50 euros, you

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.300
will put it at 30, don't worry, if

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.100
you see that no one buys you, and

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.880
I focus on the product.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.260
A lot of good product team, design,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.900
good engineers, because if not,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.660
the product is core in your company,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.180
then the next phase is to capture,

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.400
but if you are not a core product,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.500
you do not capture with

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.260
anything.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.500
We stay with that.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.060
Thank you very much, I hope

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.960
to see you again.
