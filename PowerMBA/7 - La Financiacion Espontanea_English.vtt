00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.660
In this class we will take a step

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.680
further with the aim of understanding

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.060
well what each of the balance

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.620
sheets mean and how the active

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.920
and passive balance works.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.080
We will be introducing the concept

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.160
of spontaneous funding.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.420
I want you to understand it well.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.690
In the previous classes, we

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.590
have seen that companies have

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.250
to finance their assets.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.050
For this they will need

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.350
to get funding.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410
We’ve put it all together in one

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.070
block, right?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.070
Total financial needs.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.850
But if a company has an asset

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.030
of $100,000 it will have

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.170
to obtain foreign funds or own

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.530
funds, either net asset or debt,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.210
whatever, to be able to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090
finance its activity.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.250
Instead, let’s go a little further

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.510
and what I’ll explain

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.890
in this class is how spontaneous

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.530
financing works.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.430
How does the financing that suppliers

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.310
grant us due to the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.530
company’s own operations work?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.250
Remember that the supplier

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.010
balance reflects what we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410
owe the supplier at that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.670
time due to a delay in payment.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.730


00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.870
We compare goods, but instead of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.030
paying the bill to the supplier,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.730
we pay you within a period of time.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.690
During that time, the balance is in

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.450
the balance sheet.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120
Well, what I want you to understand

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.300
is that I have decided to devote

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.240
a class to this because I have seen

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.500
that many times it’s not well

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.880
understood.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.120
What I want you to understand is that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.500
spontaneous financing, in this

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.260
case those 20,000 euros in the balance

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.980
of suppliers, which allows us

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.420
is that we do not have to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.860
obtain funds of the partners’

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.320
own contribution or financial

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.680
debt for the total of the asset.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.720
In this case, we only

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.940
need to get funds

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.120
worth $80,000.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.480
That is, the entire asset minus

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040
the spontaneous financing.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.080
This is really an advantage.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200
You do not have to fund your entire business.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.860
Suppliers are helping you.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.200
You do not have to pay for it, go

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.860
to the market or go to the banks

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.500
for debt.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.760
That is, the larger the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040
supply party, the better

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.140
for the company.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.300
And let’s put it, so that you understand

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.780
it well, I have put an example

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.740
with two extreme scenarios.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.660
Business is a very simple business.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.540
We are going to be buying and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300
selling used smartphones.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.820
We will do it from our house.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.560
We do not need to invest in

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.900
any non-current asset, in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.960
any fixed asset.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.260
We will sell it via

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.840
eBay.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.440
All we have to do is buy a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.320
batch of smartphones and sell it.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.440
The first lot we will buy

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.300
is $100,000.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.940
It’s the same as the asset we’ve seen before.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.220
And we also know that in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.560
the whole lot, we give it out.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.960
That is, we sell it in a period of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.580
less than about 30 days.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.460
What I want is that we reason

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.100
to answer the following question.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.620
How much funds do we need to obtain?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.100
I will present two scenarios.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.700
In scenario A, we pay

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.660
the supplier $100,000

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.500
to purchase the goods.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.600
Before we get to the market,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.000
we have to pay the bill.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.280
What is the total amount

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.180
of financial needs?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500
How much funds do we need?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.400
We have an asset of $100,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.680
000 which is all current asset.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.680
And we need to finance, to get

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.660
a total of $100,000.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.860
Either from own funds or from

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.020
foreign debt funds.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.210
I’ll give you a B scenario.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.190
We pay the supplier for 60 days.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.650
We buy the goods, we start

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.290
operating with them and even

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.870
within 60 days we do not have

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.930
to pay the supplier.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.750
Remember that in 30 days

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.170
we were going out, we

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.370
sold all the goods.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.390
Let us go to balance.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.210
In this case, if we make

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.010
a situation balance, right

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.010
after the purchase of the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.090
goods, from smartphones we

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.390
have an asset of $100,

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.270
000 that are smartphones.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.950
We haven’t sold them yet and

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.530
we have a $100,000 liability.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.150
This is the debt we have to the supplier.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.370
So here I go back to the question.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.790
How much funding do we need

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.010
to get to fund the activity

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.270
in this scenario?

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.250
You have probably already come to the conclusion.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.910
We do not need to contribute anything.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.170
The provider, this is an extreme

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.150
case, but so does spontaneous

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.130
financing.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.670
The provider is helping us to

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.230
finance our activity.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.560
Providers are equal to spontaneous funding.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.540
Stay with this.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.340
The only thing I wanted was

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.440
that you understood in this class

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.200
how the provider, how the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.640
provider account, reduces

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.100
the totality of financial needs.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.180
This helps us to finance the asset.
