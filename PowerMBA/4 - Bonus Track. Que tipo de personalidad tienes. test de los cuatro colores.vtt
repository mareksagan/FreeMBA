00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.810
Carlos, we've heard everyone talk

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.210
many times about the personality test,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.050
and I think there are a lot of people

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.430
who don't take it seriously, because

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.470
what's been done is, with the aim

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.070
of making them easier to understand,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.410
because it seems that they're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.650
a bit naive, with a lot of color

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.470
and stories of those, right?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.630
But I really believe that it is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.710
a valuable tool that helps you

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.930
understand yourself, that helps

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.130
you understand others, and I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.690
would like you to tell us,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.150
to begin with, what are the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.290
concrete benefits we will

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.050
get using or putting in practice

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.390
a personality test?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.210
Because there is a first benefit

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.450
that we normally always have heard

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.370
the advice of treating others as

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.310
you want to be treated, and that

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.870
to see, it's not bad, but really

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.830
what you need to do is treat others

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.670
as they want to be treated, and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.650
that's a very subtle but very powerful

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.450
difference, because not everyone

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.690
wants to be treated as you,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.290
and that depends on the personality,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.730
and precisely these personality

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.470
tests what they help you

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.690
is to identify the personality

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.990
of the person you interact

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.430
with to be able to treat

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.350
him as he wants to be treated.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.850


00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.710
That is the main advantage,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.490
and then of course there are

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.290
many others, better communicate

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.430
with people, be able to assign

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.350
tasks to teams that work

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.570
in a certain way and have to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.170
understand each other, resolve

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.930
conflicts, but if you want

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.950
to talk about the area where

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530
it is applied in companies,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.910
for example, companies are using

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.330
this type of tools to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.770
select personnel or to form

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.170
sales teams or to assign tasks

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.710
or decide promotions, for

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.250
example, then clearly it is very

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.810
powerful, because in a sales

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.970
team you don't have to have

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.250
just one type of personality,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.290
you have to try to have all

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.390
types of personality

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.150
because customers have all

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.190
types of personality,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.130
not only have one, so if you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.590
do a very monolithic, very

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.150
uniform sales team, you

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.630
are not achieving the goal

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.910
of reaching a broader target.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.270
Carlos, we already understand

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.050
the benefits of doing a personality

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.130
test, then I will tell my case,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.110
how it helped me, above, and I would

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.250
like you to explain to us or

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.230
that we put hands on the work,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.170
we will do it.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.670
Perfect, because we will see

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.010
two types of test or methodologies

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.550
to classify our personality,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.170
one of them is deeper, it is called

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.470
the Myers-Briggs test and good

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.650
because it classifies people

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.150
in 16 different personality

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.410
types according to four axes,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.730
we will leave a link so that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.270
people can do this test, we

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.770
must answer a series of questions

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.730
and take one to make a more simplified

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.650
version, we will explain

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.110
here a more simplified version

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.610
of this test that is called

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.770
the four-color test and instead

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.290
of four axes we classify

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.510
people according to two

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.330
axes, what are these

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.070
two axes?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.310
The first axis is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.850
extrovert-introvert, that is,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.770
each would now have to recognize

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.090
himself if he is more

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.090
introverted, that is, if he is a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.810
more quiet, observing, detail-centered,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.930
individual, reserved, reflective

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.690
person or if he is more extroverted,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.150
speaker, participative,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.870
focused on general ideas, who

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.730
is more related to groups, more

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.690
direct, who says things as he

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.110
thinks them or more of action,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.970
that would be extroverted.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.190
What we have to go do all is,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430
as you are describing the axes,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.170
the characteristics of the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.050
personality, what we

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.870
have to go do all is see where we

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.850
identify, so that is, that's how we

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.410
have to focus this class, I here

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.390
in introverted-extroverted would

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.810
add a question, a criterion that

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.330
you earn energy when you are alone,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.290
you need every day your space

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.290
and there is when, I don't know,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.170
when you charge energy, or it's

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.870
the reverse, or you charge with

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.510
people, and the same question

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.670
otherwise is, if you have to spend

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.070
three days in a row with a lot

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.490
of people, you end up exhausted

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.670
or you charge?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.850
I think it's easy to answer that question,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.210
because people see themselves in

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.090
one place or another.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.550
It is fantastic Borja, because so

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.990
it helps us to place ourselves in

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.570
each of the two axes, there is another

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.750
question that people can ask and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.450
is, in stressful situations,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.910
do we want someone to comfort us,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.470
talk to us, or do we want

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.570
ourselves to go through the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.070
crisis alone or, say, reset us?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.450
That is related to what you said

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.830
before, therefore, it serves us

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.930
to classify ourselves.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.610
I think it's very easy for all of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.430
us to answer that, depending on

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.430
whether we're stressed, like to

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.010
be alone or like to be with more

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.730
people, we're either introverted

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.210
or extroverted.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.950
And one thing I want to clarify here is

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.310
that being introverted or extroverted

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.410
has nothing to do with being nice, it

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.310
has nothing to do with being introverted

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.490
or extroverted.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.050
So reliable, not exactly.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.070
You can be very good with people,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.850
you can be a very winning

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.030
person with other people,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.810
but you are introverted.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.650
I say it because there are people

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.230
who think, introverted, shy and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.110
ranky, then no.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.250
No, it does not have to be so.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.150
In other words, an introvert

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.570
can be a leader.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.590
This is true, and in many

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.050
cases it is.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.670
Well, and the second axis is whether,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.870
when we make decisions, we let

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.470
ourselves be guided more

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.110
by rationality, by the brain,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.950
or more by the heart, by the feeling.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.730
That is, if we care more what,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.430
what is rational, or who, the feeling.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.510
We have the two axes and

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.410
the four personality types.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.170
To, say, classify ourselves

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.410
in a simpler way, we have given color.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.850
The cold colors are the colors

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.750
of the introverts.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.870
Blue is the rational introvert

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.610
and green is the introvert

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.570
who followed the feelings.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.710
The hot colors are those of the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.630
extroverts.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.590
Red is the rational extrovertible

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.250
and yellow is the extrovertible

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.050
that followed by the feeling.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.330
To help us rank in each of

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.670
these blocks, let's identify

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.930
each of these colors

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.950
with a word.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.870
The blue, rational introvert, is

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.350
to do it right.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.210
The green, which is introverted in

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.250
feeling, is to do it with affection.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.050
The red, which is the rational extrovert,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.850
is let's do it now.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.130
And the yellow, which is

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.390
the extroverted guided by feeling,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.910
is let's do it together.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.830
I think this helps a lot so that

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.170
we make every effort to identify

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.050
where we are.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.530
Because it's true that from the

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.570
two axes, well, I think we can

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.670
go making a little idea, but

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.030
sometimes it's not easy at all.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.610
Because there are people who are not

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.550
at the extremes of introverted,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.110
extroverted or rational, emotional.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.190
But as you tell us,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.310
this will help us locate.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.050
There is another goal we can reach.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.590
What causes us stress?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.050
For the blue, what causes them

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.670
stress is the lack of preparation.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.590
They are the rational introverts.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.450
Lack of preparation.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.270
Emotional introverts, what causes

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.530
them to stress is feeling undervalued.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.510
The red, who are the rational

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.910
extroverts, what causes them to

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.010
stress is to lose control,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.310
to have the feeling that they

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.510
have no control over what

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.410
is happening.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.650
And the yellow, who are

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.790
the extroverts guided by

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.610
feeling, feel excluded.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.270
They do not want to feel excluded from the group.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.790
This, obviously, is what makes us

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.510
help to locate ourselves in each

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.150
of these colors.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.170
As you said, we are all a mixture

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.770
of different colors.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.990
There are some that we will be more

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.530
at some extreme, but the normal thing

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.030
is that we have components of the four.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.010
It is a matter of seeing where we

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.090
feel most recognized.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.170
What does each of the four

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.070
colors need?

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.790
Well, because blue needs data,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.390
precision, methodology, models.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.570
Green needs time, values, and harmony.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.310
The red needs action, the practical

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.010
part, alternatives, focus on the

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.430
subject.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.830
And yellow, images, social contact,

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.190
protagonism.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.730
I think it is easy to do this

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.990
analysis from the work perspective

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.330
in our work.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.370
What do we need to

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.490
be calm?

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.790
To be safe and

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.270
to...

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.590
One thing is important, there is no

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.810
personality more innovative than

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.290
another.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.610
They can all innovate, but from different

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.530
perspectives and motivations.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.930
That is the fun.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.390
As you said before, an introvert

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.370
is not someone who doesn't

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.970
relate to anyone.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.130
Instead, you have an introverted

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.950
personality and be a leader.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.110
That is, there is no reason...

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.010
I, watching and doing the analysis, think

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.290
I was born without the emotional

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.370
part, because I see myself

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.830
absolutely above everything.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.810
In red and blue, right?

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.210
But, let's go, something extreme.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.810
I've always been guided by rationality,

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.330
by the brain, right?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.650
Well, for the photo to complete,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.910
blue is impartial, objective,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.310
analytical, formal.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.430
Green is quiet, calm, serene,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.470
conciliating.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.690
Red is positive, bold, firm and

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.290
energetic.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.690
And yellow is cheerful, inspiring,

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.870
animated and optimistic.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.890
I would recommend that you

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.970
do four exercises.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.470
All of us do these 4 exercises.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.110
The first thing is to do the test of

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.350
the four colors for yourself.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.270
With what we have explained, I think

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.870
you can already place yourself more

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.310
in one color than in another and do the

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.010
test for yourself.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.430
The second exercise is to send

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.630
the screen, the characteristics

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.690
of this test of the four colors

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.010
to people who know us to see

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.930
where they place us, to see if

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.050
it matches or not, or if it differs

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.350
from the others.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.830
This is the second exercise.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.530
The third exercise is to test

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.870
the four colors with what we

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.490
know of other people, to see

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.090
where we place them.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.630
The fourth exercise will be where they

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.150
are seen.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.190
One thing is how we see them

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.870
and another is where they see themselves

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.270
to be able to contrast.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.990
Basically, it is done for...

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.430
To do the test is to

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.930
do it and to ask the other

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.330
people.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.870
And then it's to do the test with the

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.370
most important people in your life.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.050
Actually, that is it.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.310
And we will do the same.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.090
We analyze them first and

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.550
then ask them to see if

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.290
they actually share

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.310
the conclusions.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.670
In addition, this can be done

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.850
in the personal area, with

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.910
the people we usually relate

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.310
to, but also in the workplace,

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.610
if we have confidence

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.790
with our colleagues,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.570
with our bosses, etc.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.390
This gives you a lot of valuable

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.690
information so that you

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.710
can use it.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.110
And the last exercise of all, which

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.430
is the fifth, is that we do

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.050
the full test.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.430
The test of the 16 personalities

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.850
of Myers Briggs, which link is www.16personalities.com.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.470
We will give you the link so you can see it.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.330
Because really, people who have done

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.450
the test, according to the website

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.930
that we have given you, say

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.910
that the test is so accurate

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.650
that it is a bit scary.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.830
Look, I mean yes.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.270
I lived in this case two years

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.830
ago, more or less.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.690
After a separation, etc., well, I wanted

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.410
to understand things, I wanted

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.790
to understand things.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.430
About yourself.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.610
And yes, I did the test.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:55.810
Well, more than doing the test, what

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.970
I did was analyze the whole

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:57.470
model, etc.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.290
And I saw myself very clearly in one

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.870
of the 16 personality types, which is INTJ.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.650
Basically, what I saw was that it was

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.850
very extreme, especially in, I'm

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.490
ultra-rational and I'm ultra-intuitive.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.710
So, of course, by being extreme, the

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.770
people you do and you are extreme in

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.410
something, it's easier to identify yourself.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.830
Because if you're in the middle

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.750
of many, it's harder to see yourself positioned.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.430
I quickly realized what kind of

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.130
person he was.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.890
I wanted to search for it on the internet.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.670
And on the internet I saw that there

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.350
were many testimonials and they recommend

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.590
the type of work you have to have.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.750
They compare you to people who are familiar with

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.010
you, who are of the same profile as you.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.430
And it was really scary, because

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.750
I felt absolutely identified

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.990
with everything they said

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.310
about the INTJs.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.970
That in fact is a personality

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.710
of many leaders, of people who

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.870
are able to organize, to build,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.870
to undertake.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.430
He really has a profile like that.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.590
There are many entrepreneurs.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.090
Exactly, you have just that

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.570
guy, right?

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.570
Like, for example, yellow

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.030
personalities, those who are extroverted,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.610
who followed by feeling, are

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.810
usually personalities

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.950
of people who are artistic

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.890
professions, actors, dancers,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.510
that type of people or artists.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.050
It is curious.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.570
This has a great impact on professional

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.710
development.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.830
For example, people who are in medicine,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.790
physical therapy, for example,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.270
tend to be more sensory,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.450
less intuitive, more emotional,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.850
and less rational, etc.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.810
I think that with this exercise

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.570
will be very powerful and

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.950
we will have information

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.630
to use it in our lives.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.910
Anyone who wants to share the

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.930
results in the forums will

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.330
be welcome.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.810
very well.
