00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.750
It is curious that there are a

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.230
lot of people, even marketing experts

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.790
who have spent hundreds of hours

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.370
studying and who have been in a

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.590
lot of years of marketing-related

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.150
profession, but who have not

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.390
acquired one of the skills that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.290
is most valuable, which

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.170
is to learn to use words and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.350
language to convince.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.090
Look at it sounds simple, right?

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.170
It has a bestial impact.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.910
It helps a lot to sell.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.510
It has a much more impact than

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.630
knowing many of the theoretical

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.890
models that are studied in marketing,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.410
right?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.690
And there are people who call this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.850
copywriting, by the way, but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.390
well, we haven't used this term because

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.790
sometimes it seems that when you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.310
talk about copywriting you're

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.690
only referring to the text of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.430
the ads or the text of the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.850
web page.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.550
We have raised it a little and what

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.970
we have learned is to create

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.490
a script, a complete script, a script

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.150
in which all the messages you will

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.330
send to customers are incorporated,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.630
in all the touch points

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.170
and what we do is give it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
a script, give it a structure.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.770
And we did it based on the model

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.270
created by Storybrand, which is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.410
an American consultant who

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.670
is just specialized in this.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.150
They are the best in the world in this.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.770
So what have we learned?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.830
Well, we've learned that the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.890
first thing we have to do is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.370
identify what the customer's

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.030
real desire is and aim,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.390
above all, to connect with it,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.190
right?

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.890
This is the first exercise we have

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.190
to do.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.990
What does the customer really want?

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.090
We have learned to live up to basic

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.370
wishes.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.030
What we need to do is help

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.650
you visualize the problem.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.710
Then we have to position ourselves

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.910
as someone who can help you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.150
solve that problem.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.690
We have to generate trust in customers

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.970
and we have seen certain

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.090
tactics to do so.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.450
It is also important that you let

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.290
him very clear what the plan is,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.610
what the next steps are.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.390
Since we do not generate comfort at

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.070
this point, many customers will

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.150
look for the mental excuse not to buy you.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.230
What we have seen is that

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.870
we have to be permanently reinforcing,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.110
making you see, reminding

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.690
you what the benefit of what

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.650
you will or, that is in positive

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.730
or negative, what you will

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.890
lose or what you will stop

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.930
winning in case you finally

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.070
don't decide.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.670
These arguments will help us when

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.490
we ask you to buy, right?

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.310
Call to action.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.260
It seems to me very interesting

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.080
that we remember the classification

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.480
of products or services according

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.120
to their level of involvement.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720
This is something that is barely

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.260
studied in Spanish business

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.760
schools and we have seen it in

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.440
some American.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.060
Americans are more present.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.220
And why do we consider at The Power

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.620
MBA that it is convenient that you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.300
understand it well?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.940
Well, because really the strategy

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.880
and all the marketing operations

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.540
are conditioned absolutely

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.900
depending on whether your product

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.140
is high or low level of

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.940
involvement.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.900
It has nothing to do with what

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.800
you're going to do, what you're

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.060
going to play with, and so on.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.740
We will go back to the class and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.740
we will understand it.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.460
Let's compare, let's think

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.960
first that we have a high-impact

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.620
product.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.920
It is a product where decision-making

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.780
is more difficult for many reasons,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.680
and among them because

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.380
the economic cost is higher.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.140
Well, in this case we have to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.480
touch certain leverages, we have

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.660
to look for much differentiation,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.820
we have to generate a lot

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.920
of security if we do not

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.400
have a recognized brand,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.060
we have to work above all nurturing,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.500
we have to work on conversion

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.940
either by marketing

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.460
or by selling.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.700
And now you will understand

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.500
the difference when we talk about

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.200
low-impact products that are products

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.860
in which decision-making is very

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.980
fast, it is very simple, they

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.160
are products usually with

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.500
a much more economical price in

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.880
which the customer is not playing

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.500
a lot depending on whether

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.200
you buy you or we will

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.820
play you.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.640
We do not have to work nurturing,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.100
we do not have to work conversion,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.800
we do not have to work sales,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.620
what we have to work

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.640
in this case for example

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.760
is accessibility, it is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.820
convenience.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.020
And if we put the example

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.880
of a food company that sells

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120
through the large distribution

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.180
of supermarkets, for example,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.000
then what will it play

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.380
in?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.880
It will be played in being present at

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.420
a greater number of selling points

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.660
and wherever it is in the lineal.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.470
Segmentation is one of the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.250
basic concepts in marketing strategy,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.950
in fact if we go to what the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.750
theory, the STP model, segmentation,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.530
targeting and positioning

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.970
says, segmentation is the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.350
first step of all.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.210
We may discuss whether before

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.990
segmentation the first step

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.990
is to understand what the problem

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.730
you solved is, what

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.150
the benefit you are generating

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.330
in the customer.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.090
In any case, what we recommended

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.790
in Power MVA is that the main

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.730
segmentation variable that

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.210
will help you most is segmenting

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.830
according to the problem

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.610
or benefit sought.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.410
Why is it?

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.450
That is, if you are able to identify

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.470
within your customer segments

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.810
or maybe you only have one but you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.750
understand well what problem you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.230
are solving or what benefit your

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.350
customers are looking for, if

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.590
you identify different segments

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.870
and adapt the proposals,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.970
adapt the channels, etc., to

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.050
each of those segments, that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.790
segmentation will have a lot

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.870
more impact than if we segment

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.070
in accordance with other criteria

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.150
such as geography, demographic,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.970
psychographic, etc.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.710
That is, it has more impact on you understanding

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.070
that your customers buy you for one

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.530
reason or another and that is what they

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.530
are looking for in you than if they

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.530
are 25 or 38 years old.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.630
It will allow you to adapt much better

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.050
with much more efficiency all your

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.170
communications.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.690
In any of the cases it is very important

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.050
that we know what are the main

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.390
variables or segmentation criteria

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.090
that the classic are geographical

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.970
segmentation, demographic segmentation,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.950
there is a little more advanced

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.910
that is the segmentation by

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.550
profile or psychographic

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.930
in function, because

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.190
good segments according to

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.950
your lifestyle, your personality,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.950
this helps you to

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.090
understand a little better

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.710
to customers, adapt

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.410
a little the messages.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.410
There is another variable segmentation

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.430
that is worth stopping that

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.090
is behavioral segmentation.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.550
In this case, what we do is

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.090
segment all our customers

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.850
based on the actions they

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.510
have previously carried

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.770
out with us, their previous

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.890
behavior.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.550
So imagine that we present ourselves

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.690
based on those who have bought

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.730
us and those who have not bought

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.810
us in a very simple way.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.070
By the way, the segmentation by

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.410
behavior to one to one segmentation,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.750
we no longer speak of strategic

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.810
segmentation, especially

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.470
on the internet and we are all

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.950
living currently that through e-

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.890
commerce, for example, depending

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.470
on the purchases you have made,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.850
the communications,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.330
the offers, the promotions that

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.410
send you, the emails that

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.330
send you, are adapted

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.570
with what you have done

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.130
before.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.670
This is what we are talking

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.150
about segmentation by behavior.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.130
If we go to the marketing

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.710
books to the STP model, for

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.130
example, what you tell us

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.550
we have to segment, that then

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.510
we have to identify Targets and

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.790
that then we have to define

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.890
our positioning and our marketing

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.310
mix, etc.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.470
But really this has evolved

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.170
and what we have learned is that

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.090
we don't have to think about Targets,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.210
we don't have to think about segments,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.790
in masses of customers, we

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.850
have to think about concrete

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.230
people.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.010
So what we learned is to create

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.530
a customer person from each

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.650
of the customer segments.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.670
You will have several customer person and

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.350
you have to describe them well, you

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.610
have to understand them well.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.710
The customer person tool,

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.930
which directs you or recommends

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.230
you to name it, that you write

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.310
it, the truth is that what helps

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.770
you is to do, at least make the

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.210
effort to understand your

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.630
customers as best as possible.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.470
Within the customer person, what

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.550
you have to incorporate is the most

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.030
valuable information for you.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.170
How you use your product, who search

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.510
for your product, how is your day to

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.590
day that concerns you, etc.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.630
The more detail we incorporate,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.830
the better we understand our

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.730
customers and it will be a

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.310
starting point to adapt absolutely

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.210
everything we do afterwards, how

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.890
we impact them, with what messages,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.810
through who,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.710
etc.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.180
The concept of positioning is basic

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.480
in marketing, you have to understand

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.440
it very well.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.660
Positioning is the place you occupy

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.700
in the minds of your customers.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.900
What we need to understand is that

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.040
it depends on the gap of

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.320
competitors, the gap that is in the

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.900
market.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.400
You can pretend to have a certain

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400
positioning, but if your competitors

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
don't let you there are established

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.480
players, etc., because

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.540
you won't get it.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.480
By the way, positioning is very

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.940
related to other factors we

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.840
have seen, such as value proposition,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.300
such as differentiation,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.120
such as brand, for example.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.800
Why do I say it is so important?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.100
Because it is vital that

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.680
we have very clear what we

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.100
are and how customers see us

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.820
and what we want to be.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.060
This is a very basic point

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.280
in a marketing strategy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.560
This, if you don't have what your

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.580
positioning is, what place you occupy

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.660
or what place you at least want to

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.500
occupy in the minds of your

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.780
customers, everything you do

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.920
afterwards will actually do it on

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.480
a foundation that is not solid.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.720
And remember that what we saw

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.000
is some practical tips on how

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.840
to look for a powerful positioning.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.180
We saw tips that what we can

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.720
pretend is first, creating

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.680
a category.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.840
What we can be is the most expensive.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.440
We can look for a positioning

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.120
doing things very differently,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.920
etc.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.090
To understand digital marketing

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.850
well, it is absolutely necessary

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.370
that you have a complete view

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.950
of the funnel.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.150
From all its stages, in each

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.070
of those stages we have

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.190
to understand what are the objectives,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.270
what are the tools we can

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.550
use, what are the metrics

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.470
we have to manage in each

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.130
of those stages, etc.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.070
Then we could be months

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.430
in each of knowing the

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.070
tools for each of those stages.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.490
This has a lot of development, but

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.250
it is very important to have this prior

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.470
view, this view of height, of

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.870
the total of the funnel, of the

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.510
structure.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.210
If we start with the top

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.030
of the funnel, the goal in this

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.050
case is to attract visitors.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.310
I think we will also contribute

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.870
to what is called awareness,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.330
to know us, to branding.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.770
But the primary and measurable

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.930
goal should be attraction of

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.850
visitors.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.630
And here what we saw is that there are

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.550
two very different approaches.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:55.930
We have inbound marketing and

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.150
we have outbound marketing.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.110
It has huge implications in everything.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.550


00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.410
In the outbound, what we do is

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.250
pay, basically impact and attract

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.430
traffic.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.570
It is more immediate.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.250
Paying for traffic.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.550
But it is less sustainable.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.390
It has some disadvantages.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.010
The inbound is a bit more complex.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.990
What we have to do is attract

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.350
traffic, offering mainly attractive

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.030
content, which is attractive

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.290
to our target audience.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.870
We attract them with that content

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.410
and end up on our website.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.190
What we have to understand in the

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.430
inbound is that it is more long-term.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.770
It is healthier and more sustainable.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.070
In the outbound you pay

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.190
directly for that traffic.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.630
Inbound does not have an indirect

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.270
cost, but it has an inbound

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.510
management cost.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.050
But you don't pay for each of those visits.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.680
Another thing to keep in mind, one

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.700
of the great advantages of inbound

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.240
marketing is the quality of

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.740
traffic.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.340
Why is it?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.760
Because you are generating traffic

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.080
that is more skilled.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.060
You are generating traffic that you will

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.920
turn into better.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.780
You have in mind that it is people

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.740
who have been interested or attracted

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.800
to the content you are generating,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.240
who probably share something

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.340
more with you and who more

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.880
freely end up on your website.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.780
So, of those it is easier that you

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.380
convert a higher percentage.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.420
What we saw is almost every

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.520
channel or almost every

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.060
tool, both inbound and

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.020
outbound, to attract traffic.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.240
SEO, social media, and so on.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.700
And here what we have to understand

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.540
well is that what we have to

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.620
do is a mix.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.360
And to make a mix we have to

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.340
understand what are the advantages

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.920
and disadvantages of each of

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.100
those channels, each of those tools.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.920
And we did so based on many

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.820
variables, payback, complexity,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.760
etc.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.880
As I tell you, what you need to do

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.020
is understand them all to

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.640
establish the mix that helps you

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.140
in your particular case, to the

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.340
goals you have defined in your

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.400
digital marketing plan.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.960
We go down to the funnel.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.260
If we go further down, what we have to

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.580
do in this case, we have already

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.320
generated traffic, is to turn it.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.500
Here what we saw, if you remember,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.580
is that there are longer funnels

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.640
in which, for example, we start

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.300
by asking for the data, we capture

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.440
the leads and then we have to

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
do a lead nurturing.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.460
We need to give you information

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.720
to convince that potential

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.120
customer.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.300
For example, remember, by email

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.640
marketing or marketing automation,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.240
automating emails, or

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.920
we also have shorter funnels

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.380
and this is usually low-

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.220
impact purchases.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.620
Consider the classification of

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.460
levels of involvement.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.560
In this case, the key is to encourage

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.100
faster, more impulsive purchases.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.080
This is the case with the usability

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.500
of the website.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.000
We played it in the short term

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.260
and we have seen and seen

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.260
many techniques that will

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.880
help us improve conversion

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.760
rates on the web.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.720
By the way, in any of the cases

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.280
what we can do is use, support

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.540
us in retargeting, which

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.540
is to impact users again,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.900
because users who have

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.940
visited us, who have

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.960
clicked on an ad, who have

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.760
left us their data, who

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.320
are already leads, etc.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.380
It is a very broad concept of

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.580
retargeting, but it is very useful

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.840
because it is to impact again, it

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.120
is to accompany you along the funnel.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.860
Now we go to the bottom

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.800
of the funnel.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.480
In this case, what would be the goal?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.420
The goal, basically, would be

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.160
that those customers who have

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.500
bought us, buy us again.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.460
And here we can use many

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.480
tools we've seen, such as

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.360
re-impacting them through

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.060
email marketing or re-

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.280
impacting them through retargeting,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.220
etc.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.580
By the way, social networks,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.700
which we have not yet talked

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.960
about, are very powerful

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.380
tools that help us throughout

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.660
the whole funnel, help us

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.160
to be permanently present in

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.580
the minds of users, offer

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.480
them interesting content, etc.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.920
And if we go down the whole, it is an

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.540
additional phase in the funnel we

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.400
have incorporated, it is an expansive phase.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.380
Why is it expansive?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.700
Because in this case, at this

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.540
level, what we have the goal

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.760
is that our customers become

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.080
referrals, promoters, who

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.700
recommend us to others, who

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.780
generate more business,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.040
to understand it in a simple way.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.260
Of course, every effort we make in

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.260
this direction has a great impact

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.580
because you have in mind that if

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.620
you increase the rate of promoters,

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.620
because it is an organic way of

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.880
growing, because it is an unpaid

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.840
traffic, it is a way of growing

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.060
much healthier, because you are

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.360
not dependent on the capture

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.520
channels, you are not dependent

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.400
on paying permanently

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.120
that traffic.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.980
To understand digital marketing

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.340
well, one of the most important

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.560
perspectives are metrics.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.360
We have to understand very

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.580
well what the main metrics

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.360
are, which are not many along

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.480
all stages of the funnel.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.780
If we go to the top of the funnel,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.400
the important metrics,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.680
what we have to measure is how

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.320
much it will cost us to attract

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.880
that traffic, the investment

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.580
we have made.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.800
And also the number of visits, the

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.140
volume of traffic we are generating.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.380
This is very simple.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.680
Now we go down.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.860
What do we need to measure?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.080
We will have to measure the

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.520
conversion ratios throughout

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.400
the entire funnel.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.360
If you have a longer funnel, you

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.000
will have more conversion ratios.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.040
If it's shorter, you'll have

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.920
fewer ratios, but basically it'

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.680
s going to see how much

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.180
we're converting of all that

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.740
traffic as we go down the funnel.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.940
One important aspect is the cost.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.360
We need to know ultimately

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.480
how much each of the purchases

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.940
or each of the customers costs

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.840
us, which is the famous CTA

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.860
or customer acquisition cost.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.480
But before we can go to other

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.820
cost metrics above and we

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.400
could know how much each visit

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.320
or how much each lead costs

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.880
us.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.790
What we can never lose from

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.370
sight is the income.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.950
How much will our customers generate?

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:49.970
We can measure the

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.830
average ticket, for example.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.490
How much do we generate in each of

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.310
the sales?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.130
The customer lifetime value is

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.670
what the customer will generate

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.850
throughout their lives.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.510
All these metrics, which are

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.470
not many, we have to

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.030
monitor them constantly.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.530
And that's why we always

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.130
have a dashboard where we

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.630
have all those metrics along

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.370
the entire funnel.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.790
The main ones in your business.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.030
Do not get crazy.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.250
It is preferable that you identify

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.770
four or five and that you manage them

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.710
well, that you get mad with a business

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.910
intelligence dashboard that you

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.770
are ultimately unable to control.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.890
And another thing you have to keep

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.130
in mind is that what we have

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.550
to do is measure.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.470
Measure what happens in the funnel

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.050
for the different customer

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.690
segments or for the different

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.750
traffic sources.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.170
If you are, for example, attracting

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.310
traffic in very different ways,

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.610
segment and measure it separately,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.970
because if you put it all together

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.330
you can be confusing,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.650
you can be asking for

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.070
a lot of information.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.990
It also turns out that there is one of

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.890
the sources of traffic in which you are

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.110
investing money and that doesn'

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.250
t turn absolutely anything, you

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.530
are throwing the money.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.590
That is why we always recommend

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.790
that segment based on the source

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.770
of traffic.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.250
In the end, the management of online

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.710
marketing, digital marketing is

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.850
very simple and what we have to understand

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.170
is what are the keys in each

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.850
of the stages of the funnel.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.750
If we go to the top, what we have

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.990
to do is attract as much traffic as

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.010
possible at the lowest cost, obviously,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.850
but as long as it is of the

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.750
highest quality.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.950
These are the variables, not the slopes.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.570
We're going down the funnel, what

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.990
we have to do is optimize the conversion

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.050
rates, that is, lose as few

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.230
customers as possible, convert

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.290
to the highest percentage

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.870
of customers as possible.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.310
Of course, if we take into account what

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.710
has cost us to capture each customer

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.130
and then calculate the conversion

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.970
ratio, what we will be able to calculate

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.870
here is how much it costs us to capture

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.550
each of the customers, which will

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.670
depend on those two variables

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.530
above.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.950
Below what we have to do is increase

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.550
the average ticket, sell them as

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.730
much as possible or maintain

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.430
or get the largest value from customers

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.730
over time, which is the customer

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.670
lifetime value, which

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.730
will be the value we get throughout

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.150
the entire life of the

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.950
customer.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.330
As you can see, the management of the

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.270
entire marketing plan is very simple

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.230
because it depends on a few leverage

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.450
that we have to understand very

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:10.890
well.
