WEBVTT

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.770
Good morning George.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.950
and good days.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.550
We have Jorge Esnura with us,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.930
Jorge is a person who by his experience

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.390
seems to have, it might seem

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.490
that he is older, but he is a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.230
tremendously young, very entrepreneurial

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.710
person who today will

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890
tell us some interesting

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.130
experiences here at the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.210
South Summit 2017 and we

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.570
want to ask Jorge that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.710
he is 26 years old about

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.510
his professional career.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.490
He is an expert in entrepreneurship

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.870
issues, a person with

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.610
a lot of experience in people

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.450
management and a person

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.750
with a lot of experience

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.050
in go to market

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.730
models.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.310
Then Jorge wanted to start by asking

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.670
you what you are dedicated to, I fundamentally

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.950
know that you are touching two legs,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.370
you are an entrepreneur and

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.430
an entrepreneur and you are also a teacher

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.890
at IE Business School where you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.970
studied the career of Business.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.670
Well, I on the one hand came from mounting

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.730
a previous startup that we started

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.010
in 2011 that was Taiba, was the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.510
largest marketplace of employment

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.170
for startups in Europe, we

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.430
sold it in 2015 when we just

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.510
started a startup with which I

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.670
am currently that is Source.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.010
At Source, what we do is basically

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.550
create the infrastructure

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.070
that analyzes developer code

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.330
through artificial intelligence,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.050
which we then give to other

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.230
companies to create

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.390
their applications

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.270
from this.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.310
In the sense of creating

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.090
vulnerability detection applications,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.090
that is, security, from issues

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.470
of analyzing code to extract internal

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.130
statistics, from programming

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.290
even automated, different things

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.510
that then the companies each

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.650
has a use that they want to

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.370
give to their code by analyzing

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.410
it with artificial

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.350
intelligence.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.870
Tell us a little more about the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.610
business model.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.290
Yes, we basically talk to the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.470
company and we say, you hear what

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.070
problems you have at the level

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.650
of development, you hear because

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.090
you see I have these problems, because

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670
if we applied artificial intelligence

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.810
to analyze the code you have

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.990
within your company, companies

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.110
that have 50,000 developers,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.410
imagine the code they have,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.930
we can solve this problem,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.010
you hear because this is a productivity

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.550
problem, you hear

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.370
because we can create an

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.570
application that what you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.690
do is predict the code while

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.030
a programmer is writing

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.090
it so that you can

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.550
write code faster and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.030
more reliably too.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.950
Or say, hear, pick up too, analyze

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.630
your code, analyze the code

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.970
of other millions of developers,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.390
that is, with yours I mean

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.810
the company and see which

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.970
of those developers would

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.850
fit well there.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.630
Hear how it is monetized, how it is,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.270
the proposal to companies is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.970
clear, you are in the business

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.690
to business segment, you are holding

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.990
a lot of power on technology

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.390
and artificial intelligence,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:03:02.810
how do you charge the customer?

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.050
In that case we do not charge,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.250
then we have an API model where

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.510
it basically makes us, your software

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.410
makes us questions of wanting

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.030
an analysis of this code to do

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.030
X, Y or Z, we return it, there

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.670
is a charge for use and then we

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.950
have the license model that is the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.110
enterprise, where basically

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.850
the year companies pay us X

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.970
for implementing on-premise,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.830
that is, in their servers

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.450
our technology.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.070
I imagine that this type of

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.150
business, the go to market,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.970
is fundamentally based on commercial

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.690
teams that attack the technology

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.010
directors of those companies.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.090
They are two things, on the one hand

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.550
it is the most traditional

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.970
model of effectively having a sales

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.490
team, corporate sales and others,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.390
and enterprise sales, on the other

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.610
hand by being our open source

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.070
technology, by being free code,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.870
many cases that are given to us

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.830
are people of teams of these companies

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.470
that implement or start to traste

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.990
a little with the technology that

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.490
is online and by seeing it and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.190
say that interesting, maybe this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.950
company could help us do this, this

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.250
and this, and then they contact

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.670
us and tell us that so if we work

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.770
together or even work together

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.830
to develop something new

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.330
that then we will do it open

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.310
source, then we have

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.010
here a very interesting

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.670
inbound.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.310
How long have you been in this company?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.830
How did you get it in motion?

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.570
Have you been to a family capital,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.450
friends, a fund?

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.190
How did you do it?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.390
In this case we put it up in 2015

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.290
when we sold the previous company

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.430
we had a fairly simple access

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.190
to capital, in 2016 on the one hand

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.990
we re-invested what we have taken

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.150
from the previous company sale

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.210
in this, and then in 2016 we made

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.430
our first capital expansion of 6

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.190
million euros with investors who

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.270
either knew us already because

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.410
they had invested in the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.290
previous company or investors

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.030
who knew that story and especially

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.810
that they had come for our customers,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.730
the curious thing is that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.250
two of the three investors

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.710
who took that round came

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.110
through customers.
