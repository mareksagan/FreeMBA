00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Cris, let's see how we can manage human capital.

00:09.000 --> 00:21.000
This is very broad, but we need a method, a formula that helps us set goals, evaluate, develop, help you reach those goals.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
This is often the orthodox way, it includes many things, management of performance, management of development, etc.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
But what we are going to do is a unique method.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
That's it, it's a process, we're going to explain it as if it were an annual process, we're going to call it the employee cycle.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
This first process starts with a phase that is the setting of goals.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
You, based on the company goals you have and based on the position that each employee occupies, you have to set some goals.

00:58.000 --> 01:10.000
Once you set those goals, you have to set KPIs, some measurement systems of those goals to see that they are improving and that they are being fulfilled.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
And how is this done? When setting goals, you have to follow the MARTE rule.

01:18.000 --> 01:30.000
A business goal has to be measurable, it cannot be ethereal, it cannot be generic, because that leads to frustration, to dismotivation, something that you cannot measure.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
It has to be achievable, it has to be realistic, you don't ask for an impossible goal.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
It has to be realistic and challenging, it cannot be impossible, but on the other hand it cannot be easy or that it does not have an impact on the benefits.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
It also has to be timed, you cannot set a goal without a deadline.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
You have to set it and say, hey, this year we have to do a number of sales, a number of products, a number of things.

02:06.000 --> 02:17.000
And then it has to be achievable, what we said, it cannot be impossible because it demotivates, but it cannot be something that does not motivate you at the challenge level.

02:17.000 --> 02:35.000
This that seems common sense, we always say, it seems common sense, the objectives are MARTE and everyone has heard it, but when you set the goals, you have to take it into account, because many times those requirements are not met and in the end it is useless.

02:35.000 --> 02:50.000
And then it also helps you to be efficient, to have an organizational and business efficiency, because in the end only the people to whom you set goals are efficient in their work.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
Because if you don't know what you have to do, you can be wasting time and that is a loss of money and time for everyone who is not efficient.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Because working does not consist of doing tasks, it is contributing to business goals and everything else is worthless.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
The goals that you set have to be aligned with the strategic goals.

03:11.000 --> 03:25.000
That's right, it has to be based on the position that each one occupies in the organization and then they also have to comply with the MARTE rule, measurable, achievable, challenging, timed and specific.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That's on the one hand.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
So this first phase is the setting of goals.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
And how do we do it?

03:31.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, you meet at the beginning of the year with your collaborators individually, in one to one, and you set those individual goals of each one based on the company's goals and their position.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay, then I want to see some examples.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
And you set the goals and you set the metrics or KPIs with which we are going to follow those goals.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Exactly.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
If you want, we can set examples.

03:55.000 --> 04:11.000
For example, a seller, you set an annual sales target, with a market share KPI, for example, which would be the expected result, the KPI.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes, yes.

04:12.000 --> 04:23.000
It would be a sales target, for example, a human resources target, for example, improving the work environment.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, you have to design a job climate survey to launch the employees, that's the goal, right?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yes.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
And how are we going to measure it?

04:31.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, you have to set a target, which is the launch of the survey, that the results are also favorable, that there has been an improvement, and that you have also put a plan of action based on the areas of improvement that the employees have told you that you have to improve.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Okay?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
It would be a KPI, okay?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Of a human resources target, for example.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yes.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And then a person, for example, of customer care, okay?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, for example, the satisfaction surveys.

04:56.000 --> 05:09.000
Exactly, for example, that 90% of the satisfaction surveys of our clients have a higher rating than a specific score this year.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
That and, for example, the number of calls, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
That's it, okay?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
To make it effectively measurable and specific, okay?

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, those would be examples of three objectives of people in different departments.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:32.000
So, once you have had that meeting with your collaborator to set their goals, in that meeting you also have to set some development goals.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Why?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Because you have to help your collaborator achieve those goals that you have as a company and at an individual level.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
So, based on that, and I'm going to explain it with the examples we've put, we set some development goals, okay?

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Imagine, hey, well, I'm the seller, you've given me some sales goals, okay?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, I need to develop my negotiating skills to reach these sales goals.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
It is a bit focused on overcoming weaknesses or strengthening potential, right?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It is developing areas of improvement that each person has.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Nobody is perfect.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yes.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
Everyone has things to improve and what happens is that we have to help our people to focus on those areas of improvement to develop them

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
and to achieve the company's goals.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
So, we are going to make individual development plans with each person to achieve the business goals that we have set for them.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
That's it, that's it.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
And they are development goals, that is, they also have to be measurable, achievable, challenging, set in time and specific, okay?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And we are going to follow the same measurement system, so to speak, okay?

06:38.000 --> 06:46.000
So, we set business and development goals in a first meeting at the beginning of the year.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
Can you give us an example of initiatives or development plans to achieve the goals that we have seen?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay, well, with the specific examples?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yes, with some of them.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
We have talked, for example, about the seller, okay?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
We have already said that he needs to develop his negotiating skills.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
We have assigned him a specific training in consulting sales.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Or we send him for 15 days with another seller who is very good at that, for example.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
For example, it may be, because in the end, what we also have to be clear when designing development plans is that people,

07:24.000 --> 07:34.000
there is a rule that says that people learn, 70% of the things we learn, we learn through learning experiences, okay?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
That is, doing things.

07:37.000 --> 07:46.000
20% of what we learn, we learn in the relationship with our colleagues, managers, clients, collaborators, okay?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Which is, well, learning from others, so to speak.

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
And then 10% we learn based on traditional training, which can be face-to-face training, online,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
well, what is understood by a specific training or course, okay?

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
So, depending on these, well, these modalities or learning possibilities,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
you, based on the goal you have for development, you can tell this seller, for example,

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
to go on a market visit with the best seller you have on your team, okay?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
So that he learns from the best, for example.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Or also a consulting sales course.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
Or also, well, that you have individual meetings with him to teach, okay?

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
I mean, those are different development or learning actions that you can design in that development plan.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay, I'm going to do a recap.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
First meeting, we set some business goals, validated with the other person,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
everything very validated, everything very consensual.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
We set some KPIs, which are metrics we are going to use, indicators we are going to use

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
to see if those goals are achieved or not.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
And then what we do is, we are going to help him, through development plans or initiatives,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
to achieve those goals.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And that stays there, the meeting is over, what do you do?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Do you sign?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, in the end it is a commitment.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It is a commitment, I mean, to sign in a way...

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
Generally, you do it on a file, on a document, whether it is Word, Excel, whatever you want.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
In a document that both the manager and the collaborator sign.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
And what they do is, in a second phase of the process, after a while,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
you determine that with your manager or collaborator,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
say, hey, we are going to sit down to follow up on this plan,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
quarterly, or quarterly, or monthly.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You define that with your collaborators.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
And that is the second meeting you have, the monitoring and feedback meeting.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, there are several of those.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes, the ones you set up in a year.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Depending on the monitoring you want to do,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
if it is monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly or semester,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
there will be a certain percentage of meetings of that kind.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So, in that meeting, basically, it is with that template,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
you are seeing how you are going to achieve the objectives.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
So, for what?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Well, one of two.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Either to correct an objective that is not being fulfilled,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
or to keep motivating you to keep achieving it as it is being demonstrated.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And the same with the development objectives.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Maybe, hey, it turns out that you have already had that training in sales,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
and now we have come up with that,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
that you go out with the best of the sellers so that you learn.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, the monitoring meeting is established.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It is very logical.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
In the end, it is to see how things are going.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Indeed.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
It is a monitoring meeting and feedback.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And then there would be the last meeting,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
which is at the end of the year,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
which is where all the annual performance that the collaborator has had is evaluated,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
whether he has achieved or not the objectives.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And based on that assessment,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
the retribution systems that we have talked about on other occasions,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
such as a bonus or commercial incentives,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
a flexible retribution, will be established.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Perfect.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
It is an annual process in which we set objectives

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
that have to be aligned with those of the company,

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
that have to meet the criteria of being in MARTE,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
and development plans to achieve them.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And then what we do is to be close to the collaborators,

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
because if you do the first meeting and then you forget,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
when you go back, there has been so much misalignment that…

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
It is essential in these processes that the feedback is continuous.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Because what you cannot do is wait until the end of the year to give feedback to your collaborator,

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
because you have lost a brutal opportunity to motivate him or correct him.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So, in the end, some inefficiencies are lost.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
So, the feedback has to be constant.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Then you can formalize it or not with this type of meetings,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
but the feedback has to be constant.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
These things are done well.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They have to be done well, they cannot be done halfway.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
They take time.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
You can be a very busy businessman and think that you do not have time,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
and you know this would be fine, but you leave it aside.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
That is what happens to many businessmen.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
But in the end, you have to make an effort,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
because both the businessman and his collaborators internalize this process.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Because it is the only way for them to get it out naturally.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
But if you have to force them,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
this is a process of human resources,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
this is not a process of human resources,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
this is a business process.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Totally. It is strategic.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It is strategic.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
So, you have to make your people internalize it

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
so that this continuous feedback is carried out,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
because it is the only way to achieve your goals

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
and to improve and continue to develop the business.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Perfect. Thank you very much.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
It was very good.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Thank you.
