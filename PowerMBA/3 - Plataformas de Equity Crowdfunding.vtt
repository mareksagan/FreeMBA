00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.920
One of the methods for

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.460
funding a startup is

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.040
equity crowdfunding.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.620
I would like you to explain to us

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.380
basically what it consists of and what

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.000
benefits it has for some and for others

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.940
and what types there are.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.400
In the end, equity crowdfunding

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.840
is about financing, rather

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.100
than funding with a limited

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.860
and small set of investors,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.580
more professional, it is about

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.920
accessing the famous power

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.340
of the masses and is, instead

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520
of having two investors of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.860
100,000 euros, it is to have

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.180
200 investors of 1,000

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.680
euros.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.880
As always, it has advantages

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.980
and disadvantages.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.940
It is important to understand

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.380
why it serves and why it does

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.740
not.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.760
And also the limitations it has,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.800
because there are different

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.420
tastes within the way to do

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.260
equity crowdfunding.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.140
Equity crowdfunding has an important

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.040
particularity and is that everything

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.800
is channeled through a campaign.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.360
So that implies that you have to

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.820
explain very well to investors

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.100
of the platform you have decided

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.800
to opt for, what is dedicated to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.020
your company and what they are,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.800
we have told in another video,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.460
the technology it has, who

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.860
the equipment is, how the market

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.980
is, etc.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.920
Does the platform usually guide you in that?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.720
As always, there are levels.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.180
That is, there are platforms that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.900
are almost software, that is, I leave

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.340
you a site, you upload things

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.980
where you want and public ones.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.700
Almost all have a certain level of

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.320
filter, but the sophistication or

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.940
complexity of the filter level is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.460
one of the important things that

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.860
differentiates platforms.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.800
The most software and the ones that operate

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.880
more as an investor.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.660
The ones that are more software

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.120
are absolutely great for a model,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.980
I would almost say, of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.520
self-service, where, hear, you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.820
get this information, there in

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.960
Globalida, hear, good, great,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.140
has good look, the platform

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.200
is launched to a community

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.140
of investors.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.540
These investors communities

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.940
can take different forms.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.520
There are platforms that the minimum investment

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.460
is 50 euros and others that are

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.660
3 or 5,000 euros.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.640
So, the type of investors varies

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.240
a lot.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.740
That is, we have met companies

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.020
that say, hear, because look,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.240
I am looking for a product

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.280
that is, I don't know, an

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.200
application for taxis.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.240
This can actually be worth

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.120
a 50 per person.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.220
I'm really looking for a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.180
product that's for big companies,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.500
I don't know, because the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.580
other one makes more sense.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.900
One of the super important

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.660
advantages of equity crowdfunding

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.840
is that it's not just money.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.440
In other words, you are actually

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.620
doing a advertising campaign.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.200
You are putting your product in front of

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.360
thousands of people and it is a tremendously

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.700
valuable thing.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.500
This is one of the key differences

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.540
between equity crowdfunding

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.100
and other types of funding.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.680
As for how companies are filtered,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.860
that's where we count the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.500
first huge difference.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.700
As I said, there are two types of platforms.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.360
The platforms focus on trading

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.980
as much as possible and this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.460
has some implications with

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.620
your business model.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.080
And the platforms that focus

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.260
on quality.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.880
In other words, you can make

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.660
money in two ways, with

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.880
quantity and quality.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300
So, the quantity ones seek to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300
make a filter usually much more

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.060
extensive.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.960
Invest in larger sized operations

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.540
and a little more mature

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.440
companies.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.920
And the others invest in more initial things.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.140
So, depending on the moment your

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.280
company is, because you have to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.840
set out where you want to go.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.260
Hear, we are just launched, we

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.300
have an initial prototype and we

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.840
want to have feedback from the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.360
market and maybe raise 50,000 euros.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.580
Well, you might be interested in going

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.720
on this type of platform.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.340
We've been doing this for a while

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.280
now and our business is really working

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.840
well.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.140
And we are looking for an alternative

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.520
way to Venture Capital to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.180
finance us a round of 300 or 500,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.100
000 euros.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.720
They are perfect for this type

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.040
of platform.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.740
The range you usually find is,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.680
I tell you, from 20,000 to 50,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.220
000 euros to half a million, even

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.540
a little more, depending

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.140
on the model.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.260
And it's enough to have a small

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.220
market analysis to know who

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.120
does what.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.520
Then there's one thing that for

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.840
me is, I'm very critical of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.780
equity crowdfunding, even though

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.160
our business goes pretty much

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.600
around.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.960
The business model on

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.820
a crowdfunding platform

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.900
is to pay a percentage

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.660
of the amount that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.980
is traded.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.060
So that has a beauty or look operating

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.300
as a marketplace, but it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.140
also has a problem from my

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.620
conceptual point of view.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.760
And it is that I think as an

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.040
investor, I have a few years of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.340
experience investing, really the model

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.340
is not going to give the company

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.760
the paste and go out running.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.380
But for me the investment

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.040
model of what goes is, once

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.840
I have invested in the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.620
company, to help it succeed.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.600
So, a model that is based only

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.860
on taking a percentage of the company

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.420
and is already there, is a model

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.140
that pushes you to make a

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.000
lot of volume.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.380
The more rotation and more things you have,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.420
the more desires.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.780
It's a model that

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.900
I will have short legs because

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.340
really investing is

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.700
a complicated thing.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.580
And there is another that focuses

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.580
more on working on more analyzed things

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.820
and that even in some cases

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.100
invest their own capital in companies.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.680
And finally, one of the beauty of

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.800
equity crowdfunding is the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.640
fact that the investors that can

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.700
get you in and depending on the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.700
type of platform, it can be

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.880
300 or 20 in one and another

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.400
type, you will find investors

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.960
who want to help you sometimes.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.660
This is often something that attracts

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.920
the attention.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.580
The absolute engagement, interest

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.700
that investors have, having

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.420
invested 500 euros, 2000 euros in

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.000
a company, who feel completely

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.860
theirs and are responsible for

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.280
recommending to their friends.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.380
If you are in a large company,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.380
recommend the product

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.560
internally for use.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.560
So, there's a second derivative that

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.420
often doesn't take into account

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.380
equity crowdfunding that's seen

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.380
simply as a way to fund yourself,

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.220
but that you're actually leveraging

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.520
or supporting yourself in the

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.540
power of a community.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.920
And that's something that's well done

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.940
and there's a lot to do too much about

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.580
the role that the platform wants to play

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.580
in the various points, which can be

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.600
absolutely disruptive and critical to

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.440
your business.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.820
Because in the end, and it is a

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.740
way that we do not forget, the best

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.480
investors for good are customers.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.860
If you have both investors

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.880
and customers, you have

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.780
succeeded.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.220
I will do a look at it and I will

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.840
do it in two blocks.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.420
I will start with the last thing you

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.600
were saying, which are the advantages.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.680
The advantages or benefits of

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.340
using an equity crowdfunding platform.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.020
The obvious is that it allows you

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.500
to finance yourself in a simpler way and

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.100
access a lot of people.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.960
And you've added two, the

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.040
notoriety you're earning because you'

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.780
re doing a advertising campaign.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.540
With thousands of potential customers.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.180
And another third is that you'

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.000
ll get, which is something curious,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.020
that people who have invested in

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.900
very small tokens then feel very partisans

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.280
and want to help you.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.700
So, of course, instead of having two

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.700
partners and if you have 200, because

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.400
that can generate a role.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.180
And then what you did is you have

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.320
actually classified the platforms

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.340
into two types.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.140
We talked about one more software model

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.040
and the other model, I don't remember

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.620
how it's called.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.840
Yes, I've called it more software at

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.700
the end, but at the end you have

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.300
to see a more marketplace model.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.820
In the end, what we're talking

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.120
about is a platform that assumes

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.160
that the group of high-end investors

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.900
are sufficiently trained

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.740
to discern that it's a good

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.660
company and that it's

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.720
a not so good company.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.220
And then absolutely leaves the decision-

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.060
making power in the hands of investors.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.740
That is what curation of the

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.980
content of supply and demand.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.580
In the case of such platforms,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.140
supply and demand are

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.280
absolutely free to enter.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.560
There are filters, no one is

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.460
so crazy to let anyone go

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.120
up things.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.540
But the number of filters and the

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.320
friction you have changes.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.340
And this type of platform, so

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.980
you counted, can be a good option

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.420
for projects in more early stages.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.540
There are some that close large

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.080
volumes of investment, but

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.300
not all, much less.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.880
And then there is another model

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.060
of critical funding platform, which

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.740
I already know you don't like the

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.500
term, which are platforms where

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.380
the control of the projects

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.920
that are incorporated into the

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.180
platform is much larger.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.700
Why is?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.120
Because the platform, as in your

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.680
case of Startup Explore, analyzes

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.460
all the projects that go up.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.920
So you are guaranteeing...

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.980
That we are not the only ones, there

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.680
is more operating with this idea of fixing

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.400
a lot on quality.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.500
So, this type of platforms are an

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.620
option for companies that have a

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.600
little more traction, that have

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.740
been more valuable the business

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.840
model and the round volumes

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.680
are larger.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.540
Usually yes.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.580
It also changes the

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.020
role the platform

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.000
wants to play.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.820
That is, in the first things it is

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.020
usually great, great and you have achieved

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.040
the investment or not, and in the

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.560
second sometimes there is even

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.840
a certain support once you have

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.940
achieved the investment.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.820
It's important, and it's one thing

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.420
I haven't mentioned, also that one

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.360
when called over a critical funding

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.240
platform take into account the

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.400
factor of how many projects

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.520
out of every 10 that you launch,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.220
for example, close the platform.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.600
Because in the end if you close three

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.300
out of 10, because if you are one of

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.880
the three is wonderful, but if not,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.460
that can leave a certain even stigma

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.000
of is that you have not even

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.180
managed to close your investment round.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.840
This is one of the big questions to ask.
