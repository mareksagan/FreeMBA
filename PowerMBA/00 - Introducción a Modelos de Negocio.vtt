00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, I'm Borja Danero, I think you all know me.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
As you know, I'm the CEO of Power MBA and one of the founders of the company.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
But what I want to do today is to present the first of the courses.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
We are going to start with analysis and generation of business models.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
I want you to know that it is not orthodox to start with business models in a traditional MBA.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
And in fact, curiously, in almost no program a specific business model is incorporated.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Which is curious, as I said, because I think it is very enriching.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
I am convinced and I would love to do the test, I wish we could do it,

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
if I asked you today to analyze the business model of a simple business,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
let's think about the restaurant that is under your house,

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
or a car dealer, I don't even want to tell you if we talk about Google or Amazon.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm sure your analysis would be messy, in the best case it would be a messy analysis,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
it would be an unconnected puzzle, with pieces without mounting.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
And what I want and I would love is that after this course, after these first two weeks,

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
you are able to mentally order the pieces of a business model.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
I like to explain it like this, I think we can equate it to understanding the mechanism of a business model.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
For example, I would like that if we talk about any company,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
quickly in your head you order who are the segments of customers,

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
what value proposition has been developed for each segment of customer,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
what is the distribution channel through which those customers arrive,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
what kind of relationships are established with the customers,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
if they are personal through what kind of channels,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
what are the income flows that are generated, how is it charged,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
depending on what, is it a product sale, a service sale,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
is it fixed, is it variable, recurring, is there a subscription, is it licensed?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Well, there are many different ways of generating income and we will understand them.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
What are the key resources?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It is very important to understand it.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
What do we need for this business model to work?

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
What is technology? Are they people? Are they certain assets?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
We have to be very clear about it.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Or what are the main activities in which we have to be good,

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
in which we have to put a lot of focus so that things work?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Or, for example, do we need strategic guidance?

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Do we have to rely on third parties that give us resources,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
that give us knowledge, that help us?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Or, for example, what are the costs?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
What are the main costs of the business model?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Well, when you are able to analyze it with this perspective and fit the pieces,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
your business vision, your ability to analyze, improves a lot.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
And we will also teach you to incorporate key concepts such as

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
whether the model is scalable, whether there are entry barriers,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
whether there are costs of change, whether the income is recurring or not.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
We should be able to analyze how the cash flow is,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
if the operations generate a lot of treasury or, on the contrary, they are being demanded.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I think it will be very enriching and it will help you a lot.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
But I also want you to know that these things are not learned overnight.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
I do not expect you to be a strategic consultant in two weeks,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
capable of analyzing any type of business model in great depth,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
but we are going to lay the foundations.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
We are going to lay the foundations with theory and practice,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
and analyzing cases, so that you can assimilate the concepts.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
And as time goes by and we see more cases, and we see it from more perspectives,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I think your ability to analyze will improve a lot.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
And I also guarantee you that the day you are able to analyze a company in depth,

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
any business model in depth, it will help you a lot in your professional career.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
You will understand the company you are working in better,

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
or if you are an entrepreneur, many of our students are entrepreneurs,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
you will understand your business better.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I guarantee you that you will understand it better.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Or if you are an entrepreneur, or if you are an investor.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
In any of the cases, I think it is one of the skills and a key disability

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
for an expert in the business world to be able to analyze a business model.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, to finish, I want to tell you that we are going to use a tool

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
that is the Business Mobile Canvas.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
It is a tool that I personally love.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
For many years I have been a strategic consultant.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I have had to use many strategic analysis tools.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And I think this is the best there is.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And it is the best there is for several reasons, and one of them is its simplicity.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It is very intuitive, very simple.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
It will allow us to draw any type of business model in a very graphic way.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And it will help you understand it.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
But it is not only used to draw or to describe a business model,

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
but it will also help us analyze it and help us identify possible evolutions

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
of that business model.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It will help us innovate.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It is something that I always say, and it is something that I repeat several times

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
throughout this course and others at Power MBA,

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
and it is that innovation does not really require being creative.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
You do not need to be creative or ingenious.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
To innovate, it helps a lot to have the knowledge, to have the foundation,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
to have the records, because if you have those records,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
it is much easier for you to be able to identify where to evolve.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
It is much easier for you to have a happy idea.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, finally, I hope you really enjoy this course.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I think we have done an excellent job.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
We have met with many very interesting people that you will meet,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
such as the founder of Conta Plus, who later became the CEO of Europa, Esager.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
He ended up selling his company in 2003, I think, for 100 million.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It was a case of bestial success.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
We are going to analyze with him, and from the perspective of innovation

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
in the business model, the keys to that success.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
This is an example, but we are going to see many more.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
We are going to meet Richie, who is a very young businessman,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
and the owner and CEO of Vintage, which is a winegrower group

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
that is growing spectacularly in a very mature sector,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
such as the wine sector.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
We are going to analyze the key to that growth.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
So, I say goodbye.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I hope you enjoy the course, I hope you participate,

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
and I hope that in two weeks, your ability to analyze a business model

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
will be much greater than I am.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Thank you.
