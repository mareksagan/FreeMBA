00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.380
Izanami, one of the challenges

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.840
of a start-up is to get

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.800
the right funding for, well, because

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.060
first it is for the project

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.360
of NAVCA and then to go

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.560
funding that growth.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.300
And the lifetime financing formulas,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.800
which is to go to the bank, here

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.740
are not usually used, right?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.760
No, it’s actually something that

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.720
when you talk to people who

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.080
work in banks you’re surprised,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.640
right?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.520
But in the world of start-ups,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.860
going to a bank for money is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.920
the last option you are asked.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.500
That is, you are thinking about

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
public financing through an ENISA or

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
an ICON or a CDT rather than going to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.600
a bank, right?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.880
This is to give a heart attack

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.920
to someone in the banking sector

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560
because of all the companies

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.740
I know that have grown, many

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.280
companies that are immense

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.560
in our environment, people...

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.860
The bank’s report is the first conversation

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.460
in years in which he talked

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.800
about financing a project with

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.520
bank financing.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.600
And it’s starting to happen, right?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.060
That is, they are beginning to have policies

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.620
of a lot of coin investment, of hearing,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360
if an investor has already validated

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.320
and entered, right?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200
Venture capital is in place.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.740
But it’s far from your culture and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.540
your way of doing things, isn’t it?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.840
For them, they keep talking about personal

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.220
avals, they keep talking about

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.520
mortgaging your home to give you

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.160
the money.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.560
But when they don’t end up

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.880
understanding that we’re playing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200
a game with very high risks in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.640
which no one will endorse a project

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.980
with either their home, their mother’

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.100
s, or anything personal, but

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.140
you’re playing a game in which

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.380
you then multiply too much.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.760
Of course, I think the issue here is

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.720
that the risk is very high, the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.660
profitability is very high and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.360
the banks don’t get into this first.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.400
And in addition, well, you can choose

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.660
bank financing, what happens is that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.980
if you want to support with your property,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.520
with your home, with your family

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.720
an idea that the percentage

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.800
of failure is 90%, because there

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.440
is yourself.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.740
It doesn’t seem the most sensible thing, right?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.340
justly.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.960
So, well, the different

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.180
types of funding we can get.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.700
The first one is called

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.400
bootstrapping, which is like not

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.040
treating your boots and having it forward,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.620
which is a name like very sexy, now

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.940
everything is said in English and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.240
it is more sexy, but it’s how they’

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680
ve been doing business all their

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.580
lives, right?

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.980
It is like Amancio Ortega

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.860
or the English Court Empire.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500
I end up doing that and start with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.340
my own resources and I’m

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.820
going to fund myself from what gives

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.620
me my own operations.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.200
It is my clients who finance me.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.820
Ideally, this would be the best

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.000
way to start a business.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.220
What better way to set up

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.120
a business than to have enough

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.800
cash flow to reinvest and get to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.420
the end of the way with a 100%

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.200
of the company?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.820
This, indeed, is the ideal, but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.340
in certain business models

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.940
directly it is impossible.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.620
and exact.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.740
We talked to Miguel Vicente,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.520
founder of Wallapop, and many other

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.180
companies that share a business

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.300
model of marketplace-rated

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.900
platforms and talked to us

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.400
that in the first years what

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.980
you have to do is to win

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.880
more criticism.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.040
It is impossible that in such

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.120
a model you can finance

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.380
growth with your own operations.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.940
If you can do it, it is phenomenal.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.760
And we’re also back a little bit to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.740
the fact that before we’re innovating,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.940
we’re doing new things that haven’

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.800
t been done before.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.060
So, aspiring to generate enough

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.700
cash to fund this whole

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.200
period of experimentation

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.180
is unrealistic.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.640
The second source of funding we

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.260
have is the famous SFFF, Friends,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.040
Families and Full, which is where

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.440
I am starting to validate

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.900
and I start to pull investments

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.020
from my closest circle.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.260
This is a very delicate point for

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.240
several reasons.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.960
The first is because for a particular

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.520
person, because for your grandmother

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.440
having saved 60,000 euros is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.100
probably the savings of a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.680
lifetime.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.660
You can fund those 60,000 euros

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.640
in three marketing campaigns

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.420
in a month and they are useless.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.860


00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.980
So we have to keep a little of the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.400
magnitude in mind.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.640
How much does it cost to your grandmother

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.180
to save those 60,000 euros or to your

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.560
parents or uncles?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.500
And how quickly you spend them when

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.980
you start playing other things.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.460
And another risk that this type

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.760
of financing has is that you can

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.080
end up with an absolutely chaotic

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.160
corporate structure that makes

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.220
your business no longer attractive

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.440
for external financing.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.720
For a professional investor, a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.020
venture capital, a business angel,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.260
an accelerator, entering a society

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.200
in which the cake is divided

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440
between 15, between 16, you have

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.840
a lot of minority shareholders,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.840
makes the company very

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.880
unattractive.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.420
First, because the entrepreneur is already

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.960
starting from the super diluted starting

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.400
line and there is no room for

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240
more money to enter and get diluted

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.020
at the end.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.440
And secondly because a board of

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.420
management, which is like a baptism,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.740
which is full of people, each one

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.980
that opins, is very difficult to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.680
get an alignment of interests

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.360
of all investors if they are 16

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.420
and also are investors who are

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.400
not professionals.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.080
I respect the Friends, Fools and

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.580
Family, what I would say is,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.480
the advice I would give is, if

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.580
you can start with your money better,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.220
but it is very common, the three

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.520
F's is very common because

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.500
entrepreneurs often don't

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.640
have enough money to start,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.700
and the logical and natural

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.140
is to turn to people around you.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.680
If you can get people to put

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.420
in money they don’t need, you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.020
can avoid a lot of trouble

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.820
because you may think you’re

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.840
going to succeed, but the risk

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.720
is high and compromising

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.320
the wealth or investments

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.140
of people around you can

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.180
put you in an uncomfortable

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.880
situation.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.520
So ask for a money they don’t

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.840
need, in small tokens for example,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.060
and always let your investors

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.200
very clear, eye, this is a very

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.720
risky investment, if we’re

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.840
fine, you’ll earn money

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.360
with this, you’ll multiply

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.320
it by 10, but you’re likely

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.200
to lose it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.900
That is, don’t over-sell, because

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.640
as you over-sell and then fail, you’

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.440
ll get colored and you’ll lose

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.980
friends.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.360
And you’re over selling to people who

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.700
love you and who already have, that

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.280
is, who can’t be objective with you.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.300
You tell your mother, mom, I have

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.600
this idea, such, I don’t know what,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.860
I don’t know how much, and your mom,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.180
let’s, pull the money under

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.240
the stones and your mom won’t have

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.620
that more professional investor

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.820
mindset of analyzing risks,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.440
right?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.120
He will be thrown into the pool for you.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.040
And then, to solve that problem

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.220
of having a board of directors,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.620
that is, a very complex corporate

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.680
structure, a recommendation

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.700
would be, for example, that

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.160
those partners be syndicated.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.020


00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.760
That is, well, I have many minority

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.280
partners, but I make them all

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.900
syndicate, I put a representative

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.720
and then I have a 15, a 10, a 20%

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.520
of my company that is represented

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.000
by one person and that then between

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.960
them in a private pact are distributed,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.260
because if not, it

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.180
makes it all very complicated.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.740


00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.520
actually is.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.940
A further source of funding

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.500
or investment would be incubators

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.640
or accelerators of startups.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.160


00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.400
Incubators is a more early stage,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.800
it is to those you go when you have

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.280
an idea practically in a power point

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.140
and that help and support you during

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.940
the entire phase of validation of

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.380
the idea and an accelerator

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.960
enters more in a more early stage

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.900
stage in which I already have a

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.240
MVP, I have some first clients

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.400
and what they do is give me

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.880
the network, contacts and

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.460
mentoring to grow.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.880
The concept is the same, the difference

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.100
is at what point you go to

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.240
one or the other.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.920
and exact.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.880
What do they bring to you?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.480
It depends a lot.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.920
In this world of incubators and

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.980
accelerators there were data

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.040
from Startup Explorer this year

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.000
that last year grew by 216%.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.160
Read this morning that the Vatican

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.560
has launched its own accelerator

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.120
of startups.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.400
So, we are beginning to have

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.380
an ecosystem that, look, is very

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.300
good, because in the end this is

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.700
a funnel.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.880
The more startups feel at the start

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.860
of the funnel, the more successful startups

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.080
we will have at the end.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.460
But you also have to be very

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.920
careful because we have accelerators,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.420
professional incubators that do

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.720
it very well, that take a lot

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.340
of time and that provide you with

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.360
money, provide you with a space to

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.580
be, that is, give you free offices,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.560
provide you with networks of contacts,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.480
provide you with access to subsequent

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.400
capital, that is, they are accelerators

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.720
that already have contacts

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.540
with investors who will

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.920
present your project.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.220
That is, if you don’t have the network

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.980
and don’t have the money and you

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.020
want to undertake, you have an

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.540
idea, really what seems logical in

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.260
this situation is that you rely on

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.920
an accelerator.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.160
But you have to be very careful

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.820
because in the end there are cases in

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.800
Spain of accelerators that neither

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.880
give you office nor give you money,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.440
give you sporadic mentorships and are

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.120
asking you for high percentages

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.720
of your company in exchange

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.180
for a lord with more experience

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.560
than you, once a month to tell

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.400
you two things.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.240
Yes, what happens is that I understand that

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.240
there are people, there are entrepreneurs

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.800
who don’t know who to turn to, they don’

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.400
t have where to go.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.100
Here the main advice would be, and this

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.860
is a advice that Cavídez gave me

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.840
at the time, that if you really believe

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.620
your project, if you really believe

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.760
what you are doing, the most expensive

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.000
thing you have is the percentage

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.600
of your company.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.420
So at first it is very easy

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.560
to use the capital to get

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.680
a uncle who develops the app

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.260
or to get a uncle who gives me

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.620
a name, but sharing that capital

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.760
very lightly at first

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.780
is mortgaging you in the

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.960
future.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.800
So, there are incubator accelerators

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.320
that can mean, not the success,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.900
but a very good start

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.260
for any start-up, a very

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.140
important push.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.880
We have a fantastic example of Y

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.620
Combinator in the United States and there

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.980
are others that can hurt you.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.380
There is a good saying that in

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.560
the gold fever, the one who earned

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.800
the most money was the one who

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.640
sold the pans.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.820
So, to models and markets of these

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.660
that are growing so fast, with

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.080
financing rounds so juicy as those

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.380
we have had in recent years, there

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.380
is a lot of shrinking blood that

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.480
is drawn to see what happens and that

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.800
with putting a billar and a pair

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.820
of chulos sofas and saying that

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.800
you give mentorship, they are taking

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.520
people 5%, 10% and 15% of their

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.860
companies.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.820
You have to be careful and see well.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.160
Yes, but it is good for our students

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.560
to know what an incubator, an accelerator

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.040
provides them with and I encourage

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.220
those who are in this phase to investigate

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.760
which ones are in their country

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.800
and to evaluate which ones

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.680
are the best.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.480
The next source of funding that

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.220
we could apply to would be

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.100
Business Angels.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.820
What is a Business Angel?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.680
A Business Angel is usually an

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.540
entrepreneur who has sold one, two,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.980
three several projects and who

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.060
is using that money he has earned

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.640
from his own projects to reinvest

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.640
them in projects that are

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.200
starting.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.300
They have various motivations.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.900
They have the motivation to

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.580
bring all this I’ve learned

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.180
in my recent projects to

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.440
help someone get it ahead.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.100
They also have some conversations with

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.880
them and have that point to return.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.260
I have also been away, I want

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.100
to return a little society and

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.460
also because it is fun for them.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.420
Entrepreneurs like to throw things

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.660
and have the opportunity to

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.480
accompany someone.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800
By definition, a business angel in

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.480
addition to money usually gives you

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.560
a lot of know-how.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.220
He is a guy with a lot of experience

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.380
who has already been through several

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.340
times for what you are going through

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.280
at that moment and who can contribute

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.460
a lot to you at that stage.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.280
Real and powerful business angels, there

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720
are few.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.300
For many years, I remember ten years

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.120
ago, it was already a talk of Business

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.540
Angels, it was a whole lie.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.860
But currently, effectively, people

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.420
who have made good successes do what

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.560
they do is reinvest in companies

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.380
younger people and others.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.720
This is something real and helps.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.120
And here, like in the accelerators

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.120
and incubators, the same

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.840
happens.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.160
That is, there is suddenly a

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.220
lot of investor, a lot of Business Angel

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.540
that comes from other sectors,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.220
not necessarily technological, because

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.680
a person who comes from an industrial

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.880
sector, who has sold something industrial,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.600
who has said, this is the Internet,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.040
that money is earned and they

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.220
get to invest.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.400
You have to be very careful here

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.760
because the expertise of this guy

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.940
has nothing to do with what you

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.680
will need.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.580
That is, the path he took to launch

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.540
his industrial company is diametrically

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.020
opposite to what you will

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.660
need and the network

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.860
of contacts he has can not

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.380
provide you much.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.260
So, you have to be very careful

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.880
with the partners you choose.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.020
This was a advice that I was given

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.020
in a box that I didn’t apply for

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.060
anything, that is, hear, investigate

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.520
you too to why someone wants to

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.840
give you money, you don’t have

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.640
to accept it at first.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.740
That is, you also have to

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.020
ask the investor questions and

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.760
you have to make sure it will

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.680
be aligned with your interests,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.420
because a project can fall by

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.600
a bad team, but you can also

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.200
fall by having some bad investors.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.960
A step further, we go to

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.760
Venture Capital.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.920
Venture Capital is usually another

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.140
profile, that is, a Venture Capital

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.780
at the end they are entrepreneurs

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.120
in themselves, because it is a

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.300
group of people with experience

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.820
in the sector who do what they

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.260
do is raise a fund of financing,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.780
they look for larger investors,

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.600
family offices or larger

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.960
companies that give them money

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.600
so that they in a certain

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.720
period of time invest in

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.140
projects, invest in

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.000
startups and get them

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.720
a return.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.980
Usually the figures they handle

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.000
is, you hear, we know that from

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.240
ten projects we will get out

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.980
well two, then multiplying, making

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.340
one by ten, in five years

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.480
I will have a profitability

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.260
of 15%.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.960
Yes, something like that.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.420
We have been talking with Javier

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.740
Torremocha and gave us data on

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.860
the profitability they expect or

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.120
the average ones they are getting.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.900
This makes the way they invest

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.180
and the relationship they

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.460
establish with entrepreneurs

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.120
very specific.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.800
One thing that marks their relationships

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.740
a lot is this five-year

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.300
period.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.180
A point comes when Kibo or any

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.500
other Venture Capital has

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.080
to return the money to its investors.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.740
This makes it possible to set

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.360
periods of de-investment and that

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.520
they in the partners’ agreements that

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.560
sign with you have a relative hurry

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.260
to leave.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.180
That is, basically what I want

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.260
us to understand is that Venture

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.440
Capital comes in to accompany

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.600
you for a while but comes in

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.180
to leave.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.080
and exact.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.700
And it comes with the intention

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.160
of multiplying by 10 or 20

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160
its investment, which, as we will

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.260
see in later classes, determines

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.200
that a project is investable or

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.400
not.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600
Because you can have a viable, fantastic

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.860
project that makes you win a lot

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.560
of money, but that is not reversible

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.840
because the investor does

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.700
not see that it has an outcome

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.080
or can make that multiplication.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.440
Basically, if you run a bar, the

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.360
bar won’t be worth 10 times more

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.880
in life.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.720
It will generate a cash flow.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.200
You will not be invested in a venture

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.880
capital.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.100
and exact.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.740
Another form of funding

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.900
is a media for equity.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.820
What is a Media for Equity?

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.740
A media for equity is when I already

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.500
have a product, I already have a product

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.940
validated and I have a few first customers

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.520
and I talk to large television

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.460
groups, with Atres Media, with Mediaset,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.040
with Movistar Plus, so that they

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.780
give me visibility and advertising

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.500
on their channels in exchange

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.960
for percentages in my company.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.400


00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.580
I cannot afford to spend 10 million

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.520
euros on a big television campaign

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.340
where I compete with a Coca-Cola

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.740
or a Renault, but I have a percentage

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.120
of my company that I can

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.360
give in exchange for that

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.940
visibility to the valuations

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.280
that are managed.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.820
Instead of hiring it you, which is very

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.520
expensive, and that it is very possible

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.820
that you do not have the ability,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.180
that you do not have the money, what

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.920
you do is that you share your company

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.660
with this group, with

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.060
the media and they position you.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.660
Plus then you have a very powerful

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.120
strategic partner that can help

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.560
you in other things, we will only

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.480
see it in detail.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.740
We will see it in more detail because

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.920
in Spain we have some very good

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.580
success cases, we have the red fridge,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.020
we have Globo, we have Jovan

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.420
Talent, we have Chick-Fi, we

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.720
have many examples that this

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.260
has been done very well and

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.420
has worked.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.400
People who are outside of this

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.220
world don’t know it, but it’s also

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.500
true that very few companies have

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.460
the ability to make an agreement

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.000
with a communication

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.500
group, because there are few

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.260
companies that can be

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.080
attractive, that have

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.640
huge ratings.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.640
Exactly, and that they have a

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.180
product more market enough for

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.380
this sales channel to serve you,

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.660
because I can have a fantastic

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.540
B2B company, for example guys from

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.000
Typeform who have a very good service,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.880
but it is more a B2B and would

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.440
not make sense, it is

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.880
not your channel.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.780
Then companies that are B2C,

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.800
which have a much more market

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.360
product and that have those

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.800
valuations so high as to

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.180
make a median for equity, there

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.320
are few, but in cases where

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.460
the truth is made it usually

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.760
works very well.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760
Well, then I’ll make a final

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.540
review.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.400
How to finance your startup?

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.740
Ideally with your customers.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.320
Ideally, your business model will

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.060
allow you to generate a cash flow

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.420
that will allow you to finance that growth.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.780
Sometimes it is possible, sometimes not.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.200
The first steps are usually taken with

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.220
your money and by resorting to Friends,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.240
Fools or Family, which is asking

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.120
for help from those around

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.760
you, who have already commented

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.260
that there are risks and have given

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.380
a series of guidelines that

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.640
our students should have very clear

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.960
and do.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.020
You can use incubators, accelerators

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.640
that help you not only by providing

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.060
you with funding, but also give

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.880
you a certain structure

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.540
that is as if you were funding

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.980
because you save certain

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.000
things of structure,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.220
fixed expenses, offices,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.080
etc.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.300
You can go to Business Angels

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.740
which are mostly the most interesting.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.140
They are people who have had success

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.460
by doing previously, who have made

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.420
a good success, that is, who have sold

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.540
their company, have earned a lot

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.420
of money and who have the money

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.620
and the know-how to provide to other

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.260
entrepreneurs.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.560
And this is a lot.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.060
There is a lot in the environment

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.600
of good projects.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720
And the environment I know in Spain,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.560
the most interesting projects

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.920
are all participated

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.160
by people who also, by

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.420
success cases that have already

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.600
sold.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.300
We talk about venture capital,

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.200
which is a more professional investment,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.080
which are funds that are created

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.100
to invest in startups with a

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.700
period of time and that we will

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.800
analyze in detail in another

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.200
class.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.520
And lastly you talk about media

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.320
for equity, which is that instead

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.040
of hiring campaigns in mass

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.800
media like television, radio, etc.,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.360
which is very much money, what you

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.660
do is give a percentage of your

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.140
company that is very attractive,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.100
you give it to a media

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.500
and you change it for that space

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.240
in the media.
