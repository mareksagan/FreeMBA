00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.200
To finish what we’re going to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
talk about is the importance

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.500
of psychological factors

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.420
in pricing.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.480
It’s something that is quite

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.380
interesting and very curious and

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.360
I’ll share with you some of

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.440
the main effects.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000
At the end of the use of psychology

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.180
to define prices, which allows you,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.320
is something that is not easy,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.460
but what for that price or increase

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.680
the average ticket appealing

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.020
to certain psychological factors.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.580
I will give you some examples.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.480
There’s one called Anklage, which is

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.580
Anchoring in English and you’ll understand

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.000
it well.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.700
Look, this is a saying that is very

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.380
common in trade, which is how is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.620
the best way to sell a watch for two

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.480
thousand dollars?, which is a expensive

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.060
watch.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.880
The best way is to put it next

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.620
to one in ten thousand, because

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.940
at that time the customer is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.720
perceiving it as an opportunity,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.680
as a cheaper watch.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.460
If you put it next to one in fifty,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.660
it’s much more complicated than

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.280
selling it.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.440
You will understand this with

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.200
this example.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520
Imagine you go into a store and you’

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.240
re going to buy a TV and you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240
have two options.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.260
And you have a fifty-inch TV that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.620
costs a thousand dollars.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
And you have next to you another forty-

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.320
eight inches that almost imperceptible

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.560
the difference.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.500
Just two inches.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.380
It costs six hundred dollars.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.260
I think everyone is thinking that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.520
the second is a chance.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.540
And it’s very likely that the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.700
retailer really did what you

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.200
want you to think is that.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.140
And it could be until

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.280
the fifty-inch TV had

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.300
a much higher margin.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.520
And what you want is to buy the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.800
forty-eight, but you’ve got it.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.180
Because when you make the comparison,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.300
you have that perception.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.760
This is now being used by

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.220
many companies that offer digital

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.480
products and services.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.260
Especially software companies

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.380
that offer three price

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.560
plans.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.520
And you know that we usually tend to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.440
always go to the middle.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.500
And they are also driving us to that price.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.860
We have a plan in which they

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.620
offer too basic functionalities.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.900
A plan that is the cheapest.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.160
Maybe another very premium.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.240
And what they do is guide you toward what

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.560
they know you’re going to buy.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.220
It is the middle.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.840
I’m going to share with you an

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.580
experiment that was done with beer.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.600
In this experiment the mass,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.780
i.e. the basis of the study,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.020
were only five people.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.920
It’s very low, but I think it’s

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.920
quite representative of a number

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.700
of conclusions.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.280
They started by offering two beers.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.780
One beer for one for eighty dollars

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.380
and another beer more expensive for two

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.920
and a half.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.280
And what they checked out is that four

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.400
out of five people what they did

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.680
was choose the most expensive one.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.220
The two and a half.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.620
Why is?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.800
Because it is a very low ticket and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.860
the price sensitivity is very low

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.840
in such quantities.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.120
You’ll drink a beer, almost like

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.180
you don’t care.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.720
You go to the most expensive, which is definitely

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.260
the best.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.540
So what they did is let’s see how

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.080
it affects the fact of respecting

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.280
these two prices and incorporating

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.980
a slightly more economical option.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500
Because there are people who want,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.680
I don’t know, that there are people who

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.660
have more sensitivity to the price

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.980
that they want to buy the cheapest.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.640
The result was very bad.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.440
The cheapest one they got

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.820
first was not bought.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.160
Instead of four out of five

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.580
people choosing the two-and-

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.420
a-half-euro price, four

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.960
out of five people chose beer

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.400
for beer with an intermediate

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.520
price of eighty.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.020
They had reduced their average

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.500
ticket considerably.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.280
Well, the conclusion, that was the best.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.360
If you want your customers

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.880
to buy beer that costs

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.740
$2 and a half, you have

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.540
to put one more and put

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.120
another more expensive.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.680


00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.380
And it worked, because 85% chose

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.640
the two-and-a-half euros.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.540
I think this is something that we are

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.900
all very aware of when, especially

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.440
in products that you don’t know or

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.880
that you know little or that there

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.440
is little comparative,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.900
you usually tend to discard the cheapest

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.340
and discard the most expensive.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.240
What we have seen this

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.920
experiment is proof of that.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.020
Another psychological effect

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.180
we have to consider is that we have

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.280
to help customers make the decision

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.460
and I’m going to share

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.100
with you another experiment.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.840
They were offered two chips, two

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.100
packages of chips that were different

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.180
but at the same price.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.400
Well, it turned out, it was curiously

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.220
that when the chips were offered

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.300
at the same price only 46% of

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.840
people bought because they

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.040
were in a block section.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.040
Costly to choose, you were not

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.380
helping the customer to One of the packages

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.680
a little more expensive than the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.700
other, what will happen?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.620
Well, what happened is

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.740
that 46% of sales

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.060
closed in a 77.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.880
It is the proof that if we help the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.220
customer make the decision, if

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.740
we overcome that blocking situation,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.840
conversion is much easier.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.960
Another effect that we have to take into

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.500
account and that is also that it is ultra-

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.680
controled, which has an enormous

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.000
impact, is what they call in English

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.820
fear of missing out, which is something

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.800
very human and is the fear

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.340
of losing something.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.220
And for example on Amazon we can see

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.660
it because good on Amazon and in

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.980
many e-commerce in which when you are

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.480
going to buy something they are

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880
warning you of the units that

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.960
remain or that they are few and they

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.160
are appealing just this and they

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.900
have it ultra proven that it works.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.420
In the case of, for example,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.420
platforms like Booking still take

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.660
you more to the extreme because

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.780
they are always permanently

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.000
when you are looking for a hotel

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.480
tell you people who are seeing

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.020
it to the places that remain etc.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.140
It’s something you have to know

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.600
and you should use if you have the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.340
opportunity to do so.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.980
There are other very psychological

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.400
factors that are very curious and that

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.000
almost common sense here does not

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.040
apply but that knowing them

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.760
can come well.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.800
For example, it is proven, ultra-

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.400
proven, that men when we see prices

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.840
or discounts in red respond better

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.460
than if they are in or for example

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.140
this study what was done in

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.620
a menu put prices in three

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.080
different formats at different

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.500
times.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.460
One put the symbol of the dollar in

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.800
another did not put the symbol of the

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.240
dollar and in the last what was

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.580
done is to write it put the

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.100
word dollar.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.340
Well, it was found that customers

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.980
responded better when the dollar

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.340
symbol was not put and the

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.660
shorter the price was, the

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.060
much better it is better not

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.740
to put decimals etc.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.540
Another curious thing that seems

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.620
stupid but works is that if you

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.700
put the prices smaller the

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.960
customers perceive that they

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.040
are cheaper.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.300
And finally we’ll end up with

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.720
something we’ve all put up many

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.780
times and that’s why everyone puts

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.180
the prices finished on in the 9

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.800
because instead of putting 500

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.080
499 399 100 99 etc.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.440
They are mainly two factors one

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.240
is that we tend to stay with the

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.460
first number and not with the last

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.180
and two is that curiously and this

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.940
is more difficult to understand

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.820
curiously always work better prices

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.100
that have a 9 than when they have

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.640
another type of digit and for example

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.700
it was found that making a discount

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.940
of 60 what was done is a discount

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.540
of 60 to 45 dollars compared

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.520
with making that discount

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.860
of 60 to 49 dollars.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.360
Common sense tells us that the

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.740
discount of 40 to 65 that is greater

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.800
that discount would have worked

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.660
better since curiously not.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.320
Interestingly, it worked better from

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.500
$60 to $49.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.060
Well as we have seen these are

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.520
several examples that human

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.000
psychology is very complex but

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.640
it is proven that it works so

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.840
it is convenient to know

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.780
them and use them to the

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.620
extent possible.
