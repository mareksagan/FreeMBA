00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.080
I will start by quoting a quote from Peter

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.080
Drucker, who is one of the greatest

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.920
gurus of management in the 20th

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.620
century.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.820
You can't manage what you can't measure.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.500
You can't manage or you won't

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.900
be able to manage what you're

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.560
not measuring.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.880
This is the first lesson we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.300
have to learn from this class.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.360
The metric, the metric

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.520
we use, is very important.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.960
That is what Peter Drucker said.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.820
Anything you are not measuring on

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.400
a daily basis, that you are not encouraging

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.220
people to do so, that is not

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.180
on the CEO's mental agenda,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.100
the board of directors,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.920
etc.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.300
Everything we do not measure will

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.720
not be managed, we will not focus

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.140
on it.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.180
And ultimately, therefore,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.220
the metrics you use are

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.780
absolutely determining how

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.400
you'll manage your business.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.520
Well, what we are going to do today

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.920
is that as we want to become one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160
we have to incorporate metrics

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.680
that help us to do so.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.080
And we'll do the exercise of thinking

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.880
about what are the metrics that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.480
have always imported us all.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380
And I want you to think about your

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.320
company or the company you work

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.040
for or the companies you've worked

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.720
for throughout your life.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.630
Well, because mainly I would

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.110
say that they are sales, it is

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.550
the most common metric that we are

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.930
always measuring and as the company

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.090
is bigger, because we measure

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.490
the metric with greater recurrence.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.590
We measure metrics on a day or a month

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.870
or on a month or a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.010
year mainly, etc.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.030
We also always measure sales

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.570
increases from the previous period,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.890
whether the last month or the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.970
month of the previous year.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.170
This is something that always

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.490
obsesses us, we are always measuring

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.850
sales.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.150
In the organization they are measured

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.450
by department or if we talk about

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.170
a commercial structure, we have

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.250
commercial, commercial

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.130
delegates, that commanaux, etc.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.330
What they do is measure

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.430
sales for each of those

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.470
people and assign sales growth

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.870
goals to each person

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.190
in the trading force.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.910
I think it sounds like something

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.650
all this.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.990
What other metrics always

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.070
matter to us all?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.870
EBITDA, net profit, for example,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.030
or if we are talking about a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.230
level of quoted companies, etc.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.770
We could also include the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.370
stock market.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.910
Well, in any case, I'm sure you're

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.110
with me that these are the metrics

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.110
that are in the minds of everyone

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.890
and that are the ones we say

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.150
are the engine, it's what

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.790
we monitor to always try

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.770
to maximize, optimize, etc.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.850
The question is, are these metrics

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.690
we've seen really representative

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.290
of the value generated to the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.470
customer?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.910
The answer is no, not directly.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.890
I will give you an example.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.490
You can be measuring sales

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.270
growth every month and you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.150
can grow a bit by a percent

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.470
in sales.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.430
However, it can be assumed that this

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.170
can be done so that the value generated

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.630
to customers is less and less,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.650
you can be giving that customers

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.130
are giving before they are

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.130
down, they are more dissatisfied,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.050
etc.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.150
You can grow for many

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.830
reasons.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.150
It may be because you're investing more

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.230
or better in marketing, it may be

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.690
because you're increasing your trading

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.970
power, because you're pushing

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.850
your products, but this is not

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.810
sustainable.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.630
This is a too short perspective.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.150
Well, what we have to do is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.550
incorporate metrics that help

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.430
us to be a more customer-centric company.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.990
This is the most important thing in

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.590
today's class.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.890
We will never forget about

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.450
sales, profits, etc.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.070
It is impossible to forget that.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.630
But we have to incorporate other metrics

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.210
and they have to be really

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.530
important for the entire organization.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.130
Let's see several.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.730
The first is the customer lifetime value.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.270
Rather than thinking about customers

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.390
in aggregate and looking like they

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.390
were, imagine, we have a bag with

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.030
all customers and what we do

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.370
is see how much sales we get

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.790
out of that bag or how much profits.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.650
Now let's think about the value

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.450
generated by a customer throughout

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.150
his life.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.010
Why is it important to think so?

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.770
It forces you to change your approach.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.990
When you think this way, you are

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.090
really thinking of each of your

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.190
customers as an asset, as

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.010
an investment you have made and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.050
that you have to make a

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.850
profit throughout the customer's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.230
life.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.690
What is the customer lifetime

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.390
value?

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.370
Well, it depends on several factors,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.290
but between them depends on the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.530
time that the customer is as

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.330
a customer.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.790
That it is very representative that

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.870
the customer is satisfied, is obvious.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.630
Another metrics that is also

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.310
related to this is the chance

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.390
rate, which is the percentage

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.530
of drops we have in a period

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.010
of time.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.550
If we systematically monitor the chance

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.670
rate, we will get a lot of information

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.470
about whether customers are more

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.250
and more satisfied and are less

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.770
down-and-down or the opposite.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.730
Another key metric is repetition.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.870
A customer who repeats is a satisfied

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.150
customer.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.510
We can measure repetition in very different

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.170
ways, but we would have to

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.350
incorporate metrics that represent

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.090
this, whether they repeat, whether

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.170
there is fidelity, whether

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.910
there is loyalty, whether there

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.170
is engagement, etc.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.430
The caseistics are very different, they

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.590
can be measured in very different

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.930
ways as I said before.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.710
The last metrics I'm going to talk

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.710
about is the Net Promoter Score,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.330
NPS, which is accepted as the

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.210
best indicator of customer experience

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.550
and I'm sure you've received

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.210
NPS surveys, I'm going to

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.350
share this on screen.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.510
You are asked from 0 to 10 to

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.970
what extent you would recommend the

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.210
product or service to a friend.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.150
I want you to understand what the

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.070
NPS tells us.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.530
It turns out that your promoters,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.270
those people who will recommend

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.810
you, give you a rating of 9

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.510
or 10.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.370
Those that are neutral or passive

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.110
will put you a 7 and an 8 and 6

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.810
down are tractors.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.570
They are customers who will either

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.790
talk badly about you or probably

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.770
won't buy you again.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.910
This may seem too exaggerated,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.070
but you think

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.430
so.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.670
We'll think we'll go to a

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.750
restaurant and we love that

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.510
restaurant and on the next

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.430
opportunity we have we recommend

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.930
it to our friends,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.870
etc.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.350
Or put it in a whatsapp

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.270
group, I'm delighted, I

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.130
recommend this site.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.710
What note would you put?

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.310
You probably put a 9 or a 10 to

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.250
that restaurant because a restaurant

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.690
you put an 8 or a 7 is fine,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.130
but as there are so many

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.790
you won't recommend it.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.510
And a restaurant that you put a

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.230
6 down is very likely to not

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.270
return.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.710
I want to make two more nuances by

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.970
comparing the traditional

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.150
metrics that we all have always

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.470
measured and we will continue

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.410
to measure with the more customer-

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.270
centered metrics.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.510
I want you to keep in mind

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.930
that traditional metrics are

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.030
easier to measure, because

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.170
sales, profit, etc.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.470
It is pure accounting.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.550
However, if we want to measure the

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.930
lifetime, the customer lifetime

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.410
value, the chance rate, etc.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.750
The nps, well, because it is true

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.950
that we need a little more sophisticated

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.130
systems, but well, it is more

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.570
and more easy to do it and it

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.250
is worth it.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.190
And the last precision and is of

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.010
the most important, because it

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.190
is absolutely strategic, it is a

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.490
paradigm shift, is that if you are

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.910
thinking only in the short term,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.170
most likely you are thinking

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.750
about the sales of the coming month.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.210
But you have to overcome this,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.610
you have to overcome this myopia.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.810
What you have to do is really

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.730
understand, validate, that the biggest

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.070
asset you have are your customers and

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.570
the ability to generate more and more

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.670
value to your customers will determine

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.610
what your company will generate

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.470
profits in the medium and

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.330
long term.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.950
What happens, and it is true, is that

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.450
there are decisions aimed at

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.650
increasing the customer lifetime

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.190
value, deducting the chance rate,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.330
etc., which do not have to have

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.110
an impact on sales the coming month.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.950
So you have to overcome, you have

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.610
to overcome the short term, you have

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.850
to think a little more long-term

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.130
and this in many cases is very

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.090
difficult.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:49.430
We have worked with sales of the

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.530
corresponding period.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.410
It is very difficult for them to think about

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.150
the value of their customers, the value generated

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.950
like that.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.450
It is very difficult to worry about

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.190
the chance rate, because they

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.310
are absolutely short-term oriented.
