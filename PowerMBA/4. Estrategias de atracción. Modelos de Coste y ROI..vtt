00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.080
The first thing I want you to keep

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.840
in mind is that we are talking about

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.400
performance marketing or

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.960
results marketing that consists

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.260
in that we will pay based

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.820
on the results that that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.200
campaign gets.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.720
We will pay a variable

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.740
based on the results.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.860
And there are a number of

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.960
very common cost models

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.340
that you need to know now because

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.300
all campaigns are hired

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.400
based on these cost

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.940
models.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.340
When you are going to hire

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.960
a campaign to a specific platform

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.300
or channel, etc., because

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.080
you make an offer associated

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.280
with any of these cost models.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.760


00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.300
Not only is it necessary to be

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.120
able to hire campaigns, but we have

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520
to understand these cost models

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.560
because it will help us analyze

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.720
our internal costs throughout

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.520
the whole funnel, it will help

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.660
us to evaluate the ROI of different

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.940
campaigns, etc.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520
These cost models are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.620
as follows.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.880
We will explain this from the perspective

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.620
of the funnel.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.760
We start with the CPM.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.440
The CPM is the cost per thousand

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.560
impressions and one print is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.720
each time you appear.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.780
If you hire a banner in a medium,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.440
for example in an online newspaper,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.260
you will pay the CPM that determines

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.200
$5 for saying something, for

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.080
every thousand times you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.820
appear, regardless of whether

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.180
those people you appeared

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.700
to have interacted with your

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.080
ad or even seen it, but

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.200
it has appeared.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.960
The CPC is pay per click.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.800
In this case, what we will do is

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.520
every time a person clicks on

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.820
that ad and we take him to our

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.360
website or take him where we want,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.840
but the case is that the criterion

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.080
is that he clicks.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.540
We will pay the cost per

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.060
click.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.160
If you are told the cost per click

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.600
is 10 euros, because each person

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
who clicks on you costs 10 euros.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.360
Another option is the cost per lead.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.940
In this case, we have to

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.260
determine what is the criterion

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.460
for someone to be a lead.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.980
For example, we have a form.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.200
A form in which we ask you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.280
for your name and email account.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.220
Every time someone fills in

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.740
their name and email and sends

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.820
it, it's a lead.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.460
We would be paying for the person

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.160
who fills out that form.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.190
Other options, the most variable, the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.470
most aligned with your results

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.510
is to pay depending on the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.470
CPA or CAC.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.430
But sometimes it is used indistinguishably

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.410
and I will explain

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.230
the two.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.570
CPA is the cost per purchase.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.390
In this case, we will pay that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.610
amount, the CPA that we

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.430
determine, each time a purchase is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.130
generated that generates a transaction.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.490
The CAC is the cost of

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.510
customer acquisition.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.750
This is the same, but we will

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690
pay each time a new customer

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.270
is acquired.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.030
What is the difference between the two?

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.590
The CPA can be associated each

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.730
time an additional transaction,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.250
an additional sale, is generated.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.290
And CACs are sometimes not used indistinguishably,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.770
sometimes they are confused,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.570
etc.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.010
I want you to understand the difference.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.490
If we have an e-commerce and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.410
we want to calculate how much

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.750
it costs us each time we sell

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.030
an additional product, we

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.070
will use the CPA.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.510
And if we have, I know, an application,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.690
for example a software and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.870
what we want is to calculate how

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.670
much it costs us to capture an additional

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.090
customer, in this case we will

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.370
use the CAC.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.150
We have seen the different

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.850
cost models.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.270
What do you have to understand here?

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.770
As we go down, the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.630
risk decreases.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.250
Why is it?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.510
If you pay for CPM, you pay for

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.530
1000 impressions.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.570
But you take the risk that

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.390
those impressions actually

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.770
end up becoming visits, visits

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.170
end up becoming leads

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.870
or purchases, etc.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.290
You are taking the risk of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.670
all conversion ratios.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.310
It is then more difficult to estimate

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.250
what the cost is.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.570
You get 5 CPM.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.870
It is more difficult to assess whether that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.390
is profitable or not at the end.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.130
I go to the extreme.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.730
It costs 800 euros per purchase.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.490
Well, you already know that every

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.990
time you generate a new sale it will

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.270
cost you 800 euros.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.550
If your average ticket is 3000,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.930
you will win that margin.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.850
As you can see, the different cost

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.850
models must be analyzed according

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.650
to them, not only the cost itself,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.070
but the risk.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.650
Because if we go down, the CPA,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.150
the cost of customer acquisition,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.210
etc., are more aligned with

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.430
our goals and then the risk

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.370
is lower.
