00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.300
The world of platforms is much

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.900
wider than you think and what I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.300
thought and the point is that there

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.480
are many different types

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.720
of platforms.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.660
When we think of platforms, in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.720
addition, we always put the same

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.940
examples, because we put in

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.600
the typical or most well-known

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.680
marketplaces, such as Airbnb or

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.300
how it can be Amazon or eBay

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.600
or so, but there are really

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.360
many different business models

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600
that share or that meet the criteria

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.940
of being a platform, that if

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.200
you remember mainly is that there

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.360
are two customer segments that

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.700
generate value to each other,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.440
that a network effect is

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.280
produced, because as there

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.420
are more users, the value

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.100
for all is growing and there

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.700
are barriers to entry as a result.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.420
Well, there are many platform classifications

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.440
and we can classify the platforms

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.900
according to different criteria,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.160
because if they are between individuals,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.980
with individuals and companies,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.340
or the type of services that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.780
are or products that are exchanging

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.480
or the sector in which

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
they are present, well, infinity,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.320
but I think that it

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.360
does not contribute

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
too much.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.880
What we have to do is start

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.720
to be more analytical and as we

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.160
go knowing new platforms, concrete

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.680
cases of specific companies,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.920
well, because we go analyzing

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.660
how they connect their users,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.080
how they create value, how they

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.060
make money, etc., and what

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.540
we will do today is, we will

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.380
see in four blocks, marketplaces,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.560
classified, social

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.980
networks, content platforms,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.800
well, we will see several examples

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.040
that we all know and what

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560
we will do we will analyze

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.800
the examples, more

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.220
than the groups.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.140
Then, we start with the marketplace,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.500
a marketplace is a platform that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.200
connects supply and demand, because

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.120
we think of Amazon, for example,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.740
products, products are sold

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.780
through Amazon, in Airbnb

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.100
services are exchanged, accommodation

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.120
services, in booking,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.300
hotels hosting services, in Kickstart

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600
are very different services,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.880
by the way, if you do

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.640
not know Kickstart I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.920
recommend you enter because

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.280
it is very interesting.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.220
Well, the question is that, the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.240
particular is that it connects

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.200
supply and demand for products and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.410
services but that can be very diverse,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.080
right?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.520
Jovan Talent, for example,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.100
is temporary work.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.220
As we were saying, supply and demand,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.560
products and services diverse,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.260
between individuals and companies,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.820
because it can be C2C, B2B, B2C,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.240
well, of everything and something

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.340
to consider is that in these

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.020
we have seen, we are already

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.800
doing some analysis, all transactions,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.120
the operations are generated

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.500
within the application or within

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.800
the platform, the website,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.460
right?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.560
Inside, that is, you pay inside, you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.940
on booking, let's say you book and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.140
pay at that time.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.560
In Jovan Talent too, then

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.340
hire and pay.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
Airbnb and so on.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.740
This is an advantage for the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.440
platform because it allows you

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.480
to charge per transaction,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.940
a percentage of the volume traded

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.700
is taken, right?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.920
Another issue to bear in mind, which

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.940
is not so obvious, is that in these

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.360
marketplaces, the offer sets the price.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.280
That is, if you sell on Amazon,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800
you put your products at the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.640
price you want.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.400
This is not the case

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.760
on other autotype platforms,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.660
as we will see later.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.760
And now we'll look at a similar

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.620
model, but that has some differences

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.380
that are the classified ones.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.020
Let us give examples, which is the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.800
best way to understand.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.000
Idealist is an immovable

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
portal that connects the supply

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.820
and demand of housing, right?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.620
Infojobs is equal to or Monster in

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.400
the United States, supply and demand,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.360
but in this case employment.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.580
So what is the main difference

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.420
from the marketplaces

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.400
we've seen earlier?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.780
In this case, transactions

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.340
are generated outside.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.740
In other words, a home is not bought by an

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.480
idealist.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160
You connect supply and demand,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.160
but then the operation closes

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.700
out, right?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.860
In infojobs the same.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.080
So, this is what makes these

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.780
companies have to look for formulas

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.740
to monetize their different.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.060
They can't charge per transaction,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.080
as we've seen before.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.940
That I think would be to charge for

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.200
transactions the money, for example.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.820
Because idealist what happens is

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.320
that if you go up an idealist

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.240
house you do not have to pay,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.900
but if you go up more, if you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.980
go up several, yes, because you

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.460
consider you are a professional,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.740
an immovable agency, then

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.000
the professionals do pay within

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.660
idealist.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.720
It could be considered a freemium

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.520
service, because you have free

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.260
services, but the other values

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.980
you have to pay.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.060
And also idealist, like

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.160
so many others, because there

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.520
is advertising inside the page,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.920
so it wins its audience.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.720
Vivo is a portal of supply and

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.760
demand of second-hand products,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.180
because very similar too, because

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.360
if you are a professional you

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.700
have to pay and also use,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.260
monetize all traffic with ads.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.640
Wallapop is very similar.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.300
What happens is that Wallapop offers

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.780
a service to the user, a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.380
freemium service.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.160
You can pay to highlight your ads.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.360
Well, it's a particularity, but

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.620
let's, that in the end if you

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.320
realize, advertising formulas are

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.500
quite common or quite common

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.640
in all of the ones we've seen.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.540
If you can't charge on transactions

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.720
you have to charge in another way,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.340
such as offering premium services

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.400
or monetizing it via advertising,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.900
for example.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.640
We go to platforms that have

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640
a very different function and

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.200
are sometimes called marketplaces,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.460
but they are not.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.060
It is the platform on demand.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.480
And look, so that you understand,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.380
Uber, Cabify or for example or platforms

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.740
of this type that offer

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.920
you home cleaning services or

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.460
laundry and laundry, for example.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.300
Well, the important thing here is

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.240
that the app or platform offers

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.580
you an end-to-end service, offers

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.740
you a full service.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.700
All services are provided in the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.260
Uber or Cabify environment.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.720
You ask for the car, the driver

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.900
comes, etc. and even the marketplace

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.700
where the offer freely

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.760
sets it.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.360
In this case, the application is determined.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.220
And one topic that is a little more

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.460
complex to understand, but that is important,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.260
is how it creates value.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.720
How does a marketplace create value?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.820
Well, then it creates value with the

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.880
network effect, which as there is more

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.920
supply and more demand, because it

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.360
creates more value for both, right?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.740
If you are a buyer, what you want

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.520
is to create a lot of

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.560
sellers, right?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.360
Not that there is variation.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.120
In the case of one of the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.040
on demand platforms, such as

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.160
Cabify, the value is availability.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.440
The value is not so much who the

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.060
sellers are, right?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.440
But if there is availability in

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.620
the service you are consuming, you

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.660
ask for a car and arrive quickly.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.120
It doesn't matter who the other person

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.840
is, right?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.520
It's all under the water of Cabify.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.940
Well, and in this case also on demand

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.260
platforms, obviously, as it is an

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.660
end to end service, charge per

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.280
transaction because you pay

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.580
within the application.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.660
How do social networks work?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.180
They are also platforms.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.480
Social networks, as you know, well,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.500
because they have millions and millions

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.840
of users, they need a lot of critical

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.280
mass and what they bring is the

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.340
value of being able to connect

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.600
with other people.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.260
How do they earn money?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.440
These are evolving,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.160
right?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.100
But they currently make money

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.960
because they are important

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.540
advertising platforms, of the most

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.940
powerful in the world, Facebook.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.960
Facebook Ads Generate Billions

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.360
of Dollars, Well?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.460
LinkedIn also offers premium

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.560
services.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.900
Also, some social networks offer

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.600
you the possibility, then, to

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.540
pay and benefit from services

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.540
of higher added value, right?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.940
LinkedIn has a lot

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.280
of premium services.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.480
There are other platforms, which

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.540
there are people who also call them

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.060
social networks, but they are

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.320
not, that are content-centered, like

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.400
YouTube, for example, or like TripAdvisor.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.840
On TripAdvisor, content is the

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.780
millions of ratings that you've

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.840
rolled, that people's up,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.260
right?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.720
So what happens on a content

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.780
platform compared to

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.940
a social network?

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.040
That in a social network people

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.460
interact with each other, between

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.200
users and on a content platform

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.940
you interact with the content

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.020
that others have created.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.340
Do not interact directly with

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.240
other people.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.800
You can do it, but it's not the

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.880
main function, right?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.920
So, some upload videos to

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.420
YouTube, for example, and others

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.180
consume them.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.080
So here the value is, it is generated,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.860
the network effect that is generated

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.380
is due to the huge volume of content,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.760
to the millions and millions

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.920
and millions of videos that are

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.560
inside, right?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.880
How do they earn money?

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.560
Well, they make money because

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.500
they are also a advertising

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.640
platform, YouTube, for example,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.340
and in some cases, they also

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.980
offer premium services.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.700
YouTube, if you want to upload

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.340
a certain number of videos,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.400
well, you can, then, you can pay

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.960
an additional fee, an additional

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.000
subscription.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.000
Well, as you have seen, and as I advanced

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.340
you at the beginning of the class,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.280
the world of platforms is

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.440
huge, there are very many

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.060
types of platforms, and in addition

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.200
it is that if we do a categorization,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.180
yet, within each group, the possibilities,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.280
or the, there are many,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.500
a lot of diversity, right?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.520
I think what we should do from

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.240
now on is always that you use an application,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.880
or that you are on a web page, or

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.800
you start to ask yourself daily,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.660
when you interact with the company,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.220
how you make money, what is your

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.300
business model, etc., because

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.340
it is a continuous learning,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.280
very enriching, that will help

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.460
you understand many things,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.700
will help you understand companies

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.020
that we all use on a daily

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.300
basis and that many times,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.340
and that until now you

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.240
probably have not asked

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.180
you how it works.
