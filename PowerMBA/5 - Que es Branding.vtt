WEBVTT

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.060
Thank you very much for being here.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.820
Thanks to you.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840
It is a pleasure.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.580
In The Power MBA and within marketing

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.880
we have drawn a process, which

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.780
does not have to be the definitive

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.900
process, but that helps a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.280
little to visualize it.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.220
And we started by a segmentation,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.680
by a targeting, we started

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.060
by analyzing how our customer

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.000
is with a series of tools,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.260
such as the customer person,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.800
such as the map of empathy, and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.740
subsequently, once we know

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.440
our customer well, we reach

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.520
the positioning or branding

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.560
phase.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.420
And then comes the most tactical

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.600
part that is the marketing mix.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.780
We always say that creating

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.280
a powerful brand is absolutely

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.180
vital in any business.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.840
But you, as a branding expert,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.660
would love to help Power

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.340
MBA students understand.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.500
I will ask you a few simple

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.560
questions.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.180
What is Branding?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.280
What is not?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200
What is it useful for?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.460
Can you help us visualize what the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.560
impact of managing it well is?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.380
And put examples of companies you

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.300
have helped and what benefits

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.700
they have obtained by really taking

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.780
care of this.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.140
Where do we start?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.540
Why is it branding?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.800
See, branding, whether you search it

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.680
on Wikipedia or look for some

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.540
description, will more or less

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.000
explain what the discipline is responsible

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
for creating and managing brands.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.340
I immediately say, and what is a brand?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.140
A brand, depending on who you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.200
ask, will tell you one definition

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.240
or another.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.340
In principle again, if you search, they

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.360
will tell you, hear, because it is the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.880
set of elements, of distinctive

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.380
signs that allow you to identify

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.840
and differentiate a project,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.260
whatever it is, from another.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.320
In fact, branding began in the United

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.200
States, where they had different

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.080
animals, cows, etc., they had

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.380
to differentiate them

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.920
from each other, then they began

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.140
to point them out with a distinctive

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020
sign to differentiate them

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.380
that they were of one and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.300
another.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.600
This is where branding comes.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
But if you want that, it's, in some

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.580
way, the narrow vision or the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.240
vision, so to speak, small of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.020
branding.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.280
You have used a word

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.120
that is signs.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.780
Of course, if people think branding

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.440
is signs, it's actually a short-

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.660
sighted view, because branding

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.760
is much more than that.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.100
exactly to.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.340
Let's see what the brand is.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.100
Well, because a brand is more than

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.060
a name, a typography, a color,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.120
a logo, it's more.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.560
And therefore, branding is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.400
also more, as you create and manage.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.480
For me, and I say for me, a brand

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.740
is a promise.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.500
Behind that promise is an idea.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.320
So what is the idea?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.480
Why are you here?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.720
Who are you?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.940
What is your DNA?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.100
What is your competitive difference?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.460
What is your personality?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.580
What are your values?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.560
What is it that matters to you?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.720
That is all the brand.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.700
And once you have it all clear,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.660
you can manage, you can create,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.240
you can make branding.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.540
So for me, from my point of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.140
view, branding is at the top

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.000
of, if you want, the spit

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.340
of the pyramid of managing

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.680
business projects.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.940
As with this conception, understanding

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.260
the brand as that promise,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.440
the brand is in the very

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.640
genesis of the idea.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.480
I mean, I want to do something.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.320
I am an entrepreneur, I want

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.960
to do something.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.760
And that what do you want to do?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.220
Do you have a chance to do so?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.520
Does the market allow you to do so?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.480
Have you done a competition

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.540
analysis to see if there is a gap?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.800
Have you done a customer analysis?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.180
Have you asked customers to see

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.360
what they think about that proposal

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.080
that, in principle, has to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.880
be different and relevant?

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.920
What are your values?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.820
You do not sell products.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.100
The customer does not mark.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.280
Buying promises.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.260
What is your promise?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.200
Now you've built a more or less aspirational

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.500
brand, but in the end what

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.800
you have is a promise.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.520
And so why will they choose you, why

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.940
will they choose you instead of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.820
another option?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.540
This is what we need to work on.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.260
And sometimes it is for

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.920
pure rational reasons, but usually

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.020
it is for pure emotional reasons or

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.160
a mixture of rational emotions.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.300
I think that depends on, that depends

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.780
a bit on the type of sector in which

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.700
you are competing, because if

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.220
we go to very commoditized sectors

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.000
in which the elasticity of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.620
demand is very high and is competing

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.840
in price, well, because there

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.780
are the rational factors

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.040
maybe weighing more, but there

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.620
is another type of more

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.180
differentiated sectors in which

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.840
the rational factors weigh much

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.500
less.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.300
And how you have been able, if you

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.100
have been able to create a powerful

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.080
brand, because it will make

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.300
absolutely the difference between

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.780
buying you or giving you your huge

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.000
experience in this, you could give

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.940
us examples of cases in which

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.380
you have participated or not,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.580
or companies we all know

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.020
of the benefits, of the impact.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.280
I would like all students to understand

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.620
the impact of creating a powerful

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620
brand.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.700
The most practical impact of creating

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.660
a powerful brand is that you can

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.180
sell it for a higher price, being

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.780
very, if you want, very direct

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.800
and cold in this sense.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.620
That, forgive me that you cut, I have

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.180
friends in the wine sector and that

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.240
is what you said, the cellars that sell

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.440
more expensive wines, is just what

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.160
they did, that is, it is not that

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.340
they have made better wines, etc.,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.340
not part of there, they have been

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.580
able to create a brand that allows

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.820
them to sell wines instead

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.440
of 15 euros to 35 euros.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.900
Exactly, and that is true

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.580
for aspirational brands in sectors

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.480
where comfort is always living

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.200
with the product.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.260
I've recently worked for a sector, on

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.060
fixing systems, what tacos

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.620
are, and when you analyze the sector

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.560
it turns out that the leading brand

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.620
is the most expensive brand, and a

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.080
tacos that will be inside the wall,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.320
that nobody will see, and why you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.100
choose the more expensive tacos

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.720
and not a tacos that is much cheaper.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.220
Why is the market leader the most

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.260
expensive brand?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.580
Because the brand has worked well,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.560
it has worked well with

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.620
certain rational, emotional

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.860
axes, because it is permanently

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.680
innovating, because it transfers

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.480
a security image by a series

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.720
of elements that makes you, in

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.360
the end, decide to buy that stick

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.240
that will be hidden for everyone

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.200
and that will be inside

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.940
the wall.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.700
The truth is a perfect example

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.120
to illustrate something that I may

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.260
have not explained well before,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.280
that is that even in the most

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.900
comfortable sectors, working

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.740
well the brand has a huge

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.680
impact.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.340
There are obviously sectors where it

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.840
is very very very complicated, but

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.060
in the end what is your promise?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.180
Why are you here?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.640
Why am I going to choose you?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.320
Sometimes it's like moving the

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.240
personal issue.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.300
At the end of the day, if you do the

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.580
exercise of personification of a project,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.560
be it a brand, be it a city, be it

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.620
a book, be it a television program,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.580
be it a company, be it an NGO,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.500
at the end of the day, all

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.480
are brands.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.420
So the one who establishes that

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.200
empathy with those values, with that

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200
personality, with that way of being,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.720
of doing, beyond the product,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.900
why is it that copying the products

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.020
how long will it take to copy

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.060
an absolutely equal or even

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.900
improved product?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.960
I always say, as you're going to

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.980
copy well, not copyright, well

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.460
because that's somehow what the

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.420
brand allows you, that is, you can

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.600
sell for a higher price a product,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.300
a service that in logical terms

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.840
could be equipped to one more economical,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.160
but your promise goes beyond,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.480
you pick up a whisky and pick

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.380
up another whisky and do the

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.940
taste test and one is premium

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.860
and again less premium.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.140
The experience for even someone

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.580
who knows is probably slightly better

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.060
and can identify the most

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.720
premium whisky, but when you put

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.380
the brand you are moving a imaginary

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.880
world, an aspirational world

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.500
and the experience is remarkably

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500
better, really is remarkably better,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.140
because it goes beyond the taste

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.740
and therefore that brand that

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.300
is premium, that is exclusive,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.400
that is moving you at a particular

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.420
moment, is allowing you to

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.400
have a fantastic evidence,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.380
at the end of that contact

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.020
with the brand you are having

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.200
a unique experience, this

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.720
is what we when we create

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.320
brands.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.600
I would say beyond too, well and are

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.360
things that you have commented and

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360
is that the creation of a strong

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.880
brand, the product is copying, well

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.740
there are times that you can

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.460
have some competitive advantage,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.360
but well that is more copying and

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.780
the brand is a lot and the brand

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.040
is not copying, then the brand in

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.840
some cases what you generate

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.560
is a huge barrier entry or a competitive

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.760
advantage of such size that it

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.680
is a barrier entry for others

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.440
and if we think of the most famous

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.920
brands in the world, that yes,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.760
they are brands that are worth

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.420
tens of billions and that are a

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.900
real barrier entry and in addition

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.920
when you are able to create

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.540
a very powerful brand, you are

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.760
giving a sustainability to your

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040
business is that a little

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.200
independent of the products

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.800
you are going to sell and also

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.340
under the umbrella of that

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.620
brand, in many cases it allows

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.780
you to make a product

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.180
development that is

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.300
almost always
