00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.620
Sara, let's go with another

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.120
fashion word, very

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.600
broadly, which is leadership.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.260
What characteristics

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.400
or style should a good

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.180
leader possess?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.160
Well, because I carry...

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.780
This is one of my favorite topics.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.420
And I've stopped reading books and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.680
now I'm reading a lot of articles,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.180
a lot of Harvard studies,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.740
etc., and I'm capturing the...

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.820
This is a key element in

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.280
all new leadership philosophies.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.140
And so many studies have already

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
been done on what an effective, productive,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.420
successful leader has today.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.100
And he is a leader who is service-

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.300
oriented, serving his business,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.800
his team, and purpose.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.140
It can be a business,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.320
it can be an NGO, it

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.120
can be anything.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.100
A good leader, a good leader.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
It will be a very delicate balance,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.780
because what I am going to say...

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.140
It seems to be against these characteristics.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.780
Humility, authenticity and then

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.700
power of quick decision making,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.080
so action-oriented.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.490
At some point you have to change

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.790
what is preempting.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.090
If you are in run, run, run

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.710
mode, but you also have to recognize

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.930
when you have to take care

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.150
of.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.630
That is, recognize that you do not have

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.310
all the answers, that you are looking

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.590
for solutions in your team, in your

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.770
staff, that you will do it with them,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.450
that you will not send it, that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.670
you will participate and collaborate

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.190
with them and always be authentic.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.950
Show your human side, communicate

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.310
a lot more.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.050
So what they are looking for,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.530
especially the millennia that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.550
will make up 75% of our

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.690
companies by 2025, what they

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.830
expect is a conversation.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.950
Mandates from a tower or a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.170
corner office, what they

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.590
are looking for is more

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.810
collaboration with their committee.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.250


00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.950
The leaders who are running the business.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.310
Three concepts, humility,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.390
authenticity and quick decision making.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.790
I would encourage all our students

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.330
who are lucky enough to manage

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.090
teams to do an exercise of

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.670
self-reflection or diagnosis

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.910
of whether their leadership

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.250
style is service-oriented,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.370
as you said, and based

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.170
on humility, as you said, transparency

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.550
and ability to execute

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.630
and act.
