00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
The first case that we are going to analyze in detail is the case of the circus of the sun.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
The circus of the sun is one of the examples, perhaps the most common example that is always used with the strategy of blue light.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
It is a case that is also analyzed in the book and it is a case that helps to illustrate very well the use of all the methodology,

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
we have already seen the value curve, we already know what the concept of innovation in value is, the matirrice.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, let's put it into practice to see what the circus of the sun did to create its blue ocean.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
So Carlos, if you tell us, start by telling us what the circus industry was like in the 80s, which is when all this was born,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
and how they put the methodology into practice.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, if you like, we start a little bit as you say with the background, the circus market in the 80s of the last century

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
was a tremendously competitive market, in which there was less and less business and also,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
it was increasingly less profitable, it was tremendously expensive to operate,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
because there were many animals, many professionals, a lot of transport, a lot of logistics.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
In addition, there was a strong environmental pressure on the rights of animals,

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
a regulation that prevented the use and use of animals in urban areas.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
But I would say that perhaps the most problematic thing in the 80s was that its clients, the children, passed the circle.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And of course, being in an activity sector in which your clients turn their backs on you,

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
is possibly the most complicated thing for your possibilities to grow.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Anyway, Carlos, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I think the circus industry at that time was bigger than it is now, right?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
It was bigger, but it was very fragmented.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
There were, as we will see, large, small circuses.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, I would say that it was more popularized.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
I remember when I was little that circus figures, which I think no longer exist, were more popularized.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
It has worked, thanks to new technologies, thanks to the type of leisure we all practice in general.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
But in the 80s, this is when we started to see all this that we are discussing.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Let's do one thing, let's draw the value curves.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Let's start with the competitive factors or the variables of the circus industry.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
What would they be?

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
Well, as we can see in the image, the variables of the circus industry were beyond the price, which is generally present in all the circus.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Perhaps the most relevant ones are whether there are many or few animals.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
It was a show very based on the use of animals.

03:03.000 --> 03:15.000
If there were stars, like lion keepers or great acrobats, possibly very high cost in terms of their payroll and so on.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
If there was a lot of risk, if there was a lot or little fun, those were, as you can see in the image, the key variables.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
And we see the situation at that time.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
What existed?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Well, there were large circuses, which we see here in a red curve, national circuses.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000
Then there were smaller regional circuses that went through the towns, which, as we see in the image, had a value proposal somewhat lower in all its variables.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Okay, perfect.

03:41.000 --> 03:51.000
So, as you tell us, because many of our students surely have not experienced it, what they competed in was basically that.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
In addition to animals, to have recognized stars, who were famous people, who also made a lot of money.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
And it was a very spectacular show in terms of risk, also in terms of fun, clowns, etc.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
And also that the facilities were very complex, with many tracks or with several tracks.

04:15.000 --> 04:25.000
That's what I was saying. It had a lot of trams, a lot of logistics, many tracks, because we had to change the show while we were picking up the animals.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
We were riding the next act on another track.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It was something especially complex.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Complex and expensive. Perfect.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
That's it.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, in that context, the Cirque du Soleil appears.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Just in 1984, two Canadians create the Cirque du Soleil.

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
And they do it inspired by a methodology that illustrates very well what the Blue Ocean strategy is.

04:52.000 --> 05:03.000
I think the first thing these two people did was to realize, as I said, that the circus was not a show that attracted more and more children.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
They realized that they could therefore focus their value proposition towards other segments of customers.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
If we look at the image, the current customers of the circus in light gray were children.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
And the most common thing is to think, as was thought in terms of the Red Ocean, of the competition customers.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
This ellipse that we see in darker gray.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
But in the end, they are still more children.

05:28.000 --> 05:41.000
And the way to compete by stealing customers to the competition would be to lower the price or give more show, which in the end impacts a higher cost and therefore we are back in a price problem.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
What they did was to think of a completely new segment of customers, what we call in this strategy the non-customers.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
And what was the main non-customer segment that the circus had in the 80s?

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
As we see in the image, the adults, who are also the ones who have purchasing power to decide how to use their leisure.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I think it's really brilliant because the adults are always the ones who have paid.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But the price sensitivity is much lower in this case.

06:13.000 --> 06:24.000
Because the adult circus pays the adults and it is almost a competition of theater or something like that, much more expensive shows.

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
Instead, I imagine that at the circus you go with all your children and you go with more people, so you can pay less money.

06:34.000 --> 06:48.000
Thinking of the adults, what the circus proposed was a show, a playful and leisure activity, perfectly comparable to going to the theater or going out to dinner with friends.

06:49.000 --> 07:04.000
And thinking of them as part of this methodology, thinking of the adults, what it did was apply the RICE matrix of reducing, increasing, creating and eliminating variables, as has already been explained above.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
What did the Cirque du Soleil do? What did it reduce? Thinking, I insist, in a circus for adults.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
It reduced humor and risk. It is true that there is humor and risk in the Cirque du Soleil, but its show is not permanently based on these two factors.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Reducing humor and risk and suspense reduces costs without a doubt.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
Because it is not based on the triple deadly jump without a net, we greatly reduce the cost of professionals, insurance, etc.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
What did they do in the line of reducing costs?

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
They eliminated the stars, the renowned professionals in the circus.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
All the professionals are either amateur athletes or retired athletes.

07:50.000 --> 08:00.000
This greatly reduces the operating costs without reducing the value, thinking of the adults.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
They also eliminated the animals. The cost was enormous.

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
Acquiring animals, transporting them, keeping them, feeding them, veterinarians, brought enormous costs without bringing a great differentiation in value.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't know what the percentage will be in the total cost of the Cirque du Soleil circus with animals.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't know what it will be, but it has to be very high because buying them is the least.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Keeping them, transporting them, logistics, etc.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
If you take all that away, you obviously take away a very important part of your costs.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Indeed, eliminating variables in a proposal has a certain risk.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
In this case, they clearly eliminated it because, thinking of adults, the animals were not differentiated.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
They eliminated more things and simplified the operation of the circus.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
All that complication of slabs, cotton in the corridors, etc.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
The multiple tracks, as we mentioned before.

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
All that was eliminated so that the show is much more glamorous and happens on a central track.

09:12.000 --> 09:23.000
On the other hand, they thought of providing a value proposition for adults and increased this unique venue.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Not only is there a central track, but everything happens on a large carpet, unlike a traditional circus.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
They also increased the price, having reduced its costs, thus increasing its margins.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
They set a price in accordance with what we have discussed before.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
It is a leisure option, perfectly comparable to going out to dinner in a theater.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Therefore, they have set these prices, 50, 60, 70 euros.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
And finally, they created new variables, new proposals that provided more value, thinking of adults.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
A theme, a kind of argument, a leading thread, at least in the shows of the circus.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
A refined environment, which was lacking in the traditional circus.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
Multiple productions, thinking of the client's loyalty and recurrence.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
When the circus returns to society, we go back because the show is different.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
And finally, artistic music and dance, which in many cases is of its own production,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
other times it is of the Beatles or Michael Jackson.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Finally, as we see, a very different value proposition from what existed at that time.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
The truth is that it is truly brilliant.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I have a question about the march, Carlos, I don't know if you have an answer.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
The Cirque du Soleil was born from the circus industry?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I mean, were they people who came from the industry or not?

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
Yes, in fact, these two Canadians, Daniel Gautier and Gaela Liberté, were two circus personnel.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
A fireman, a trapeze player, I think I remember.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Look, even more merit.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
You are going to allow me to make a final summary because the truth is that it is a spectacular case.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Two professionals, as you say, who come from the circus industry, realize in the 80s

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
that the demand is falling, that children are increasingly less fond of the proposal of the circus.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
And then what they do is think of a circus for adults, which has more purchasing power.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And what they do is create a totally different proposal,

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
applying the concept of value innovation that we have learned in the Blue Ocean strategy.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
What they do is, to reduce costs, they simplify everything.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
They take away the animals, which leads to a reduction in cost.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
They simplify the whole structure of the tents, etc.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Because, as you said, there were many before and now they make a single tent.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
They also take away stars, well-known people.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
They reduce concepts like clowns, risk, etc.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
And with all this, they reduce the production costs of the show.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
But on the other hand, what they do is add, thinking of adults, other concepts.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
A theme, music, dance...

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
It is an environment that has been refined, that you can almost compete with the theater or concerts, for example.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
And of course, by incorporating all that, what it allows is to charge much more.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
I don't know if the tickets cost 75 euros or something like that, or more.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know, but in any case, I imagine that much more than in a traditional circus.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Therefore, thinking of non-clients, they have achieved value innovation.

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
They offer much more value to those non-clients, which are adults, and also to a lower cost for the company.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
Therefore, I understand that it is the case that they always put, because it illustrates perfectly the methodology and the benefits.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
And it is also an example of Océano Azul that has remained as Océano Azul and without competition practically throughout all these years, since 1984.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
And with a lot of success, with some period of financial difficulty.

13:03.000 --> 13:13.000
But in general, it has remained as a tremendously profitable Océano Azul and with a barrier of entry to competition that has made it continue today practically in its history.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
The truth is that it has everything.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, in the next class we will analyze other cases of the Océano Azul strategy.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Thank you.
