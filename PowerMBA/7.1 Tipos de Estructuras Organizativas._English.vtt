00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.620
The typical organizational

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.120
structures have always been three,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960
which are Functional, we are divided

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.080
by functions, Divisional, we

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.660
are structured into different divisions,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.180
Matricial, which is the combination

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.480
of the two previous, and

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.700
by Projects, which is the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.780
current trend.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.660
Let’s start with the functional organizations.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.040
In this case, what does it consist of?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.940
It is very simple, we can see it on screen.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.720
We will structure the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.060
organization according to, being redundant,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.320
the different functions

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.820
that are within a company,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.980
which is what you can understand

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.460
by Departments.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.780
Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.700
Systems, etc.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.360
What are the benefits of this?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.020
It has certain benefits.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.040
They are simpler structures.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.680
Usually small companies

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.120
are structured like this almost

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.980
naturally.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.700
What we is that many synergies

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.960
are generated, because you

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.000
can work with people who

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.320
have some knowledge, skills,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.220
very concrete experiences

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.960
and the same.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.460
Those in the Department of Finance, because

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.840
everyone knows about Finance and work

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.580
together and understand each other well.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.200
That said, the simplicity we’ve

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.620
seen, the synergies, etc., functional

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.200
organizations have a big

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.820
disadvantage.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.280
And it’s that you’re structuring

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.260
the organization in a way that’

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.860
s not aligned with strategic goals,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.940
because in the end you’re

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.080
creating departments.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.140
So we’ll think of Finance, Marketing,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.260
etc., which measure their

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.400
productivity, have the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.860
goals they don’t have to have

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.120
in mind the real or strategic

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.240
goals of the company.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.960
I will give you an example.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.560
Let’s think about the product department.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260


00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.800
The Product Department at the end of the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.320
year, because you will be measured by,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.020
imagine, because you will get X products

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.900
per year, etc.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.140
But it is very possible that they don’t

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.040
have the customer in mind, that they don’

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.640
t have the customer experience in mind.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.200
And that makes us sometimes use

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.940
the products you say, but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.780
what were you thinking about?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.180
Because they obviously forgot

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.280
about the client.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.220
And this is the result of that.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.840
It is the result of which the product

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.940
design did not take the customer into account.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.500
It is usually a result of a functional

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.180
structure.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.820
Another disadvantage is, which

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.540
is very related to this, that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.740
employees lose vision.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.640
Because what happens is that they

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.380
are alone, that is, they are in

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.760
their function, but lose sight

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.840
of strategic goals or how their

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.340
work affects or contributes

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.400
to the goals.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.600
This creates dismotivation.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.100
You become very expert, very functional.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.800
The third disadvantage is that communication

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.360
between departments is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.540
very poor.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.760
Because in the end, you think, finance

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.060
and marketing, well, because they are

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.500
different people, with different training,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.660
with different goals that are not

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.360
absolutely, they have no motivation

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.820
to understand each other, in

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.480
fact they do not usually understand

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.020
each other.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.920
And when one has to get into the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.520
work of the other, because you usually

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.400
see it as if you are touching

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.220
your nose, said in some way.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.520
Now let us look at the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.420
structures or divisional organizations.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.560
In this case, we are organized

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.880
according to different

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.640
divisions.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.100
Divisions can be by geographies,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.280
imagine that we structure

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.720
the entire organization according

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.200
to the different countries in

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.940
which we are.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
Or it’s a smaller lawyer’s office, imagine,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.380
and we have a headquarters in Madrid,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.800
another in Barcelona and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.860
another in Valencia and we

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.140
create divisions.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.240
For example, we can

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.500
create products.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.460
Imagine we have, that we are a

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.480
car manufacturer and we have

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.160
several models and we create

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.220
divisions by model.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.780
Or by brands, we have several

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.580
brands and each brand functions as

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.900
a division.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.800
You probably understand the concept.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.060
You also have to keep in mind that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.420
each division is almost like a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.420
small company, because it has

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.220
its goals, has its budget, etc.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.200
The advantage of this, of division

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.160
over functions, is that you

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.460
are structuring the company

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.820
in a way that is more aligned

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.340
with the company’s goals.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.820
You’re not creating those silos that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.900
people think only about their

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.480
function, their tasks, but lose

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.300
in perspective.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.300
The company is more aligned with

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.980
the goals.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.340
This is the great advantage of divisions.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.880
The disadvantage is that they can

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.220
generate inefficiencies and I will

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.260
explain it with an example.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040
We have divisions by countries, by countries

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.360
in Europe, imagine.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.060
We have France, we have Italy,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.520
we have the UK.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.920
Each one functions as a small

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.200
company that has its own goals,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.900
resources, budgets, etc.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.220
And its functional departments

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.100
also within each division.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.260
We have marketing in each

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.040
country.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.380
We have x marketing employees,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.160
who also work completely

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.240
independently.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.580
The marketplace in Spain has

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580
nothing to do with the marketplace

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.400
in the UK.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.960
Here, first, a doubling of costs

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.020
is being generated, because

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.880
you can have people who are doubling.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.800
But it’s not just a question

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.980
of cost duplicity, it’s a matter

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.240
of not generating a

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.260
joint learning.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.740
Imagine that within Spain a very

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.340
powerful initiative is being launched

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.740
that improves the customer experience.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.300


00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.580
It is not working for

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.700
Europe, it is working for

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.540
Europe.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.840
And it is very likely that then extrapolating

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.100
those initiatives to other countries

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.280
will take a long time, there will

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.040
be many barriers to overcome, etc.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.500
We can organize ourselves

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.660
by functions and by divisions.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.980
The matrix, the matrix organizations,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.700
what they do is a mixture

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.100
of the two.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.840
A matrix has two dimensions.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.900
We are going to be structured by

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.580
functions and by divisions.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.380
Every person will have two

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.900
bosses.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.600
You will report to your superior or your

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.460
functional boss.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.780
Imagine you work in the marketing

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.900
department, reporting

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.060
to the CMEO.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.200
But you also have a boss who

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.300
can be, imagine, the CEO in a particular

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.140
country or the manager

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.180
of a product.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.280
What are the benefits of this?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.480
Well, basically what we are trying

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.720
to do is combine the advantages

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.120
of the two types of organizations.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.600
We will that the organization

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.280
is oriented to the results of

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.440
the company because we are structuring

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.860
ourselves according to

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.380
products or business lines

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.980
or countries, etc.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.520
But we generate certain synergies

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.320
because we have cross-functions

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.740
and what they do is

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.840
serve everyone.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.100
I will give you an example.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.060
Remember, we talked about having

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.680
divisions in each of the countries.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.280


00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.920
We pick up and the marketing

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.600
department centralizes it.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.220
And we have a marketing department

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.740
for all of Europe that

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.140
serves all divisions

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.600
in different countries.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.400
Well, because it is easy to understand

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.920
that many synergies will be generated

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.020
like this, that we will avoid duplicities.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.080
Maybe we need fewer resources

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.380
and we can put them to

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.140
work on initiatives or support

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.340
all divisions, so the impact

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.120
will be much greater.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.720
One of the disadvantages of

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.040
matricials may be that the power

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.500
line is unclear.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.200
It is easier when you know you report

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.140
to a single boss than when you report

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.580
to two bosses.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.620
In some cases, there

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.720
can be tensions.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.060
But what is clear is that almost

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.480
all major organizations have

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.900
in recent years tended to be

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.080
structured by matrices.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.600
Therefore, it is obvious that the

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.140
benefits are greater than the disadvantages.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.020
And finally, let’s talk about the organization

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.640
by projects, which is a very

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.200
clear and unstoppable trend.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.160
That allows us to be more

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720
adaptive, to be more agile,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.860
to put in place many projects,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.460
to be more flexible.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.600
So what does this consist of?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.040
Regardless of your structure,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.680
whether functional, matricial,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.980
divisional, it doesn’t matter,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.760
what you do is create projects

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.440
that are temporary organizations

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.440
made up of people who can be in

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.240
different departments,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.580
even in different countries,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.240
that you put them to work with

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.680
a common mission, with a common

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.060
and temporary goal.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.160
One of the advantages of organizing yourself

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.880
by projects, in addition to being

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.520
more agile, is that you encourage

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.980
employee motivation.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.480
Because it is more motivating to work

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.020
with a specific mission for a specific

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.320
time period and know that you will

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.220
contribute to that and that it also

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.460
has a huge impact on the organization,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.780
that you take your whole life going

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.120
to your workplace and have

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.940
your tasks and you do not know

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.600
very well what the impact of what

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.580
you are doing is.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.760
It is clearly that people work more

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.900
motivated with temporary

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.300
missions and projects.
