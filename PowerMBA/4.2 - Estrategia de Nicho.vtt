00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.860
As we have seen, segmentation

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.480
strategy is an alternative,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.640
an option that makes sense

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640
in many circumstances.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.520
Especially when the big players

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.840
in a market that play differentiation,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.700
low cost, etc.,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.060
have left gaps.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.580
That is, there are opportunities

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.740
and it is really that many times

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.280
the logical alternative for smaller

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.440
companies than when they are born

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.760
are able to identify a small opportunity,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.360
a gap that the large competitors

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.340
have not covered, a gap as

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.680
far as dissatisfied customers,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.280
as far as some product

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.860
is to be developed, etc.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.000
There are challenges

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.860
in the segmentation strategy.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.380
Well, the first, it is obvious,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.380
is that the size of the market

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.940
has to be large enough.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460
You can't throw yourself into a niche

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.680
that results in the size being too

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.720
small and in the end it's that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.940
you don't have enough size, after

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.760
sitting in a niche, if you

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080
want to grow your company, if you

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.120
want to become a competitor,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120
well differentiation or low cost,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.560
start growing, well, for many times

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.640
you see yourself with that problem,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.900
because you have focused

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.060
too much, you have too

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.280
specific knowledge in a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.600
niche.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.520
Then there are threats.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.740
Threats are given from above

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.460
and from below, mainly from above,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.900
that is, here we see it

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.920
on screen.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.580
Competitors, the biggest competitors,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.160
well, leaders in cost, in differentiation,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.520
usually as soon as they

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.800
identify that there are

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.120
niches that are very profitable,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880
try to lower those niches,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.160
try to steal that market share

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.220
from the niche competitor and

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.620
I put you an example.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.420
We have seen several times

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.840
the comparison of Decathlon

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
with the bike store.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.720
Well, Decathlon, identifying

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.720
that there is a certain volume

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.060
of business, what it does is create

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520
specialized services within

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.960
Decathlon, hiring professional

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.700
specialized in bicycles,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.880
etc.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
This is clearly trying to compete

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.100
with its niche competitors,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.940
with specialized stores.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.600
Obviously it is still difficult

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.860
for Decathlon to acquire

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.760
that knowledge, that closeness

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.380
to customers and probably

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.760
cycling fans will tell you that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.880
the service is much better in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.900
a specialized store, but as

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.560
we see it is a threat.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100
We also talked about

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.540
craft beer.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.640
Well, it's because big brands

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.040
also try to create products

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.560
that are very suited to compete

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.920
in those niches.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.980
For example, in the case

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.560
of Osborne, he creates a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.360
craft beer, relying on a manufacturer

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.040
of very high quality.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.460
Another example, imagine that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.180
you are a small office and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.840
the big, the big four, the big

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.880
offices, etc., one day decide

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.120
that they want to expand

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720
their range of services

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.980
and compete with you.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.760
This is a threat, of course, that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.540
in many cases will steal you customers.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.300
But the threats not only come from

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300
above, that is, from competitors

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.240
who are directed to the entire market

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.400
and who try as soon as they identify

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.800
that there are niches that are being

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.500
left to cover, they try to steal

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.780
you, but also sometimes come

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.160
from below, they come from a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.100
strategy like the one you have

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.820
followed.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.540
They come from a larger segmentation,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.440
from a larger niche.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.580
I will give you an example.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.720
An e-commerce that decides

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.920
to focus on a niche that is

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.600
babies, right?

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.540
It has a clear

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.460
niche strategy.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.340
What he does is, instead of selling

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.740
all kinds of products, babies

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.040
are concentrated, they know mothers

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.060
very well, they know the products

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.320
very well, etc., right?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.200
But it turns out that they are

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.060
a competitor Good, because they are

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.720
competitors because there is

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000
another competitor who is

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.340
still more specialized and sells only,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.120
for example, a pan subscription

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.340
service.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.680
It is a clear threat that has

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.400
arisen from a competitor that has

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.100
taken the segmentation or niche

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.680
strategy to a greater extreme.
