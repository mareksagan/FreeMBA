00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.120
There are certain keys that allow

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.800
us to seek competitive differentiation,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.900
which is ultimately the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.520
axis of brand positioning.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.960
At the end of the day you compete

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.980
against others and what you have

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.860
to have is the ability to have a hole

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.260
in the mind, which is where battles

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.300
are fought, in the mind of

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.660
that client you want to convince,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.460
who there are ways to that differentiation.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.780
One is, being the first, we

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.720
love the second, the third,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.280
those who fight the leader, but in

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.360
the end the majority say, well

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.420
I the leader, because the leader

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.220
is sure that it is a good option.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.800
Are you talking about timing or are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.140
you talking about market share?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.920
Be the first to the idea.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.540
Kleenex was the example and left with

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.360
the generic.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.580
Bitter Cash was the first and left

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.480
with the generic.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.040
Then there will be others, but they

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.180
will have it much more complicated

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.440
because you were the first.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.500
If you are not the first, at

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.800
least the first in the new category,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.080
in a category that you invent

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.760
or that may make sense from

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.400
a market point of view.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960
The Power MBA is the first within

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.160
the category we have created.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.400
Exactly, it's an example, it's a

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.320
niche strategy in the end, that generates

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.960
a new category that's interesting,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.320
that's different and that's

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.160
relevant to a certain audience.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.260
Wolf did it with the GTI, created a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.720
category, but then Nissan came and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.320
said, well, it's not all invented,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.020
I'm going to invent the whole way.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.980
And it turns out that this new category,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.640
who is the market leader of that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.400
new category?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.920
Nissan, with its model that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.900
probably have looked similar.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.120
What you're telling me is very

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.360
interesting because it's not

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.960
so much, that is, we can think

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.040
this is too difficult, but it'

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.620
s not, because what you have

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.600
to think is, if I want to create

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.780
a powerful brand, why don't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.260
I think of a category?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.460
Why not try to create a category?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.660
That maybe it is a niche category

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.280
and we can not aspire to create

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.660
a blue ocean, which is a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.300
niche, but within that niche,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.040
your brand is considered

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.660
the leader in that category.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.500
That is.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.300
More possibilities, the one that has it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.460
all, the one that has the broadest range,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.720
and that allows you to do it one

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.720
brand by sector.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.420
It can be one of the IKEA of the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.160
category, it can be one of the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.600
Decathlon of the category.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.780
The range of gamma.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540
I am the one who has the most range, the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.000
one who has it all in some way.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.060
This is a way of being different.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.900
It is a different way to be different,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.800
at a price.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.660
I always say that low

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.740
price positioning doesn't make sense,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.780
that's not positioning,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.120
because there will always be someone

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.160
who can say that it's more economical

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.400
than you, there can always

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.980
be someone who is more efficient

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.500
than you, but instead

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.740
for high price you can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.040
say it.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.120
I don't know if you remember the most expensive

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.260
turret, it's one way to say, “Hey,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.440
I'm the most expensive in the world.”

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.160
This is somehow related

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.980
to quality.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.380
I was talking about

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.060
this at home because it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.460
seems absolutely brilliant.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.660
I have no idea if it is the most expensive,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.100
I have no idea if it is good,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.840
I don't know.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.600
I know that's all in

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.580
our heads and you position

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.100
it as a high quality

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.480
product.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.920
As for what you said about

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.160
low-price positioning, and this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.240
link to something we've learned

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.280
from Michael Porter's generic

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.560
strategies, is that there is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.720
no price leader, there is a

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.400
cost leader.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.300
That is, if you for your economy of

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.860
scale are IKEA and you manage to be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.500
the leader in cost, great, because

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.560
you will develop a competitive

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.960
advantage, you have a strength.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.240
But it's not a matter of positioning

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.100
yourself as the cheapest, because that'

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.940
s a nonsense.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.580
Well, it's not a nonsense, but

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.780
it's easily copied.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.880
Zara, for example, what is it?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.440
Zara is in some way a very effective

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.320
brand.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.320
It is a very good quality, price and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.680
design ratio.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.680
And obviously it is probably the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.020
most cost effective.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.180
Same as McDonald's.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.480
But it is not moving you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.040
a price brand positioning.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.660
None of the two brands are moving

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.340
you that.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.600
You are being moved by something

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.100
else, much more aspirational, much

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.660
more enriching, much more empathic,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.360
much richer.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.140
That doesn't mean you don't have the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.440
ability to innovate or that you don'

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.600
t have the ability to empathize

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.260
and to generate and adapt to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.540
customers, as has other brands.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.260
You have to work your position,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.080
your position.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.440
Another possible way is

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.700
the exclusive sale of English

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.980
crude, exclusive sale in pharmacies,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.400
exclusive sale...

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.840
The only one that is not selling is the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200
one that is not selling online.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.260
No, it's that one way to move

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.920
exclusivity right now is to

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.980
go to counter-current,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.900
isn't it?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.640
The counter current is usually a good

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.300
idea to look for the competitive difference.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.840
It is counter-current.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.740
Exclusivity, scarcity is clearly

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.720
something that is perceived from

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.480
the customer's point of view

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.820
as something of more value.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.380
The other way is the specialist, in

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.740
front of those brands that have

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.400
everything.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.860
I am, for example, on the panel.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.300
My brand works unique

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.040
and exclusively panel rackets.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.500
Who is the specialist?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.860
The one who sells sports shoes,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.540
the one who sells chandels, the one

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.940
who sells balls, the one who sells tennis

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.220
rackets, the one who sells panel

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.660
rackets, or the one who sells

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.700
only panel rackets?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.920
Who will you trust most?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.880
I remember an experience, I don't know

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.120
if you remember the case of Amena.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.040
Amena was very new, first of all

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.620
by name, because she bet on a color,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.940
clearly green, she bet on a much

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.520
more fresh type of communication,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.060
because she bet on a different

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.660
audience, which were the young

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.040
people in the end.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.960
And, of course, that big bet achieved

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.560
a market share, scratching market

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.500
quotas to those who then had it, which

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.920
was Movistar on the one hand and

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.240
Vodafone on the other.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.820
But, of course, when Amena wanted

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.340
to go to sell to the companies,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.980
it cost her a lot, of course

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.040
it cost her a lot, because she had

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.220
done a good practice

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.640
of brand positioning, had chosen

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.960
a segment and, of course, if you

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.160
go to the shopping manager and

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.140
say, man, the

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.680
brand my son uses will not be

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.500
the brand that will be good for

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.260
my company.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.080
Of course he sold in the world of

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.600
the company, but it cost them much

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.000
more, because they had found a hole,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.840
a niche of the market, a big bet

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.340
for a different communication, fresh,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.780
bet for a color, a different man,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.700
who found an empathy with a segment

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.160
that was not identified with

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.760
the brand that was of

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.180
their parents, nor the brand

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.860
that did not come to them in a

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.860
clear way, did not generate that

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.000
relationship, did not generate,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.380
did not that engagement,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.720
that link with them.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.540
I always say that whoever wants to be

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.960
everything in everyone's mind ends up

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.460
being nothing in the majority's mind.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.220
actually is.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.660
and perfect.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.900
I will give you a look at what you have

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.860
already told us to finish.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.100
You have given us a number of tips that

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.340
are really valuable and that allow

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.060
you to create a very powerful brand.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.080
If you can or try always, I would

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.180
say no, if you can, try always

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.260
to create a category and be the

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:53.940
first.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.500
Kleenex is an example.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.660
There is another way to differentiate,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.980
to create a powerful brand, is

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.520
to differentiate by the degree of amplitude.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.280
For I enter this market or compete

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.660
in all product ranges, which

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.060
also allows you to target more

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.040
increases of customers,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.440
of the catrone and what, etc.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.800
You can position yourself for high price,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.720
1880 I think is the most expensive turrone

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.420
in the world.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.020
and correct.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.800
You can seek exclusivity, scarcity,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.940
and so on.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.180
You said another that is, you can go

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.140
to counter-current and we have

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.320
not made it a lot, but if you do

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.500
things, if you do everything different

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.540
from the others, we have checked

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.980
it on some occasions, it will

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.960
allow you to create a powerful brand.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.340
Different from others, at least

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.800
it will allow you to differentiate.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.800
Almost as a value in the company, I'

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.220
ll do it differently but all differently

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.520
from my competitors.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.100
If they use the distribution

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.000
channels, I will use others,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.600
if they communicate.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.680
And finally, you said one that is positioning

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.560
yourself as a brand specialist

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.500
in something, that we have linked

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.980
it with Michael Porter's focus,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.100
segmentation or niche

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.580
strategy.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.860
And if you can't, because your environment,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.320
your sector and your competitive

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.680
situation is tremendously complicated

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.120
and does not give you any of the alternatives,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.660
at least you have a very differentiated

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.180
communication.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.320
There are brands that differ

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.440
precisely for that, by a radically

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.860
different visual identity,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.540
by a radically different

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.180
packaging, by a provocative

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.100
communication.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.800
It is a way.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.420
You are moving your essence, your

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.460
personality, your values, in

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.260
some way, into the way you communicate.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.080
I will finish with an example, which

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.340
I will talk to him because I want

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.020
him to come and tell us soon.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.960
A Spanish businessman in China

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.080
identifies that in the lineals of

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.700
supermarkets, etc., the bottles of

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.700
wine are all indifferent,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.820
as it happens, it is very difficult

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.900
to differentiate.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.480
And it also identifies that

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.280
the West are aspirational there.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.920
He decides to create a brand with

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.600
his name, David Wine, he will

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.960
tell us, in which his face appears

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
on the bottles.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.760
That has brought him a success, a brutal

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.660
thing in a market, imagine yourself

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.520
like the Chinese.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.720
And it's just what you're saying, it'

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.440
s all the rest not, because you haven'

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.800
t created a brand, you haven'

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.100
t positioned yourself by price, etc.,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.560
and you can't use all of what you

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.660
said, you can't use them in that

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.740
particular case, but what you'

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.500
ve done is a communication

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.640
so different that it has allowed

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.020
you to create a very powerful brand.
