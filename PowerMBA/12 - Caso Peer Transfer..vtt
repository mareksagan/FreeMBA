00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
I was born in Boston, I was there for two months because of my parents' work circumstances.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
I ended up in Valencia, I studied there at the institute, at the university.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And from the university, well, let's say in parallel, I had a little agreement with my parents,

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
that is, while I get good grades, I can do a little of what I want, right?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
So, I did a lot of things during the university in parallel, right?

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
I studied industrial engineering, I did organization, business plan competitions, etc.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
I even had a music program, dance music, Saturday nights on the radio, things like that, right?

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
I went to Germany in the summer, I don't know, I thought I was going to work in a factory and I ended up organizing Latin parties,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I mean, very random things, right?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
And well, I started doing internships last year in an industrial company,

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
and then when I finished my degree, I started working at BCG as a strategic consultant,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
two years in Madrid and one in London, and from there I went to MIT.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I did a program called Leaders for Global Operations, LGO,

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
which is a program that originated in the 80s as a reaction to Japanese competition,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
by industrial partners who set it up together with MIT.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
And then, well, they pay you part of the enrollment and you do two masters,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
an MBA and a master in operations management.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
And there, well, I thought I would work again in some corporate, etc.,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
and well, I started to get a little bit of the worm of entrepreneurship and such,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and I started to go back to things that would have frustrated me, right?

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And that's a bit how I was born, how I was born, because it was my first adventure,

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
when, well, reflecting on my personal experience of paying the enrollment at MIT,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I was a scholarship holder for a foundation, Caja Madrid, and they made the payment,

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
so, of course, the university had a hard time getting that payment, which was for me,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
and then, in the end, I went up, I went down, trying to solve this,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
and at the same time, you realize that the bank has put a good nail in the exchange rate,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
in commissions and such, right?

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I said, how unfair the world is, in a way, that those who know less

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
and who can afford to be charged a lot of commissions and such,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
are the ones who end up paying the party, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
The small companies, the consumers and such.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
How much was the… to quantify it, to illustrate it well,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
what was the commission you were going to pay?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Not in percentages, in percentages it doesn't matter.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes, it was 1,000 euros, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So, in the end, in a payment of 40,000 dollars…

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
It was 1,000 euros.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You end up paying 1,000 dollars, in this case, yes, approximately,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
so it's 5%, so you say, wow, I didn't realize it and I just lost 1,000 dollars, right?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Because the kind of exchange rate the bank gives you is very different from what's on the market.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
And as you know, it's a reference that, when one thinks about value proposition, cost saving,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
it's very easy when everyone knows how much a coffee costs, right?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
More or less.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
If someone buys you, they pay you ten times more,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
and if I'm used to paying 1.5 euros for a coffee and someone pays me 15 euros,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm saying, hey, man, you're stealing from me, right?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
But with the kind of exchange rate and with many things that are traded,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
they are changing continuously.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
So I would say, hey, 1.45, is it a good kind of exchange rate, euro, dollar or not?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, I don't know, you'd have to look at it, right?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It's not something immediate.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
So, that's an advantage for not creating a transfer in the market, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
For consumers.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
So I said, hey, why not create an alternative to bank transfer?

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Why not do something that is not necessarily the bank making that currency conversion?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And that's how Peer Transfer was born.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And originally, even the name of Peer Transfer,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I saw it as a peer-to-peer network where you can make transfers.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Basically, I come from Spain to the United States, I'm sending money,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
other people are sending money from the United States to Spain,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
because we don't net and we cross those transactions,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
and we directly prevent money from moving internationally,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and it moves domestically.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So that was a bit of what I started with.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And I said, wow, how innovative, how disruptive, how about this, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
A peer-to-peer network in this.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
So, originally it was a platform, yes to yes, right?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Consumer to consumer.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Yes, well, it could be corporate too.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It could be more of a peer-to-peer where there are different participants

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
who in the end make transactions.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And so, that's how I set up the first experience.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
And I got to a point where I said, wow, this makes sense.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
In the end, you have the debate of,

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
we are in a world where we are always a bit there with our ears raised

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
to see if someone is estimating us.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So when you see an ad that says, I don't know what is cheaper, the best, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You say, well, let's see, is this true or not?

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
So sometimes when you set up a business, explaining why it is cheaper or why it is better,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
at least, allows an understanding to the other party, right?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
To say, okay, well, I don't know, you don't have a building,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
so you save money on having a building and therefore you give me something cheaper.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay, I understand, right?

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
But there is a bit of the complexity between, if I explain to you how I am adding complexity

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
in the management of the business, and if I don't explain it to you,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
it may be that you generate mistrust, right?

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
So there is a bit of a dilemma, because I got to a point where I realized that this was very good,

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
but as soon as you start to have scale and you start to get very good types of changes,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
in the end it is not relevant.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
It improves margins, but it is not fundamental to build a business.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So I made the decision of simplification.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
To say, hey, look, we can give you a much cheaper type of change because we don't have offices,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
and yes, you will get a lot, right?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
It is an online business, with more modern technologies, etc.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And then I started to help small businesses and consumers.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
This was a bit of everything that happened in the last year of the MBA,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and I started to help small businesses and such.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And then, talking to the universities, I almost said, hey, look, please,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
you could tell some of these students who use us and such.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
And I was very struck by one thing, and this is the issue of this.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Sometimes the flexibility of adapting your business model, depending on what you learn,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
at the same time as the tenacity, right?

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
So sometimes it is not obsessing with what, no, this is going to be like this, yes or yes, right?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It has to be flexible and say, and depending on what is happening to you, adapt, right?

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
That discourse, product, proposal, etc., right?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Especially in that initial phase of validation.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And it is that the universities told me, if this transfer thing,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I don't understand what the hell.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
Because half of our students are from Asia, for example, from China.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
And many of them are called Li or Wang or very similar names, right?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
So of course, we see transfers and we say, and this one, who does it belong to?

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
And sometimes, many times, it is not even the student, it is the father or the grandfather who makes the payment.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Or an uncle.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And of course, this thing that is so silly, right?

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Like when you look at the extract of the card and say, what is this payment for?

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And you say, no, if you don't multiply this by 5,000 students, the chaos is absolute, right?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And then, I say, no, if we can't solve this, it will be interesting.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
So what I was almost saying, hey, please, could you tell your students to use us to send money?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It turned into, damn, if we turn the business around,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
and almost what we do is make your life easier,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
and thanks to you we are going to reach all the students who have to make payments.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
So here we get two things.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
One is confidence.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I mean, I don't have to convince a student.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
If it is not UNESCA, who is almost saying to the student to pay through the platform,

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
and then you reduce the cost of acquisition in a great way, right?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Because suddenly you acquire 5,000 instead of 1,000, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
So in the end, I think that...

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
So you switch from an open platform, as you said, to a payment medium that connects institutions.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
For example, the one that receives the payment, which is the university.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It is a B2B2C, where we sell to UNESCA.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
And that channel, channel bar customer, brings us to the customer, really, our end, right?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
In a way where both were bad.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
So it is a bit at the level...

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
But you rely on them, you rely on these institutions to capture many more customers.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Sure.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
So if you extrapolate it a bit, conceptually, it is,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
hey, maybe I am thinking of the end user client,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
but there are still ways to get there that are not direct, they are indirect.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And it does make sense if it reduces my cost of acquisition,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
it generates trust, etc.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
But that doesn't work...

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
It is like if PayPal, for example, grows in a new e-commerce portal that has millions of users,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
then at that moment it is capturing, it is gaining daily visibility in millions of users.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yes.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
And then, in the end, this makes sense when your channel also gains something, right? Ideally.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Because if it doesn't gain anything, in the end it will say,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
okay, how much do you pay me for this?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And then it becomes a little more expensive for you.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
That is the form of acquisition, if you think about acquisition of clients.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
But do you consider that, for example, in that case, the university is your channel or is it a client?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It is both.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Because we create a solution for them,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
a solution because it simplifies their life.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
So basically the model is that we give them all the information they need to process that payment.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
So the platform I created consisted of a use case.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
You are going to study in Spain, a university abroad.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
You arrive at that university and it says, hey, the enrollment is $30,000.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Then they would tell you, don't make us a $30,000 transfer.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Go to this thing, which, imagine, is the University of Borja.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Power MBA.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Power MBA or at that moment it was peertransfer.com, powermba.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And then I would tell you, where do you come from?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
No, I come from Spain.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And they would say, don't send us $40,000, send us $30,000.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So those euros you would send us to a domestic account.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
In a method of payment that you feel comfortable with.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Well, a domestic transfer, which in many banks is free.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Or a debit to your account.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And then we, taking those euros of yours,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
we added them with many other students who came.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
And then we made a conversion from euros to dollars at the majority level.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And with that we got a very, very good exchange rate.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And part of the savings we distributed with the student and part we gave ourselves.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
And then those dollars, along with many other dollars from Korea, China and so on,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
you send a payment of $10 million to the university

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
with the details of all the payments you needed.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
What is the savings for the user?

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
The user would be around 2 to 5% of the transaction volume.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That is, how much?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Today, the company...

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Would that be saved compared to doing it in the traditional way?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yes, in a bank.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Today, the company is saving around 50 million euros a year to students from all over the world.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
In commissions, in exchange rates, and so on.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
In total, you are saving that?

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Yes. Let's say, I led this company until 2013, when my first son was born.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I've been in the board for a year.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And then, to this day, I'm still an shareholder.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm not involved in administration management.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And now I'm returning to the origins of...

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Hey, educational payments are a common use case.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And I'm saying again, well, on this platform that we have created, what else can we do?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So when I came back...
