00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.280
Luis, we have analyzed the different

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.780
sources of funding that

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.180
startups use in The Power

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.000
MBA, but we were focusing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.860
on the application

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.520
of capital.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.820
We've talked about how to make a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.920
capital application with the Frames,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800
Fools and Family, with a venture

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.580
capital, with Business Angels,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.320
etc.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.880
But I would like you to tell us

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.940
that you have a slightly broader

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.500
perspective on what are the different

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.920
formulas and in some cases

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.940
from the point of view

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.720
also legal to which a startup

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.740
can resort to funding,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.280
to finance the growth

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.460
of investments.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.240
Yes of course.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.280
I think it is probably

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.500
a matter of culture.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.360
We have a culture in which we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.680
are accustomed directly when we are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.760
looking for a way to get more

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.780
resources to be able to devote

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.380
them to our business and

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.320
directly seek investors.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.240
This is due to lack of financial culture

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.880
or the assimilation of environments.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.020
But there are many ways in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.040
which they are interesting

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.240
again, always depending

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.540
on what level or time

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.360
your company is.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.820
For example, banking,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.500
which so denostated and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.120
so long.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.780
Now it may be a good option.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.160
In fact, there are already many banks

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.960
that are starting to generate

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.120
specific instruments only for

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.740
startups.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.060
It seems that banking,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480
it seems that startups do

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.860
not even ask.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.020
Yes, because traditionally a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.880
startup for its growth

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.160
moment, which are usually

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.040
very early moments.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.520
It is a regular and regular company

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.640
that is funded like everyone else.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.900
But initially it's always difficult

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.040
because your bank rating is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380
always very bad.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.480
Because you have few resources,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.040
you have a lot of expenses, you will

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.640
have losses for 1, 2, 3, 4 years.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.760
I would say that from the point

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.300
of view of the founders, if the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.260
risk is very high, fund with bank

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.660
financing projects that have

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.840
a very high risk, endorsed by

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.520
your personal wealth, because

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.280
of course, it is a formula

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.400
with an excessive risk for

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.080
the founder.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.900
And especially because there

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.980
is an uncertainty component that

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.700
is not in other.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.620
You have no idea what you will

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.820
need or how your company will

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.400
be in 2 or 3 years.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.560
However, I say, there are more and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.940
more banking entities that have

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.480
that sensitivity a little special

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.760
and have elements to evaluate

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.660
you as a company in a different

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.300
way.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.840
Even often without having personal

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080
guarantees or simply with the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.200
business guarantee.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.020
Of course, I thought it once, the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.900
banks are paving you on this or are

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.020
losing the participation in the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.260
companies that are growing most,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.260
which will grow more in the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.140
coming years.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.260
It is, it is so.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.880
In fact, many banks have already

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.640
installed not only vehicles

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.240
to invest, forgive me,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.660
to finance companies through

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.340
loans and policies, but

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.980
also have their own

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.220
instruments to directly

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.540
invest companies.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.700
It makes all sense, it makes

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.180
all sense.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.560
And I agree with you in the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.460
analysis that you are missing

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.700
out on a chance to make a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.860
lot more profitable money

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.260
than you would have with

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.220
a loan at 3%.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.740
The companies that are going to grow.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600
Well, then we have seen

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.300
bank financing, we have capital

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.640
expansions that is what we

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.220
have what we have learned

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.240
so far and that I will

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.400
later ask you to do us an

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.020
analysis of how the capital

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.200
expansion process really

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.640
works.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.900
Are there other formulas that

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.460
can be used?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.360
Yes, there are loans profiles that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.100
can be between individuals or also

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.420
with public or banking entities

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.160
such as participatory loans

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.260
or convertible loans, the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.680
mythical convertible notes

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.140
that we already know that come from

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.040
in the tournament of OaxacÃ³n,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.960
which have a specific regime

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.040
in those countries.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.500
For example, a convertible

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500
loan is a loan that is ultimately

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.680
a normal and consistent loan.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.900
The only thing you are linking

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.240
or allowing the person who contributes

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.880
that money in some way then

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
becomes a partner under

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.140
a specific condition.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.120
This is a very very very very practical

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.960
and very very good instrument

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.480
that we are increasingly seeing

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.300
in investment rounds.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.100
When they are bigger rounds, than

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.280
the typical very initial round,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.160
Friendful and Family, as you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.880
were before, or in the sit phase,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.120
in which you are somehow leaving

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
people who enter before with a discount

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.440
or with specific conditions in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.420
exchange for you to bring the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.760
money with a loan long before

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.180
the closing moment.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.960
Well, that is, we are in the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.180
process of a round that will

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.060
take a few months and let's say

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.080
that the notes or convertible

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.480
loans, as you said, is an instrument

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.660
that allows the first investors,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.280
who in this case are lenders

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.540
but end up being partners, to

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.760
enter at that prior moment

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.920
before they close the round

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.720
with a discount on the valuation

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.380
on the valuation in

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.420
which they close is exactly

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.580
that and always becomes

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.640
capital or not.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.760
That is the trick.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.960
There are a couple of tricks that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.920
are very important to consider, especially

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.900
from the perspective of the entrepreneur

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.880
or the person who is looking

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.800
for financing.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.960
The first is that there must be

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.780
a time limit and conditions

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.140
to convert.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.960
We have met many companies

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.340
that have...

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.740
I have a period of up to two years

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.340
in which the person who puts

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.620
the money to the lender, the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.260
lender, can decide whether

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.000
or not to convert.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.700
That in practice is killing you

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.520
any round of investment throughout

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.960
that period, because any

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.800
investor that comes later

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.240
first will dilute you.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.740
You don't know if it will

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.660
be a loan or a capital.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.840
I will put 50 million in your company

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.040
but I don't know if you're going to

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.420
spend it to repay a loan from a day

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.340
earlier or is someone who a clear

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.780
advice is that the convertible

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.680
note has to have first a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.920
period that is fixed, that

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.200
it's not too long and that then

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.160
it will be converted yes or

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.480
yes.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.600
Well, the advice is that the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.000
faculty to convert is tassed beforehand.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.600
That is, that I as an entrepreneur,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.720
as a person who receives that

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.000
funding, I have the ability

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.180
at certain times to say, hear, look,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.620
I give you 15 days to decide

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.880
whether to invest, whether it

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.980
is capital or not capital.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.840
Because otherwise, if it is a completely

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.860
open period and only depends

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.820
on the investor, you find yourself

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.520
generating uncertainty

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.600
to the rest of investors.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840
Exactly, it generates uncertainty to

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.020
the latter, even to the entrepreneur

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.120
himself who vetoes the possibility

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.380
of being able to continue

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.480
raising capital precisely for

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.660
that uncertainty.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.920
We have already talked about a

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.420
convertible loan or a convertible loan.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.820
and exact.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.220
The participatory loan, which

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.320
is a term that I think many people

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.420
hear, can you explain

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.280
how it works?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.580
Yes, I think that when we talk about

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.440
participatory loan everyone

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.800
has in their mind ENISA, which

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.380
is a fantastic entity that has

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.720
really helped a lot to the development

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.740
and growth of this

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.300
sector.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.060
It is true that the ratio of non-payments

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.860
from Spanish companies to ENISA,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.860
less than entrepreneurs and

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.400
startups, is unfortunately

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.240
quite high.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.200
Do you know him?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.020
I don't have the number, but we

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.160
have a lot of companies, a lot

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.780
of customers who also, because

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.860
of lack of culture or preparation,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.000
consider that a participatory

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.960
loan, which is true that the

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.180
conditions are legally very

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.640
good, is a subordinate

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.880
loan that has a number of conditions

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.320
that allow you to have

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.140
your own funds bigger in

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.300
the face of a...

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.320
That is what I would like to explain.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.600
What exactly or generally

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.060
consists of a participatory loan?

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.440
A participatory loan is

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.700
a loan, it is the one that

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.880
enters your company.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.300
What happens is that it has

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.440
a feature first that subordinate,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.540
it is the last one to pay, with

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.200
which in the face of your investors

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.240
is well to have that loan.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.560
And precisely for that reason,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.860
by that special legal regime, what

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.920
you do is that in case your

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.800
company is in the case

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.880
of dissolution, that is, that

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.940
your own funds are below half

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.960
of the social capital at

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.720
some point, this is counted

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.780
as part of your own funds.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.300
It makes them bigger, so it keeps

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.780
you away from the moment

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.920
of dissolution, right?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.520
So, with this small margin, it is

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.500
true that then, for example, if

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.060
you want to anticipate the repayment

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.920
of that loan, you have to make

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.560
a capital reduction.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.760
There are a number of additional

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.500
conditions, but to very large

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.600
features, which I would like

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.080
to be clear.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.020
The participatory loan, the most

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.780
interesting thing is that if you

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.600
are a company, you have a message

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.880
of spending that money, because otherwise

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.300
you do not ask, logically,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.760
it allows you, say, a little

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.140
more life, because it makes

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.360
your own funds a little bigger.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.780
It is not considered only as

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.820
debt, but is considered to be

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.200
part of it for the purposes

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.920
of dissolution.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.960
It is a kind of mixed figure,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.260
well, correct if I am wrong, mixed

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.400
figure between own funds

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.460
and foreign funds.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.980
and exact.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.240
And also, as I have understood,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.800
there is a participatory interest,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.780
that is, the lender can

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.760
participate with certain

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.260
formulas of profits,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.020
billing, etc., which is fixed

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.420
on the company's results.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:07.900


00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.840
It is a loan.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.860
Yes, but...

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.540
Did you take a loan?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.920
I mean, yes, I understand the concept,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.540
but let's say that in your balance sheet

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.220
it will be exactly the same as a loan

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.420
and you don't have dividends,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.520
you don't have dividend rights, you

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.580
don't have political rights.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.580
That is, in practice only is that

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.120
the subordinate character, the

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.300
fact that it is not as demanding

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.080
as the rest of loans, allows

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.140
you to form part of your

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.780
own funds.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.260
It is a figure that is

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.380
not interesting to the lender,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.580
to the person who grants

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.200
it to you.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.880
That is why the profile of people

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.080
who grant participatory loans

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.460
is usually people from public

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.320
entities, or some banks have also

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.060
done so, or venture capital

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.540
funds that are interested in

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.380
growth, and make participatory

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.680
loans convertible.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.040
Well, indeed yes is.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.500
Then there is another topic that

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.420
is not inherent to participatory

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.840
loan, but that in many cases, as in

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.240
the EISA has been given, and that is

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.140
very important to take into account

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.460
from the perspective of the founders,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.380
and is that in many occasions

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.460
the entities that grant the

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.820
participatory loan do not request

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.800
to VALES, that is, the guarantees

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.900
are smaller that they request,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.600
then that is very very favourable

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.780
for him, for the founders.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.240
Of course, as long as you can

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.780
get a funding where you don't

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.820
have to compromise your personal

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.000
wealth, it's always much

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.460
better.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.400
Especially when we deal with

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.680
these margin uncertainty

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.240
so big, you don't know where they'

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.360
re going to be in two or three

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.260
years, and you do this somehow

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.460
to drive the company to

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.900
early stages in which you

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.640
expect to get to a point,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.060
you already know what excels

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.040
are here for, for a little, unfortunately,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.260
or fortunately.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.060
To deceive you.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.540
Exactly, to fool you, or to

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.800
have a route sheet, then you

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.880
already know that it is not

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.180
met, as it is to update it

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.740
repeatedly, but it is true

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.880
that this is a tip that serves

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.220
for any form of funding.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.460
If the degree of uncertainty is

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.120
very large, you will try to play

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.080
your personal wealth, and then

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.420
there are mechanisms also via partnership,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.540
or through other instruments

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.720
to guarantee or maintain

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.720
some protection over your

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.520
wealth power.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.160
That is.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.000
Well, basically this is

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.080
what we are saying, the reason

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.160
why start-ups go, that is,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.260
the main financing

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.480
formula are capital expansions

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.780
mainly for this, because so

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.320
there is no obligation

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.420
to return it.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.780
and exact.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.840
So you're diluting, you're losing

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.420
part of your company, but

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.260
you're not compromising your wealth.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.060
Well, we have spoken about

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.920
bank financing, we have spoken

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.880
about capital expansion, we have

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.400
spoken about convertible

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.320
notes, participatory

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.340
loans, but I think there are

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.560
more formulas than new ones.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.060
Yes, first of all, a couple of

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.820
years ago the participatory investment

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.660
law was passed.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.760
In some way, they are instruments

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.860
such as crowdfunding, which

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.900
allow you, say, to open a lot

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.720
of the scope of the investment

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.740
profiles that can enter your

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.460
company.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.880
When you think of someone who invests,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.020
you are traditionally looking for

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.620
someone with some experience, with

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.700
a fortune that can invest 15,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.400
20, 30, 50,000 euros, it is a concept

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.720
of Business Angel that you have

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.600
already tried.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.120
However, there is a profile

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.880
of small investors who can equally

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.700
invest 1,000, 1,500 euros to identify

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.600
their small portfolio and

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.220
this people can access through

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.460
crowdfunding, which is well

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.180
developed in many countries.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.720


00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.120
How does crowdfunding work?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.000
Crowdfunding is a platform that,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.120
as we call it, participatory investment,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.540
where people can access, you propose

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.260
your project and you say,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.240
look, I want to get 150,000 of

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.640
1,000, 2 million of 2X, and

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.720
anyone can make small contributions

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.060
that by bringing them

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.400
together, say, you end up

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.640
having many more partners

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.720
in that case.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.180
They are all united like the Sauron

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.040
ring, they are all united through

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720
a hard partnership that allows to

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.320
trade unions, not with one entity,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.960
but through agreements to everyone

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960
so that they are aligned with

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960
each other and have at least

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.840
one representative.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.240
You imagine what it is to manage

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.520
a company, make calls, amendment

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.040
of partnership agreements with

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.340
200, 300 partners.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.540
The captive is mad.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.780
That is, an entrepreneur has a

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.960
project, he ups it up to a platform

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.300
like Startup Explore, for example,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.260
and there are thousands of

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.640
people who are investors within

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.960
Startup Explore, who can be

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.740
small investors.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240
Then a small ticket is set, I imagine,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.560
1,000 euros, 2,000, I don't know,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.060
whatever, and a round is closed

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.280
or part of a round is financed

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.300
with the contributions

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.420
of those people and they enter

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.300
the society through an extension

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:12.980
of capital.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.380
and exact.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.280
This, initially, models like,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.300
for example, the Startup Explore

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.180
when it was set up at first,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.260
seem to me much more interesting.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.980


00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.860
What happens is that the law vetoed

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.340
this, that it was the investment

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.200
through what is called a SPV, a

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.180
Special Purpose Vehicle, a special

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.420
or special purpose investment

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.720
vehicle, that we only

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.260
assembled this company to be

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.500
the sole partner of this

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.020
other company.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.520
Well, and that's what works in other

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.160
countries, right?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.520
of course.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.540
A company is created at that

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.380
time that is the one that enters

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.440
the Startup, the capital of

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.420
the Startup, and that society

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.100
is participated by all small investors.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.760
Exactly, then, say, act with

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.460
one voice and one representation.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.300
And here it does not work that way.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.720
It is specifically prohibited by

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.040
law.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.140
In Spain, this does not work.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.260
Yes, it is a pity, because really, from

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.480
my point of view, and this is an opinion,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.460
of course, it makes it very

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.700
easy to have one only interlocutor,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.060
that is, one single legal person who

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.840
is your partner, instead of dozens

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.900
or hundreds of people who can have

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.680
their opinion, their voice,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.060
no matter how much trade

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.580
unions that are via partners' pact.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.360
Well, we have students from dozens of

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.040
countries, so, simply, the important

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.040
thing is that they understand the

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.300
concept of crowdfunding

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.760
and that they evaluate how it

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.020
works with agile.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.640
Exactly, in each country,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.200
obviously, it is different, especially

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.080
in all Anglo-Saxon countries, it

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.920
is very common that there

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.560
is the possibility to invest

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.960
jointly through a single vehicle.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.400
And I, for me, of course, is a very

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.440
big advantage the countries that

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.700
can do so, of course, that I see

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800
a little that way.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.720
We also talked about a last

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.600
formula.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.580
ICOs are the initial

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.940
coin offerings.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.620
They are mechanisms that are

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.260
very much a bird's eye, which allows

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.840
you to tokenize certain assets,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.780
tokenize means giving or isolating,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.080
say, within your company,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.540
for example, a result account,

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.720
or an asset, a way of

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.500
income, even...

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.920
to isolate.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.780
Isolate it, or even a right to buy

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.920
something within your company,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.080
as it happens with Kickstarter

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.480
or with this type of crowdfunding

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.700
more of product.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.000
So what you do is say, I'm going

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.360
to launch a token, a virtual

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.240
currency, associated with a

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.360
particular product or business

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.820
line, or a right to buy a

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.060
product within my company.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.980
Then, at the end, that same, I divide

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.660
it, that unit, that token, I divide

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.780
it into many small...

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.000
You value that unit, right?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.720
and exact.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.660
You value it or, in some way, you distribute

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.900
the value of what the future may

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.900
have, because you don't know how

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.560
much that future will be worth.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.700
Well, yes, you value it with the method

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.560
you want, but if it's a current asset, that is,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.040
if it's an asset that's in the market,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.540
then it's a real asset.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.200
and exact.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.640
You usually do not look for it, you do

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.220
not look for it.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.340
Yes, there are even, look, there

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.300
are ICOs that are based on real estate

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.180
themes, right?

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.040
This house, the tokenize.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.180
I think that will clarify

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.580
us more.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.740
How would it actually work?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.600
Look, there are many more, but we

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.860
will put a concrete example, which

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.040
would be, I will buy an immovable,

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.640
this immovable, let's say that

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.580
the value of that immovable, tokenize

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.400
it, divide it into thousands

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.320
or even millions of small

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.020
shares of cents or euros,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.680
right?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.440
So I buy a percentage of

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.700
the value of this property.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.960
The day it sells, I will have access

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.640
to it.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:16.800
What is the good thing

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.200
about tokenizing these assets

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.580
or rights?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.980
That's that, apart from the secondary

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.560
market, that in itself also

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.780
generates a lot of liquidity to

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.440
the system, so that I have a way

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.700
to acquire something that I can

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.420
then sell again.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.360
That is the concept of tokenizing,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.140
let's say that we're going to hear

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.320
more and more about economics, and

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.060
that's the possibility of isolating

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.460
the value of something, which is from

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.740
my heritage, and sharing it within

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.680
a series of people...

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.640
It is divided into...

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.260
So what are you sharing?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.280
What title do you share?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.200
It is a token, it is a currency,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.560
a small cryptocurrency that is in

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.540
the end a token, it is a fraction

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.060
of that value, which in itself has

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.040
a value, and has a value, and

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.020
in addition it is subject to

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.680
a secondary market, with which it

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.000
can be sold, bought and sold.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.020
Interestingly, I imagine that this

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.580
for now will be residual, that is,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.880
there will be few companies that...

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.920
Well, last year more than $300

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.420
million in the world already moved,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.200
that is, I don't know if in 300 or

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.060
30, it was a very large amount,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.640
now I don't remember the figure,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.200
but it's a model that has the disadvantage

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.660
that it's not regulated, because

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.480
they're not stocks, they're not

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.660
securities that are subject to regulation,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.560
with which you can imagine the

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.660
volatility it has, but the advantage

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.480
is that it's very flexible and

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.880
that allows you to scale

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.260
companies much faster, and

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.200
that always taking into account

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.220
the risk, which is important.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.560


00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.800
Well, to finish this class, I will

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.120
make a look at all the formulas

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.440
you have talked about.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.500
You have started talking

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.780
about banking financing, which is

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.140
the formula that companies have been

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.400
using throughout their lives,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.220
but it is true that in the world

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.480
of start-up, because of

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.400
the great uncertainty that

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.840
there is, since usually entrepreneurs

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.220
prefer, not only entrepreneurs

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.340
prefer to opt for other formulas,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.260
but banks have not

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.500
been willing to enter

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.760
until now.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.320
We have talked about capital expansions,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.580
which is the most common formula,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.760
which recours to Business

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.380
Angels, Venture Capital, Friendfuls

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.220
of Family, etc.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.860
You've talked about convertible

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.100
notes, which are usually a temporary

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.420
instrument in the extension

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.600
rounds.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.020
You have talked about participatory

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.380
loans, which have been granted

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.440
by public entities

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.480
so far, usually, right?

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.360
We talk about crowdfunding,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.580
platforms like Start-up Explorer,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.820
for example, that allows many

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.700
small investors to enter

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000
your company, which until

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.980
now is impossible.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.700
And finally, talk about something

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.080
that is much more innovative,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.800
new, than ICOs.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.540
What is the acronym of...?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.300
Initial Coin Offering, as an initial

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.800
coin offer.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.260
Well, in that case yes.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.080
Exactly, it comes a little to change that

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.060
is something that everyone sounds like

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.560
something more based on cryptocurrencies.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.920
Well, of cryptocurrencies, which

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.880
is something, as we can understand,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.980
very new, but that you already say

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.760
that they have moved more than $300 million.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.480
I did 300 or 30.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.680
It was a lot of money, I had done

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.080
a little.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.040
Well, so is great.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:55.980
Many thanks.
