00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.790
I am convinced you already

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.150
understand what segmentation

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.770
by behavior is.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.890
We will identify different

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.450
segments of current or potential

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.290
customers based on the interactions

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.970
we have had with

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.850
them.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.190
And the next question is, well, but

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.970
how will we segment, that is,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.930
what kind of segments or what information

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.750
will we analyze?

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.930
Here the possibilities are

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.210
endless.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.850
As I have said, so much information

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.390
is generated, so many different

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.350
types of interactions are generated

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.050
with customers that we can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930
make very many different

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.710
segmentations.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.150
And sometimes certain lists or classifications

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.250
are given.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.050
But I think it makes no sense.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.430
What I want to share is a series

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.630
of examples with you and these examples

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.470
will illustrate you, will help

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.530
you visualize a little what kind

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.890
of segmentation we are doing

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.890
companies and what are the benefits

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.290
of doing it.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.630
Let’s start with a classic

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.270
segmentation that has been done

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.970
all life and that has been more

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.050
common in B2B models.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.430
It is segmentation based on

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.750
the value that customers generate.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.950
I give you an example of segmentation

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.950
A, B, C.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.270
What is this of value?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.050
So let’s segment, let’s think

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.970
of a pharmaceutical

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.330
lab that sells through pharmacies.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.490
Therefore, your customers are pharmacies

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.430
and what it does is segment

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.230
it to pharmacies based on

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.550
the sales they are generating,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.710
the volume of business they

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.910
are generating.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.870
Then there are the pharmacies A, which

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.490
are, let us put a 10% of the total,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.610
the pharmacies B and the pharmacies

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.650
C.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.550
Why segment all your customers

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.270
according to the value they

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.410
generate?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.130
To prioritize, to allocate the most

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.390
and best resources to the pharmacies

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.310
A.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.130
For example, the best

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.650
commercials or pharmacies are

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.190
visited more frequently

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.090
within the routes or offered

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.990
to others, etc.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.150
You probably understand the concept.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.770
We will allocate resources

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.150
to our best customers.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.130
We can also segment, and it is

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.530
something common, based on a different

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.970
criterion, although very related

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.730
to the above, which can be the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.150
recurrence, the number of times

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390
they buy us or the fidelity,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.590
whether they are loyal customers

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.690
or not, or the engagement

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690
we have with customers.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.970
I have mentioned three criteria,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.330
but they are quite related.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.600
And I’ll give you the example

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400
of airlines, which almost

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.280
all set up a number of segments

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.980
and set levels and offer different

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.520
services to the most loyal customers.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.660


00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.060
Or, for example, let’s think of an

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.480
application like Tulotero.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.900
Tulotero can segment its users

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.540
according to the frequency

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.660
of use or the cost that gives

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.220
equal.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.800
You can also segment into heavy users,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.360
medium users or light users.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.840
Adapt the communication

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.320
to each segment.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.560
Or, for example, with customers

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.740
who in a NPS satisfaction

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.880
survey, for example, are detractors,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.360
have put the lowest scores,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.040
with them you can have

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.200
tailored actions.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.400
Why is?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.300
Because they are risks.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.580
You could call them all.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.660
It is simply an example of how

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.600
we segment according to

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.500
loyalty, satisfaction, engagement.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.420
We are determining adapted

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.840
actions.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.120
With our best customers.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.740
We look at it as we look at it.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.120
For loyalty, for loyalty,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.440
for satisfaction.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.440
Well, we can set points

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.700
or ask them to help us with

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.920
testimonies.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.220
You can be a member of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.900
a club, etc.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.260
With our worst customers or more dissatisfied,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.180
because all the opposite.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.600
Send them fewer emails

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.980
offering you other products,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.140
send them more emails providing

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.620
support, call them by phone, etc.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.440
As you can see, there are different types

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.540
of actions that we can take.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.320
Another way of segmenting

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.700
by behavior that is currently used

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.040
by all companies, all companies

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.580
that we capture in digital

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.940
media, is based on the stage

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.260
of the conversion funnel

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.520
within the funnel, the stage

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.600
in which each of the customers

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
is.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.860
This is what we do at the Power MBA.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.260
If we think of the funnel, we have

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.000
people who have visited our

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.720
website, people who have

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.720
left us the data, people who

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.780
have interacted with us, etc.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.820
And this segmentation allows us

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.320
to address them in a totally

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.540
different way, through different

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.360
media, with different messages.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.880
Look, this I share is illustrative,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.880
simply a screen-up of the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.840
different actions, a flow

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.080
or a tree, with different

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.540
actions based on different

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.720
interactions.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.920
As you can see, it is very broad.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.360
And as a last example, I’ll

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.420
put a concept called Direct

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.640
Response Marketing, which is

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.380
to bring behavioral segmentation

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.600
to an extreme.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.320
And this we learned from Frank Kern,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.160
who is a marketing expert

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.420
in the United States.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.420
And what Frank Kern proposes and

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.140
what he does is actions like,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.720
he has many interactions with his customers

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.580
And if for example in a video, in

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.900
a video in which he goes out talking

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.980
he that lasts 20 minutes, you have

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.840
stopped watching the video before

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.300
the minute 5, he segments all those

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.080
leads or potential customers

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.100
who have stopped watching the video

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
before that minute 5 and sends

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.180
them an email telling him that

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.520
you know you have stopped watching

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.560
the video but you have lost everything

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.980
that From the interactions

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.740
with customers, what we do is

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.080
identify segments, make

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.600
adapted actions that

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.280
ultimately allow us to

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.080
optimize, allow us to sell

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.240
more to current customers,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.600
allow us to optimize the

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.660
capture, campaigns, etc.
