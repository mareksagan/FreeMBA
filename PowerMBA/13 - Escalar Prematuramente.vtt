00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.680
Before we analyze Nonavox from a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.340
more technical perspective and try

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.160
to draw some conclusions,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.860
I would like you to tell us a little

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.620
about what it consists of.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.360
First, what are your customer

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.280
segments?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.380
Nonavox had two customer segments.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.840
On the one hand, in our case it was

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.500
a subscription model aimed at the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.180
segment of pregnant women and moms

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.560
of babies up to two years, moms

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.540
and dads, and on the other

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.140
hand it was also a B2B, because

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.600
our customers were all brands

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.760
that had products aimed at

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400
our B2C customer segment.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.800
Well, that is, connecting, I would almost

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.740
say that it is a platform that has

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.020
two sides, that you connect moms

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.760
and dads, that I understand that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.740
they are basically moms, which you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.700
said for decency.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.080
Yes, there was as much as 2% of dads.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.160
Because it's more politically

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.980
correct and with brands that

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.280
sell products targeted to that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.120
customer segment.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.860
What do you offer to one and what do you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.500
offer to others?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.140
We solved two problems.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.020
We solved the problem of pregnant

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.980
women and mothers, especially

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.260
in the case of first-born

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.780
mothers, you get pregnant and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.800
suddenly you get a lot of questions.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.020
And you enter a sector where there

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.760
are very many products, five different

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.380
types of tatin, five different types

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.980
of diapers, that if they are braguita

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.140
diapers, that if they are such,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.280
that if they are not know how many

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.140
ecological, creams.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.340
That is, you enter a world of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.700
products you don't know anything

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.260
about and you normally don't have

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.320
time to research.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.420
In the end, it requires

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.060
to do tremendous market research

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
to get to the best products.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.860
So, Nonavox what I did was, hear,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.820
every month we will go sending

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.000
the products appropriate to the stage

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.140
of pregnancy or the age of the baby

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.140
and your preferences so that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.680
you do not have to waste time

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.140
looking and so you can try them

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.820
comfortably at home.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.720
And we solved the problem

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840
of this brutal competition.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600
It's a super-segmented market,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.580
with a lot of players on every

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.160
product vertical, where all

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.660
brands fight for being in

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.920
the top of mind of moms

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.200
and many of them also didn't

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.640
have the digital skills

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.900
to get it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.980
Then, we offered brands

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.320
the way to reach their potential

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.260
customers directly, people

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.460
who had told us they were

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.240
interested, for example,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520
in using a whisper, because

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.000
we sent the whisper only

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.440
to those, but then we sent

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.820
them the market study

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.360
because our clients were

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.980
encouraged by a point

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.420
system to answer questions

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.600
about the product that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.780
had sent us to the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.760
brand.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.560
How are revenue generated?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.240
You said subscribers pay

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.060
a quota.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.600
Did you have any income from

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.120
the marks?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.540
No, by the markers.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.060
Income or Expense?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.920
Income or Expense?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.280
None of.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.520
That is, brands gave the products

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.680
in exchange for being in the boxes,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.780
reaching their potential customers

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.220
and that market study we

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.080
offered them then with the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.580
customer responses to having

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.060
used their products.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.980
We came to monetize in some

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.920
cases in more specific

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.700
cases when brands used

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.320
us to test different markets.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.660
In a couple of occasions Spanish

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.600
brands used us to test,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.240
for example, the German market.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.580
So, as we had customers in Germany,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.820
they sent 5000 products there

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.100
and that market study was directed

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.860
to the interest that could be generated

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.920
in that country.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320
I understand that that line of that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.720
income stream you could have developed

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.040
much more, but let's, which

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.520
is actually not the core.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.560
The core was the 25 euros a month

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.500
a client pays.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.000
The key yesterday was, of course,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.340
the clients were receiving surprises boxes.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.360
That is, the customers didn't know what

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.540
products they were going to receive

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.400
in the box the next month.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.460
So, at the level of perceived

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.220
value, the value proposal was,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.640
you're going to pay 25 euros, you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.920
don't know what you're going to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.800
receive, but we commit to what

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.040
you're going to receive is at

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.700
least twice the value of what you've

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.200
paid.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.880
That is, at least 50 euros will be

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.660
worth the products in the box and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.020
normally they were around 60 to 70

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.680
euros.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.820
We also commit to the content that

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.960
will be interesting and that will

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.580
be adapted 100 percent to your stage

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.420
of pregnancy, the age of your

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.840
baby and your preferences.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.780
We will never repeat the products.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.180
One doubt that arises to me is the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.760
value that customers perceive is by

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.300
knowing products or by using the products

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.320
themselves.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.980
There were two legs.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.420
I was the ear-foot, it is that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.020
I am discovering products that allow

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.500
me to be the most guay mom in the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.660
park or kindergarten, because

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.960
suddenly my child carries a super

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.620
niche French brand that has just

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.500
arrived in Spain or I have discovered

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.540
a super innovative product

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.100
that is still not known in

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.900
Spain.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.560
And on the other hand, there

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.380
was the cholo mentality we all

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.660
have.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.080
Of course, I'm paying 25 euros

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.120
and only this hairdresser that has

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.160
come to me in the box is already

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.440
worth 25 euros.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.480
But it's that I also have

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.160
a cream, I have a pot and I have

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.600
two more toys and a star

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.340
cream for me.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.180
Then it was those two mentalities

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.320
that were very good because it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.700
allowed us to cover a very

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.640
wide segment of customers.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.280
It was my mom that what seemed

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.120
to her most valuable proposal was

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.760
that and I am discovering a super

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.340
exclusive fragrance for my baby

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.440
or a super innovative, super

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.800
technological product.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.000
And I was the mom who said hearing

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.820
is that it is that only this cream

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.420
of 15 euros has already practically

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.780
paid me what it entered.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.500
What would you say were the

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.240
key metrics of the business model?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.080
Clarely, I believe as in all, but

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.340
in this case more, being a recurring

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.540
business, the cost of capture,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.160
but above all the recurrence,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.060
that costumer life value and the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.880
churn, that in addition to the

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.340
churn we did an analysis of

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.020
cuts and the churn allowed us

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.860
to see the quality of the boxes.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.560
At the end we had an excel in which

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.720
we know that the clients stay

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.020
with us, it depended on the country,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.460
but the average was 14 months,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.960
14 months, 14 months.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.580
That was our big challenge, that is,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.100
the big challenge, and all that allowed

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.100
us to load ourselves to the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.060
competition in many countries was

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.860
the algorithm we developed, which

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.480
allowed us to make 250 different

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.760
types of boxes instead of those 250.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.320
Because you get a box that doesn't quarter

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.900
you and you automatically disabout.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.360
In fact, that was the main

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.740
reason why mothers were

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.860
down was why.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.420
Look, I think of one of the classes

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.860
we've seen in The Power MBA

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.980
and are the different

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.980
growth engines.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.880
So, depending on the growth engine,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.020
it is necessary to understand it very

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.560
well and monitor some metrics or others.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960
So, there is one that is called,

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.380
which we have called sticky

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.500
or sticky and in which the company

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.460
has to be obsessed with the lifetime,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.260
not only with the economic value,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.840
but with the time frame

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.620
and has to permanently monitor

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.940
the churn rate.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.120
And so what you say, that was an

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.160
absolute almost obsession,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.760
because based on those churn rate

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.260
shortcuts you had to analyze whether

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.360
you were delivering

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.860
boxes of higher quality or less.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.840
Just because our product changed

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.880
every month and every month we

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.680
launched a new product and the

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.740
success that had that product,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.960
the acceptance that I had would

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.320
depend on the number of customers

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.820
we had the following month.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.980
That is, it wasn't like a

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.440
cosmetic company that has the same

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.980
cream and sells it every month.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.140
In our case, we had a product

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.340
that was constantly evolving

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.420
and we had to be continuously

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.240
learning and improving.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.880
Then, the churn was the key metric,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.020
because at the end people are disabling,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.300
they are subscribing again, they sometimes

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.480
give you reasons for not being

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.860
dismissed because they have forgotten

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.340
me, but the numbers don't fail,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.180
the numbers don't lie.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.920
So, that churn metric, we knew

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.100
that automatically led us

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.620
to look first at the quality of

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.820
the box and if not the logistics

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.040
partner.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.160
Back to the class

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.960
conclusions we saw about

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.960
the growth engine.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.780
One of the conclusions I said about

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.780
this Sticky growth engine is

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.420
that you worry less about

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.020
the CPA, all the metrics

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.800
have to worry you, but it's

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.060
almost better to focus on one.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.860
And if you think of a box with a monthly

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.820
ARPU of 25 euros, I don't know what

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.100
your CPA was, but the key, the

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.160
real leverage is the churn, that

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.260
is, because with 25 euros a month

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.280
you get to stay 5 months more,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.460
that's much more sensitive than

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.720
the CPA, which can raise you

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.680
5 or 10 euros, I don't know.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.240
If at the end of the churn what you

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.280
are measuring is the quality of the

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.380
product and if the product is good,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.800
the CPA ends up dropping, because

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.220
at the end you viralize more.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.840
If your moms are delighted, they are

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.220
your best ambassadors.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.580
But if you order if you send a bad

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.380
box a month, it will affect

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.480
you as well as the CPA, because

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.000
you will start creating a

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.320
bad online reputation that

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.000
will make you cost a lot more

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.820
to get customers.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.920
We at the end was a product one that

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.260
was not necessary and two that was as

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.540
very mysterious, because I said people

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.080
I'm going to pay 25 euros a month for

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.600
something I don't know what is what

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.760
they're going to send me.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.180
So, in our case, the prescription

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.780
of the clients we already had was

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.980
fundamental, because it was

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.520
what generated the new clients

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.920
security of the value, I will pay

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.760
25 euros, I don't know what they

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.820
will send me, but all of these

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.300
are happy with what they have

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.340
received.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.800
So, for us to send a bad box was

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.600
an absolute drama, because you

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.120
not only lost the clients

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.520
you already had, but started to

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.800
fill the web with bad comments

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.140
about your box and automatically

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.980
raised the CPA of the new clients,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.120
because you cost a lot more

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.440
to give the credibility

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.760
that they came with you.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.460
What was the CPA?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.860
The average CPA was 15 euros.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.080
Of course, if we think it is very clear,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.620
the important thing was not the CPA, because

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.780
it is that you would take out

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.100
25 euros per month for each customer.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.080
That is, only you could improve

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.380
a little the product and lower the soil

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.520
a little, and that instead of 10

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.560
months, to say something, it is in

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.040
15, because it is that...

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.860
It is exponential.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.240
It's not that every month you get more

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.280
you are already, it's that you're

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.040
exceeding the cost of customer

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.380
capture.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.880
That is, in addition, by the business

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.820
model, as the product that went

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.920
inside the boxes, we

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.140
got it without cost of the

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.740
brands, our costs were only

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.280
the shipping, the box and picking.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.260
That is, nothing more.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.380
That is, we had some margins, depending

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.920
also on the country, but of 60 percent,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.780
65 percent.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.620
Then, of course, that impact on the

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.080
costumer live value was immediately

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.460
noticed by having such high

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.120
margins.
