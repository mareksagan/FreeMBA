00:00.000 --> 00:15.340
Before we see what are the mechanisms or methods to set the price, what I want is that you

00:15.340 --> 00:21.920
keep in mind, what I want to reinforce, that the pricing strategy is really important.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.520
Warren Buffett tells us, it seems to me that it is a bit exaggerated, but he says that the

00:25.520 --> 00:29.860
main variable to evaluate a business is the ability of that business to set

00:29.860 --> 00:30.860
the price.

00:30.860 --> 00:34.360
As I was saying, I think it is exaggerated, I think he is thinking of the companies that

00:34.360 --> 00:39.580
he likes, which have such a barrier of entry, which have a lot of power to set the price

00:39.580 --> 00:42.460
or to lead the price of that market.

00:42.460 --> 00:49.420
But hey, in any case, keep in mind that if you are able to set the optimal price,

00:49.420 --> 00:53.780
it will have a huge impact on your business and also, it is that curiously, this is something

00:53.780 --> 01:00.140
that is usually ignored and the managers or the businessmen tend to forget about the price

01:00.140 --> 01:01.900
as one of the key levers.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.860
Demand is usually thought of as increasing, spending more in marketing, reducing costs,

01:05.860 --> 01:06.860
etc.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.460
But think about it, the price is usually forgotten.

01:10.460 --> 01:17.540
I like to draw the pricing strategy from a target.

01:17.540 --> 01:22.220
We have a target and the ideal goal would be to say in the center, that we were able

01:22.220 --> 01:25.180
to set the optimal price.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.980
The optimal price with a double goal.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.740
It is not only to maximize the economic benefit, the price influences the margin that you are going

01:34.740 --> 01:39.100
to have, it influences the demand on the number of products or services that you are going to sell.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.580
This is the purely economic part.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.940
But be careful, keep in mind that this is not just about maximizing the economic goal,

01:46.940 --> 01:50.980
we have to take into account that the price is part of the story that you are telling.

01:50.980 --> 01:56.660
It is part of your brand, it is part of your positioning, it is part of your competitive strategy.

01:56.660 --> 02:00.620
Therefore, when we look at prices, we have to take into account both perspectives.

02:00.620 --> 02:06.380
I say this because there are companies that, within their marketing mix strategy, when

02:06.380 --> 02:11.140
they reach the price, what they do is think only in the economic part and, for example,

02:11.140 --> 02:17.300
they abuse discounts, promotions or outlet-type channels, etc.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.340
and in the end what they are doing is destroying their brand.

02:21.340 --> 02:25.700
Perhaps they manage to maximize the economic benefit in the short term, they get what they

02:25.700 --> 02:29.700
are looking for, but they are destroying their brand and in the end that is not sustainable.

02:29.700 --> 02:37.180
Well, what I want us to learn is, we have seen the target, we have the target or perhaps

02:37.180 --> 02:40.100
we can also illustrate it with a blank sheet.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.500
How are we going to set the price?

02:42.500 --> 02:43.500
What are we going to focus on?

02:43.500 --> 02:47.540
Well, I want you to know that there is a triple approach, a triple perspective.

02:47.540 --> 02:53.380
There are mainly three references that could be considered three methods of price setting,

02:53.380 --> 02:59.140
but the reality, what I am telling you is that these three methods or approaches, or whatever

02:59.140 --> 03:04.340
we want to call it, are usually used together in greater or lesser measure.

03:04.340 --> 03:07.220
You are going to understand it now.

03:07.220 --> 03:13.220
There are three, cost, competition and value.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.940
We are going to set the price based on our cost.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.460
What we do is calculate the fixed and variable costs, the direct and indirect costs, as you

03:19.460 --> 03:25.980
want, apply a margin, which is the money we want to earn, and set our price.

03:25.980 --> 03:30.740
This has been, this was the usual method of traditional price setting.

03:30.740 --> 03:35.380
And if, for example, we think of distribution channels of the traditional ones, there is

03:35.380 --> 03:40.540
a manufacturer that has a manufacturing cost of those products, in addition, it is usually

03:40.540 --> 03:47.180
a very high cost, it can have a very high estimate, and what it does is apply a markup.

03:47.180 --> 03:51.860
The markup is the increase in that price and it is sold to a distributor or a wholesaler.

03:51.860 --> 03:57.500
Well, as we move forward in the supply chain, everyone applies their markup and

03:57.500 --> 03:59.100
obtains a profitability.

03:59.100 --> 04:03.580
The distributor, the retailer, usually applies a higher percentage, etc.

04:03.580 --> 04:08.500
What are the pros of setting your price based on the cost?

04:08.500 --> 04:15.020
Well, it is relatively simple and the main advantage is that you are ensuring, in principle,

04:15.020 --> 04:20.180
I say in principle because it may not be sold, you are ensuring a profitability or

04:20.180 --> 04:21.180
margins, some benefits.

04:21.180 --> 04:26.900
The disadvantage is that you are forgetting about the client and you are forgetting about the competition

04:26.900 --> 04:32.460
and this has happened, for example, with the arrival of globalization, that there are manufacturers

04:32.460 --> 04:38.780
that in any sector that have arrived competitors of markets or low-cost countries, with a

04:38.780 --> 04:44.100
much lower structure, and of course, if both use the same pricing method,

04:44.100 --> 04:49.700
with products more or less similar, the one that has a much lower cost structure

04:49.700 --> 04:53.060
will earn a lot of money, it will stay with the market.

04:53.060 --> 04:59.540
Therefore, as we have seen, it is relatively easy to calculate, you are ensuring

04:59.540 --> 05:03.580
that you are going to earn X money, you know it in advance, what happens is that you are forgetting

05:03.580 --> 05:07.140
about the competition and you are forgetting about the client.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.900
By the way, this simple estimate is something important because in many cases it is not

05:11.900 --> 05:16.460
so easy to calculate, it is very difficult to calculate the price, it is also very difficult

05:16.460 --> 05:18.140
to calculate your costs.

05:18.140 --> 05:23.700
Well, let's go to the second approach, we are going to set the price based on the competition,

05:23.700 --> 05:29.140
this is perhaps the simplest approach, something that is good because we have a very clear

05:29.140 --> 05:34.260
price, we know in which market we are, we do a market study, we analyze what are

05:34.260 --> 05:39.980
the prices that the different competitors have and what we do is choose a price a little

05:39.980 --> 05:45.060
higher or a little lower depending on whether we are better or worse, it is very easy.

05:45.060 --> 05:49.340
Let's think, for example, this is usually done whenever you want to sell a house,

05:49.340 --> 05:55.820
what you do is analyze the average price of the square meter in the neighborhood where

05:55.820 --> 06:00.900
you are selling your house and depending on the qualities, whether it is reformed or not,

06:00.900 --> 06:03.260
the one that the farm reads, etc., what you do is put a higher or lower price, it is

06:03.260 --> 06:05.500
very easy to set the price like this.

06:05.500 --> 06:13.060
Benefits, well, it is easy, as we have said, it is very simple, disadvantages, you are forgetting

06:13.060 --> 06:16.580
about your cost, you may be losing money and you are also forgetting about the client and

06:16.580 --> 06:21.220
there is another one and that is that when industries work like this and all competitors what they

06:21.220 --> 06:27.060
do is look at others, look at what the competition does to set the price, in the end you are forgetting

06:27.060 --> 06:29.420
about the client and you are missing many opportunities.

06:29.420 --> 06:36.380
And we go to the third of the perspectives, the third of the perspectives is that you look,

06:36.380 --> 06:41.740
you forget about your cost, everything you can, you forget about the competition, everything

06:41.740 --> 06:46.420
you can and what you do is set a price based on the value that you are providing to the client,

06:46.420 --> 06:50.940
if you provide more value to the client you will have a higher price and you will earn more money.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.820
In some cases, not only the value, but for example if your clients are captive clients,

06:55.820 --> 06:59.580
if there are high costs of exchange, if there are entry barriers, if you are in a situation

06:59.580 --> 07:05.860
almost of monopoly, well, what you do is raise the price because the client

07:05.860 --> 07:09.420
cannot change, it is not really value, but the client in the end for one reason or another

07:09.420 --> 07:12.220
will pay you.

07:12.220 --> 07:18.260
This is perhaps the most orthodox and most client-centric way to set the price, what

07:18.260 --> 07:22.700
happens is that we have seen the three, cost, competition and value, depending on the type

07:22.700 --> 07:28.260
of market in which you are, you can choose or you can give more weight to one approach than to another.

07:28.260 --> 07:33.660
If we are in markets, we are going to put an extreme, we are in very commoditized markets,

07:33.660 --> 07:40.000
in which all competitors, for example, have very undifferentiated proposals and also

07:40.000 --> 07:46.420
the client almost chooses by price, in this case it does make sense to use competition

07:46.460 --> 07:51.220
mainly competition and almost what you can do is set the same price as

07:51.220 --> 07:55.220
competition and you know that you are going to have a part of the market.

07:55.220 --> 08:01.580
If we go to the extreme of very differentiated markets, in which clients perceive a lot of

08:01.580 --> 08:05.380
value and there is a lot of difference between one provider and another, here there is much more

08:05.380 --> 08:07.460
margin to set the price depending on the value.
