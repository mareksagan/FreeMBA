00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.360
Now we will make the customer's journey

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.800
summarized in the case of a restaurant.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.420
We'll think of a restaurant, the

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.080
typical restaurant that's close

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.280
to a office and we'll think of

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.780
that type of customer, the client

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.540
who works around and has a break

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.220
to go out to eat and what

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.640
it does is go to a restaurant

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.760
that's close to the office

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.580
in a group with your friends

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.640
or workmates.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.560
The first thing to do is to define

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.700
the entire customer journey.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.100
The customer enters, seeks a table or

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.520
is assigned a table, sits, asks

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.120
for a drink, asks for food or chooses

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.780
food, eats, goes to the bathroom

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.820
or goes out, asks for dessert, asks

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.320
for coffee, pays, etc.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.000
It is important to identify all

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.360
the touch points, so we don'

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.460
t lose anything.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.360
Well, we will do an exercise with

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.520
this restaurant, a diagnosis

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
and we will think mainly about

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.920
three touch points and also

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.700
we will think about the customer

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.540
person I have told you that

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.860
is someone who works in the offices

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.500
around and we will think

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
about what their motivations are.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.180
We start with the moment they

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.240
ask for food.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.760
What are customers wanting?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.460
What they want is to be quick because

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.960
they don't want to be waiting because

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.380
they're hungry at two and a half

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.920
and because they don't have

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.480
time to wait and they don'

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.120
t want to get bored.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.680
And when the diagnosis was made

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.100
it turns out that the customer

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.220
experience at this point was bad

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.600
and was bad for the two reasons

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.340
I told you.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.300
One, because there was to wait

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.100
too much because the work

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.380
of the waiters, the different

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.820
tables, etc. was not optimized,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.860
and because all the customers

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.100
arrive at that time.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.040
And the customers also find that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.220
when asked they were bored because

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.320
they were going to the same restaurant

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.880
for a long time and it turns

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.780
out that the letter was always

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.820
the same, so the experience

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.740
was bad.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.380
What decision did the restaurant make?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.580
Well, what he did is increase the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.860
number of waiters despite that he

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.240
actually had a surcharge

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.180
and another decision he made

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.300
very simple is, in addition to the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.400
fixed letter, adding some

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.300
extra per week so that customers

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.940
did not get bored.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.120
Now we go to the main

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.020
touchpoint, Troncal, in

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.360
a restaurant that is the time

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.200
when customers eat.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.260
And here was the effort

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.280
to identify what customers

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.800
want in this type of restaurant.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.860
Well, it turns out that an

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.660
increasing percentage of customers

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.220
were concerned because, of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.240
course, when eating every day

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.380
out they wanted the food to be

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.860
healthy, but that the restaurant

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.440
had not taken into account.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
Obviously everyone appreciates

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.160
that food is good, but this

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.060
concept of healthy, of

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.300
healthy, was growing.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.400
And the restaurant had never

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.680
taken it into account, so the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.140
customer experience, of an increasing

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.320
percentage of customers,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.920
was being bad.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.460
Therefore, another decision was made,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.160
incorporating healthy dishes.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960
And finally, we go to the last of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.140
the touchpoints, which is the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.900
time to pay.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.900
It's a time when you've just eaten,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.540
you're already thinking you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.760
want to go back to the office

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.040
and what you don't want is to wait.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.080
And here we find that, once again,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.800
the customer experience, the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.120
customer didn't feel good, the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.780
customer experience wasn't good,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.520
because they had to wait too

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.320
long, because what was being

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.540
given is that at that same

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.120
moment, of course, all the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.600
tables were just eating.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.000
What was the solution?

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.500
The solution was that it could be paid

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.040
in the box.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.340
Then, the waiters derive all customers

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.800
to pay the box and the process

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.900
of collecting in the box is

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.320
much more efficient.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.160
So you finish your coffee or finish

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.360
your dessert, what you do is

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.060
get up and pay the box without

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.560
waiting for the bill to be brought,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.380
without waiting for the dataphone

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.040
to be brought, etc.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.500
In the box, the process is much more

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.260
efficient.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.760
I think it is a good example

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.200
of how to have done customer

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.420
journey mapping and exposed

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.480
it to the customer's shoes

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.180
helped us identify what customers

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.160
want at each point, helped

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.360
us identify a series of moments

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.400
of the truth of key points

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.360
in which the experience

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.000
was being bad and improved

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.640
in a very simple way

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.480
that helped improve

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.020
the customer

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.160
experience.
