00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.800
Now we go to the outcome, at the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.780
end of the story, but this

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.180
is really important.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.620
What we have to show at this point

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.700
is that it is what our client is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.220
playing, because we have already identified

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.580
his problem, we have shown him that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.500
we can help him, he has validated

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.780
us as someone who can help

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.660
him, we have told him how to do

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.820
it, we have asked him to do it,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.640
but if he is not aware that something

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.280
is being played, that he makes

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.240
the decision, he will not do

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.520
it, because people don't buy

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.480
for buying.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.400
So, the end of the story has

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.520
to go aimed at that, you have to

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.160
go aimed at telling the customer

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.500
what risk or what problem you will

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.660
help him avoid, what is what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.500
happens if he doesn't, and I'm going

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040
to put an example, a financial

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
advisor, a financial advisor has

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.120
to identify what are the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.480
problems he's helping to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.660
avoid his client, and if he

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.100
does it well and communicates

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.540
it through his communications with

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.760
customers, they'll have a lot

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.700
of impact, what are the problems

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.080
he helps to avoid, what is what

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.560
happens if you don't hire me,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.340
you can lose your money, maybe

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.440
your current advisors are

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.460
very little transparent

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.400
or don't devote you time,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.920
or things will change or

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.420
you won't have money

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.860
to retire, etc.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.560
As you can see, identifying

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.060
them, let's say that the problems

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.500
we help avoid is a very powerful

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.220
motivator for people because we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.600
are more willing to make decisions

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
to avoid a problem than to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.960
get a benefit is ultra proven,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.880
and on the other hand what we

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.440
have to do is permanently

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.880
help them visualize how they

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.200
will change their lives,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.540
what is it will get if you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.760
buy us.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.140
If you look, a lot of communication

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.780
campaigns are exactly this,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.860
happy people, people who have

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.340
achieved it, etc., because we

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.280
have to help the customer visualize

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.400
what is what it will, if not,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.380
it will not do, you can

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.560
understand it more rationally

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.180
but you have to make it see,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.260
and you have to make it see

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.620
repeatedly because the history

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.400
of your company goes about

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.220
that, as I have said, the history

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.240
of your company is that your

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.880
product is able to make the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.440
life of your customer better,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.980
and what are those benefits

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.320
you can get, well, because

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.700
as we have seen above are,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.900
usually what we are looking

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.040
for are very basic things,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.760
how it will be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.060
to your life after,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.280
it will gain status,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.640
it will gain recognition,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.280
it will gain security, it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.840
will reduce the anxiety,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.040
it will have more time,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
you will make things

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.380
easier in your day to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.700
day, you will connect

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.920
with other people
