00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.090
I will share with you 5 tips

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.710
that will help us improve a

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.330
website.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.390
The goal is to convey in the simplest

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.510
possible way to the protagonist,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.630
our potential customer,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.830
how we can help him.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.950
We will learn how to create or

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.450
improve the headline or title.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.710
We will learn to create authority

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.690
to position ourselves as someone

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.050
who can help our client.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.570
Let’s look at the two types of call

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
to action, the type of incorporation

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510
and, finally, how to simplify

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.070
texts.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.610
First of all, I want to remind you

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.990
that the website has to pass

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.710
the test that we can call the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.330
test of the minimum effort.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.290
And what consists?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.970
In 5 seconds, everyone who visits

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.930
our website or at least those

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.790
who are the target audience

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.390
must understand.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.630
1st

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.250
What do we do?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.930
2nd

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.670
How can we help them?

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.730
and 3.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.770
What do they have to do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.190
to do business with us or

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.950
to buy us?

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.830
In 5 seconds, if your website

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.890
fails, what you have to do

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.910
is simplify and improve messages.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.880
We start with the headline.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.740
The title, what is it?, is the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.920
phrase you find on the top

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.140
of a web page when you enter.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.300
By the way, it’s not just text,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.380
it’s text plus images and both

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080
should translate the message

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.980
in a consistent way.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.480
First, what is the purpose of the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.060
headline?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.280
The goal is that the protagonist,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.740
your potential customer when you enter

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.780
from the beginning, identify that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.220
you are talking about him, that you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.360
have something that is good for him,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.860
that you can help him.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.020
So don’t start talking in the headline

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.320
or in the headline, don’t start

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.820
talking about what makes you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.220
different from the details of your

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.960
product, etc.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.040
Don’t get bored with that because so what

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.120
happens is that the protagonist enters

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.380
and leaves because you haven’t generated

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.900
interest.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.820
The headline has to be customer-

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.560
centric, it has to talk about your

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.720
customer.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.300
It’s very difficult when

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800
we face a blank web page, it’s

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.860
very difficult to write the copies,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.360
but more still the headline

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.840
because it’s also the most important

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820
of all.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.300
Here we can support ourselves

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400
in three references.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.540
One, what we can do is to transfer

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.020
the profits that our product

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.500
will generate to the protagonist

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.060
and I put you again the example

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.880
of Frank Kern who has identified

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.860
that the true desire of his

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.480
potential customer is to generate

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.380
more wealth and says it directly

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.220
in the owner and so clings

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.780
interest from the beginning.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.380
Second, what we can do is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.880
identify a problem and say

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.000
we will solve it.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.040
In the case of ActiCampaign that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.140
is a marketing automation

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.080
software that we use and that we

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.340
recommend to everyone, what

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.820
it says in the title is that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.240
finally there is a marketing

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.160
automation tool that

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340
in addition to powerful is

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.800
easy to use.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.640
What you are telling us is that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.100
you are solving a problem because

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.560
the rest of the tools or the rest

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.380
of the tools in the simplest

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.760
possible way do what you do.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.140
Let everyone understand it.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.140
We help you hire the right real

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.180
estate agent in Dayton, Ohio.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.340
See how clearly it tells us what

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.360
they do, not just what they do but

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.580
where they do it.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.580
More simple, more impossible.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.040
Or in this case we organize your

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.240
things to make your life better.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.280
In this case, as you can see, they have

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.480
chosen to combine what they do with the profit.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.720
In addition to a very aspirational

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.960
benefit that is we make your

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840
life easier.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.200
Keep up with all three recommendations.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.140
It will be much easier to

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.180
generate the title.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.070
Let’s go to the second of the advice.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.970
How to generate authority on the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.790
website.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.930
Why do we want to build authority?

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.790
Because at some point we have

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.290
to position ourselves as the guide

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.770
or as the solution to the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.770
problems of our potential customers.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.370
And our potential customer will

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.550
assess us if we are able

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.530
to help you.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.350
We need to build authority.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.730
There are different tactics on the

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.830
website to do this.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.450
You can, for example, put the logos

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.230
of the companies you have worked with.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.770
You can put testimonies from people

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.930
who are recognized and who are recommending you.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.930
You can rely on the number of customers

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.370
you already have.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.730
You can rely on customer testimonials

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.530
in both text and video.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.210
In videos they are very powerful.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.370
You can also support that

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.790
almost all companies do in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.110
the mentions you have had

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.250
in the main media that

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.730
generates a lot of trust.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.070
Now, let’s go to the call to action.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.410
At some point you have to

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.490
ask your client to make a decision.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.850
If you don’t, you won’t make the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.890
decision, I guarantee you.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.330
There are two types of call to action.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.510
We have direct call

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.750
to action where you are

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.710
basically asking, so in

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.950
some cases you buy, subscribe,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.670
etc.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.310
And transitional call

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.570
to action where you will give

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.150
more information, allow you

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.270
to do a test, etc.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.570
Because the customer is not

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.050
ready for the call to action.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.310
But the direct call to action

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.330
always has to be visible, to be

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.370
in another color, highlighted,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.890
etc.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.190
The customer needs to know that

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.630
you are asking him to do that.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.710
Another thing is that you give

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.910
him the opportunity to try yourself differently

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.130
or to start having a relationship

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.290
with you in another way, which would

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.370
be the transitional.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.630
If you can, combine the two.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.880
In addition, on web pages it is

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.920
very convenient that you use images

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.280
of happy, smiling people, etc.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.820
Why is?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.320
This is very naive, but it is

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.080
really effective.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.000
You have to be constantly

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.180
at the protagonist and

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.020
tell him what he will.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.900
What is it that he will?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.200
How will your life improve if you buy it?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.320
So if you move those images

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.580
it is more powerful than if what

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.540
you are doing is moving images,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.920
because imagine your building,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.660
your offices or your product,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.380
etc.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.720
Because people don’t want that.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.420
People want to be happier,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.220
point.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.320
And finally, it is a very common sense

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.680
recommendation, but that very

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.000
many people forget and is that

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.920
you have to use as little text

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.140
as better.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.840
Why is?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.100
Because basically the fewer

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.600
words you put, the less text

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.400
you put, the more likely

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.040
people will read it.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.220
You’ll have been thousands of times that

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.800
we enter a web page and there’s so much

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.720
text that it’s shattered and what

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.780
you do is close it.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.400
You don’t even know where to start.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
What you have to do is

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.500
translate the story we have

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.880
created with as few words

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.000
as possible.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.660
It is true that in many cases

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.700
we have to give information to

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.860
the protagonist, but what you can

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.380
do is hierarchize it.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.880
That is, you do not have to incorporate

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.740
the entire text, for example,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.040
on the home page or in the

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.800
initial form.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.580
Think of it on a first date.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.040
At a first date, you won’

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.300
t tell everything.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.900
What you have to do is to generate interest.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.520
And then on a website, well,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.540
because you can have other sections.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.280
You can send more information

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.860
in an email, pdf, etc.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.160
Do not shake up from the beginning.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.360
And the advice I give you is that

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.260
what you do permanently is

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.520
put yourself in a customer’

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.460
s shoes, go into your website, read

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.100
everything you put in and

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.440
try to reduce.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.800
Analyze how.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.360
If I have used 50 words in

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.720
this phrase to convey an idea,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.760
how can I make it much

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.780
simpler?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.400
And do it permanently.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.440
And what you will get is that the messages

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.540
from your website will reach much

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.140
more.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.360
First, what you’ll get

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.620
is people to read them.
