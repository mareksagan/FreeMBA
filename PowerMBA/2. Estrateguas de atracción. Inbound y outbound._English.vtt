00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.050
It is very important to understand the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.890
difference between the two approaches

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.170
of marketing that is outbound marketing

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.490
and inbound marketing.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.010
Start with outbound.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.690
It is the traditional approach,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.890
it is the approach in which we do

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.550
what we do is to impact the target

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.690
audience by means of advertising,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.390
advertising we pay, regardless

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.550
of whether that advertising appears

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.750
in a media or is an advertisement

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.830
in a social network or you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.030
send an email, it doesnâ€™

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.250
t matter, but it is advertising

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.970
that you send.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.930
Inbound marketing is the opposite

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.790
approach.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.890
Instead of us going to the customer,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.830
the customer comes to us.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.030
How is?

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.850
In different ways.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110
Imagine that you have interesting

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.830
content in a news or that you have

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.650
a newsletter or, for example,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.530
that you are well positioned

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.970
in a search engine.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630
Well, in all those cases, as you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.050
see, it is different because it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.010
is the customer who, based on

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.930
a content that interests him or a

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.610
search in a search engine, etc., freely

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.230
decides to go to your website.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.850
The customer goes for you.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630
Outbound marketing is said to be

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.290
push marketing and inbound is

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.730
pull, which is quite representative.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.530
One important point to keep

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.690
in mind is that in the case

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.070
of outbound marketing, the traffic

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.530
we are attracting to our

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.370
website or app facilities

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.370
is paid.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.750
It cost us directly.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.750
We paid directly for bringing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.630
that person.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.170
In the case of the Inbound, this is not the case.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.390
This is called organic

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670
traffic.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.330
There is traffic that is paid and there

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.650
is traffic that is organic.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.270
Inbound marketing has costs, obviously,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.150
because you have to generate

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.690
all that content, have a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.130
channel through which to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.450
publish it, etc.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.450
But youâ€™re not paying

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.410
directly for each of those visits.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.470
That is the difference.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.370
What are the keys?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.510
In outbound marketing,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.090
you know the key.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.350
First, you have to have money

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.910
and secondly what you have to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.530
do is optimize messages,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.270
channels, etc.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.730
In the case of the Inbound is different.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.290
The key is not that.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.190
The key is that you are able to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.730
generate very attractive content,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.750
to create a lot of value, to generate

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.590
relationships, that is, to generate

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.230
interaction with potential

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.470
customers, etc.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.790
If you do this well, a lot of people will

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.730
end up on your website.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.090
More differences between the two approaches

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.450
should be taken into account.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750
In the case of outbound marketing, the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.070
advantage is that it is more short-

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.710
term and depends on investment.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.150
That is, if you have money and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.310
you want to grow quickly, what

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.190
we do is hire campaigns and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.730
reach more people and grow.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.950
In the case of the Inbound, the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.450
disadvantage is that it is not so.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.770
It is not so short-term.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.190
This is a medium-term strategy.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.790
This is a more uncertain strategy.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.430
You can be spending resources to generate

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.830
what we will have.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.850
However, it is true that inbound

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.390
marketing, in the end, if

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.550
we manage to do it well, has

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.390
huge advantages over outbound.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.930
To begin with, the long-term cost

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.350
will be lower because you are not

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.030
paying directly for that traffic.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.890
Moreover, and very importantly,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.270
the conversion ratio of visits

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.110
is higher.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.550
This is ultra-proven.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.490
It is also common sense.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.930
It is much higher the ratio of a visit

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.130
whose origin is, for example,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.270
that you are looking for in a search

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.370
engine or that you are subscribed to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.290
your newsletter and like the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.250
content you share or that you have

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.050
read a news about you in a medium

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.930
and interest you and go to your

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.590
website.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.590
The conversion rate of those

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.530
visits is much higher than

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.250
the people we are impacting

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.930
through advertising.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.290
In many cases, you can attract that

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.670
advertising, but itâ€™s just a banner

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.810
youâ€™ve read that you hardly know

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.270
what the proposal is, etc.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.370
Therefore, the advantages of Inbound

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.850
are that, in addition to generating

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.050
more customer value, it is more

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.970
sustainable in terms of costs in the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.710
medium term and, in addition, the conversion

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.310
ratio of visits is higher.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.450
Therefore, if we are able, it

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.130
is always recommended

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.790
to develop a strategy, to

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.730
encourage inbound marketing

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.470
strategies.
