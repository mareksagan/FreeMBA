WEBVTT

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.100
We are talking about that you

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.220
have identified two segments, you have

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.440
two segments, those that are

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.660
aware of climate change and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.040
those that are not.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.820
You are segmenting them according to that.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.280
What variable are you using?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.700
Well, it is a variable of attitude,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
depending on your attitude

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.440
to something specific, in

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.840
this case, to climate change.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.550
If we had to choose one segmentation

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.230
variable, one, but the one

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.770
that helps us most to adapt

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.330
our proposal to each of the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.110
segments, to adapt our messages,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.990
etc., which would be?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.390
I think the most powerful of all is

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.210
to segment according to what they

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.630
buy you for, the benefit that each

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.770
of your customer segments

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.290
are looking for.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.410
Because in the end, yes, they will have

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.950
different attitudes, they can have,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.790
demographically, because they will

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.270
have an age, a profession, whatever

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.110
it is, right?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.830
But really the most important thing

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.030
in the end is the benefit they

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.870
seek in you.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.130
If you have to choose a variable,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.950
this is the option.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.850
Firmographic variables are like

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.770
demographic variables, which is what

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.290
happens to B2B models.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.750
We have B2C.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.230
This is a question a little to pile.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.070
The firmographic variables are

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.450
the size of the company, the number

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.890
of employees and so on.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.090
Psychological and behavioral

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.870
variables, what are they?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
To know who they are, to know how they

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.990
are, to better understand the relationship

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.070
with our customers.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.670
The right answer is how our

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.650
customers are.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.810
Think we’re talking about segmenting

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.030
them according to their attitudes,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.650
their profile, how they are, conservative,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.810
things like that, right?

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.450


00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.590
Cosmopolitan, adventurous, well,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.450
because they help us understand

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.810
how our customers are.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.690
In a gym, we segment according to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.710
the benefit they are looking for.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.730
What segments would come out?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.930
Those who want to lose weight, those

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.010
who want to have a good time, those

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.150
who want to gain muscle mass,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.510
are clearly benefits.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.710
We are segmenting according to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.630
the benefits.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.750
If we look at the other two, those

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.950
who go to collective classes, do

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.330
cardio, because in this case we

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.970
are segmenting, for example, according

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.290
to how they use us.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.710
What is the value of our offer,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.310
of everything we offer?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.590
Or those who go to noon, those who

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.790
go in the morning, because it is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.150
also a segmentation based on use.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.790
Therefore, it is clearly the first.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.460
To identify your customer people

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.400
you must cross all the variables,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.300
all.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.200
Remember that you already know

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.540
how to segment by many variables,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.620
age, gender, use, profile, for what,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.960
what you think of the competition,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.640
etc.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.560
Because what you do is cross all,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680
you will get thousands of customer

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.400
people out, so it is impossible.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.620
How can you identify your customer

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.220
people?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100
Because there are two options, from

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.740
segmentation and research or directly,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.000
and this I usually recommend,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.660
is that you identify specific customers,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.440
that you fix on specific customers

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.860
with name and surname that are

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.520
representative of your customer

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.480
segments and that what you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.080
do is focus on them.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.420
And even if you think it’s not a representative

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.520
sample, I’m sure if you have chosen

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.600
them well and you study them

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.960
and analyze how to sell them better,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.560
etc.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.800
And you have them very present, it will

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.320
help you sell a lot more to your

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.920
entire market.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900
So both options are good.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.800
To describe and be able to sell

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.200
better to your customer person,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.820
that is, to understand it better,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.900
you must always use all the variables,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.100
all, sex, profession,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.580
etc.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.480
What if there are no variables like in the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.260
typical templates, those that are on

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.840
the Internet?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.500
No is no.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.140
Sometimes these variables are not

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.920
important and what they do is complicate us.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.720
And what we have is to incorporate

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.000
the things that are truly important

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.540
and representative of that customer

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.040
person that has gone to understand

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220
you better and sell you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.940
better.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.640
From each of your customer people

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.740
you should analyze, among many other

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.100
things, you have to analyze many

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.580
things, you already have the templates,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.680
and you have to make a lot of effort

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.220
in that, in understanding from

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.640
all the possible perspectives

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.340
that we have seen.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.240
Which channels are the right ones?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.840
What do you think of you and your competition?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.140
What is most valuable?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.680
All the previous ones, among others.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.130
How is the best way to understand

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.230
why they buy us, why they don’

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.610
t buy us, and generally understand

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.530
anything about our

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.650
customers?

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.690
Here I say that it doesn’t count

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.890
for the outcome because we haven’t

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.470
talked about it, but really the best

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.570
way to always understand your customers

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.670
is by asking them in interactions

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.010
as direct and personal

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.030
as possible.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.810
There are many people who love

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.890
surveys, but they almost

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.270
never get good insights,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.670
good conclusions.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.390
Sometimes they serve to validate things

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.870
you previously identified, but

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.590
nothing more.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.710
The Focus Groups, well, because they

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.870
are much better than surveys, but the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.190
best thing about it is to sit down

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.950
or have direct conversations with

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.350
customers.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080
Inditex’s strategy is segmentation,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.740
which is to target several

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.120
segments with proposals

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.380
adapted, in this case adapting

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.800
brands.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.520
What advice would you give someone

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.860
to compete in a niche?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.480
Remember that to compete in a niche

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.760
we have two options.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.820
One, focus on a very specific

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.140
customer person who has a particular

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.620
pain or whatever.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.640
And also what we can do is specialize

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.180
very much in a specific

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.420
product within a wider

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.740
range.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.300
Here I usually put the example

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.000
of Pepe Chuletón, who does

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.200
it is specialize a lot in a

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.680
particular product.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.520
Both answers are

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.140
good.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.920
What advice would you give someone

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
who is creating a new

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.660
value proposal?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.540
What you have to do is put a lot

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.220
of focus on the customer segment,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.940
on your ideal customers.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.120
You have to focus on them, understand

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.600
them very well and create a proposal

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.220
for them, for the people

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.420
who will buy you, who really

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.820
value your proposal.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.840
And many companies or many people

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.460
do what it does is unfocus

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.460
attempting to address several

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.800
customer segments and in many

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.320
cases to create a proposal for

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.720
segments or for customer

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.660
person that will not even buy you.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.980
We need to focus on early adopters.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.980
Are you more likely to close

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.480
a sale with a customer you are

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.780
looking for or are not looking for?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.340
When you are able to show the

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.480
need to a customer you were not

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.780
looking for, what happens is that

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.680
you have more chances of selling to him.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.760
Because it is not in the market

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.420
looking, it is not comparing you

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.880
with competitors and others.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.760
The customers who were not looking

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.880
for, how are they?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.960
They are not aware of having

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.780
need, they feel need but have

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.560
not been searched, they do not

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.680
know the existing offer.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.200
We can either find

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.700
or find the three parts.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.550
The key to success among those

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.970
who are looking for in the market

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.110
of people who are looking for

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.410
a proposal, which is it?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.550
You have a clear competitive

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.730
advantage because you have

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.330
to compete with others.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.510
Once you have your business

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.790
model, what is your target

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.690
market?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.030
This question is a bit difficult.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.510
The TAM does not depend on your business

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.510
model, the TAM depends on the

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.330
overall market.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.170
Your business model often does

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.070
what it does is condition

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.310
the SAM.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.590
Imagine, we talked about the total

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.030
market, you can’t access the

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.330
total market because you only

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.210
sell online.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.550
Your target market will

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.770
be online.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.580
And now we talk about SAM, which

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.040
is the market you’re going to reach,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.500
which you can get.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.540
In this case, what does it depend on?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.960
Why is Sam conditioned?

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.420
Because it is conditioned by the

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.960
plans you have, the money you have

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.280
to invest if you have a competitive

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.400
advantage, the position you have

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.740
today, of course, the starting point,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.400
the strength and the plans of your

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.440
competitors will also depend on

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.680
the others, what they will do.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.640
Those three answers are

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.340
correct.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.260
Which estimates or method do you

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.500
consider to be more real-life when

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.080
you estimate from bottom to

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.320
top, such as the Samsung TAM,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.980
or from top to bottom?

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.080
Well, because from top to bottom,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.540
if you do it well, it’s usually

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.420
closer to reality.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.260
It is harder to fall into the story

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.820
of the milk.
