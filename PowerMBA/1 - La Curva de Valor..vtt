WEBVTT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.040
Today we will start using one of

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.620
the most practical and useful

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.720
tools you will acquire throughout

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.720
the Power MBA.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.460
I personally love it and if I

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880
were to be put on the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.100
thesis that we had to use

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.240
only two tools, I think I

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.360
would focus on Business Model

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.200
Canvas and the value curves.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.760
Why do I like the curve of value

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.040
so much?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.700
Well, because I think it helps a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.480
lot to understand the competitive

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.560
curve, to understand what the rest

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.420
does, how you can differentiate,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420
to look for competitive advantages,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.260
and ultimately from

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.620
all that knowledge from

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.940
that base it is easier to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.040
innovate.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.560
It is also a tool that helps us

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.440
innovate, we will see it in the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.960
course of the blue ocean

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.660
strategy.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.700
What is this value curve?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.880
You have it on screen.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.960
The value curve is drawn on

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.300
a table called a strategic

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.060
table and is drawn on the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.460
value curves, your value

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.800
curve, a competitor's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.040
value curve, or a competitor'

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.760
s value curve, etc.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.540
This is the graphic structure, let's say.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.980
Now let's get into how the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.100
value curve is used.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.420
The first thing you need

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.240
to understand is to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.160
identify competitive

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.200
factors.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.140
There are people who call

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.140
it differently, there are people

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.760
who call it variables,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.480
well, anyway.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.560
Regardless of the name we use, it

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.940
is very important that you understand

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.000
what this is?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.760
Competitive factors, as I like

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.560
to call it, are the factors

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.840
around which competition in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.520
a sector revolves.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.040
That is, they are those factors

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.320
in which companies that are

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.580
within that sector invest to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.760
offer value to their customers.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.940
This is not well understood,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.260
but with an example.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.120
What are the competitive

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.940
factors of the automotive industry?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.500
What are car manufacturers

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.300
investing in to offer value?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.640
Well, what are the values that the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.680
customer perceives and by which

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.260
they decide to buy one or another?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.340
For example, I would say the price.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.760
The price is clear, the price

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.420
is always in all sectors, it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.180
is one of the main variables.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.680
Often it is decided by price.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.500
Another variable

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.420
is the engine.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.560
All manufacturers invest in providing

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.860
better performance in terms

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.740
of engine.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.240
Most importantly, the automotive

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.680
industry is the brand.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.340
The brand is important in this

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.020
case, especially in

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.120
the, say, higher segments.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
Design is very important.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760
They invest a lot in having beautiful things.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.940
The consumer is also very interested

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.980
in the design.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.040
Often decisions are

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.520
made based on design.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.160
Comfort, performance,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.300
etc. and safety can be.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.060
I would say that these

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.520
are the six main competitive

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.400
factors.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.720
I'll leave some, but I think you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.440
understand what we're talking about.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.860
Do we have them here?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.460
Competitive factors we have

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.360
to be able to identify them

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.920
quickly from any type of sector.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.040
And what we do is, in the strategic

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120
frame, in the axis of the X, in

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640
the horizontal axis, we put

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.220
all the competitive factors.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.940
Why is?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.200
Because from here, what we

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.920
will do is draw the curves

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.580
of value.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.420
As I said, we're going to draw the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.120
curve of value.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.980
You can draw the one

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.760
of your main competitor,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.060
yours, the industry

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.900
in general.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.400
In many cases, competitor

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.120
value curves can be grouped

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.300
into segments.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.260
In the different segments they

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.560
use, let's say they have opted

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.280
for similar strategies.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.360
The curve of value, I'll recalculate

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.860
it, right?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.200
The higher the value for the customer

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.760
and the more investment it requires.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.100
That's usually so, right?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520
And we'll do it again with the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.340
automotive industry.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.940
I usually choose this example because

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.200
I think it's a sector you understand

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.680
well.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.440
Let's start with the ultrasonic

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.540
car segment.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.920
We will draw the curve of value.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.580
How would it be?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.380
It would be something like that.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.560
The price is very high.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.500
Design invests a lot in design.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.900
He invests a lot in the engine.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.980
They invest a lot in brand.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.340
And then there are other factors

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.020
that for this type of car care

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.440
less,, such as comfort, safety

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.460
and others.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.200
What strategy?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.660
Now you know what the general

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.020
strategies are.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.540
What is the strategy in this case for Ferrari?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.580
It is clear that it is a niche

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.840
strategy in which your target audience

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.420
values those factors much more

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.980
than those in which they are positioned

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.620
above.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.520
And in this case, safety and comfort don'

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800
t value you so much because that's not

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.920
what you're looking for, right?

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, we're going to get

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.100
to the premium car.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.860
For example, we have the Germans

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.980
here, right?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.460
The three German marks.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.980
What is the value curve?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.520
It would be a little below

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.900
Ferrari in terms of price,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.640
design, engine, brand, etc.,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.180
but it's up in terms of comfort

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.400
and safety because they'

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.640
re cars that people use on

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.920
a daily basis, right?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.500
What is the strategy these companies

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.680
are following?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.260
Clearly it is a strategy, the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.360
generic strategy is a differentiation

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.800
strategy.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.540
We've seen it, they're aiming at the whole

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.460
market and also with a high value,

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.200
right?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.200
They do not compete in price.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.070
Finally, we go to the

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.770
most economical segment.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.190
We will draw the curve of value.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.330
I think it's easy to

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.910
draw, right?

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.690
This is below the curve

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.630
of premium cars.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.970
Obviously they are cheaper, but

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.230
invests less design, less value

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.330
the engine, etc.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.850
I think it's a very parallel

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.630
curve to the same trajectory

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.890
as premium cars,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.310
but a little lower.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.630
What are they playing?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.230
What generic strategy

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.150
can we position all these competitors,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.270
the economic cars?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.790
I think they compete in

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.550
cost.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.950
Indeed, competition, as we

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.390
saw earlier in another class,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.570
is cost-led.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.030
They are looking to be cost leaders.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.970
Well, since we already have

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.830
here, we have the value curves of

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.650
the three main segments in this industry.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.430
There could be more, right?

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.830
We've identified a group of competitors

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.890
that compete in a niche, we'

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.250
ve identified those who compete

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.030
in differentiation and we've identified

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.720
those who compete, those who

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.850
pretend to be cost leaders,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.330
right?

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.770
And finally, let's put a particular

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.890
example to illustrate how a

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.890
company can look or should,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.350
right?

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.570
You can, you should look for your unique value

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.350
proposition, your differentiation, right?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.610
by Volvo.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.770
Volvo has traditionally positioned

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.510
itself as having sold a great

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.950
value in terms of safety.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.090
Well, if we have the value curves

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.110
of the rest of the industry,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.410
we see how Volvo has drawn

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.270
a slightly different curve.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.010
And in the competitive factor,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.070
security, we are above the rest.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.110
It's always good to have a different

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.370
curve than the others, especially if

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.390
there's a segment of customers that values

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.410
that particular factor, right?

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.570
When we talk about differentiation,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.230
remember, when you need to look for

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.510
a competitive advantage by differentiation,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.070
it is convenient to do so, identify

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.590
a segment of customers

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.750
that values something that

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.050
you have different from

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.490
others.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.550
You're not competing

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.050
with others anymore, right?

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.050
Volvo is very clear.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.450
There are a lot of people who maybe,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.670
because many families don't value

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.770
it, or many car buyers don't value

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.390
safety so much and give more value

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.810
to design and choose another brand

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.670
maybe, right?

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.530
But that's, say, positioning,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.350
that's the strategy, that'

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.930
s the source where Volvo seeks

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.930
its competitive advantage.
