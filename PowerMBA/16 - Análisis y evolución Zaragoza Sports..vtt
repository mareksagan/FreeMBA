WEBVTT

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.570
Today we are with Javier Pérez, who

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.950
is one of the students of The Power

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.770
MBA, and as I said before, he is

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.150
one of the students advantageous

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.430
because he is 26 years old, he is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.990
an entrepreneur, in fact he has two

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.350
companies in operation, one of which

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.790
is the one we will analyze

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.590
today and another that has just

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.510
opened recently.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.790
The main game is Football

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.290
Indoor Zaragoza.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.310
We will do the following, first

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.170
we will quickly describe

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.290
the business model using the canvas

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.150
and then what we will do between

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.170
the two will be to do a little

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.950
analysis, an exercise of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.810
identifying strengths,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.750
weaknesses and some possible

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.990
evolution.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.170
Javier, thank you very much for being

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.030
with us.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.550
Nothing, you for the opportunity and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.570
for inviting me.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.170
If you tell us as quickly as

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.370
possible, what is Football

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.530
Indoor Zaragoza?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.350
Because it is a covered football

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.210
facility, we have two covered

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.030
football fields 5 and what

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.450
we also have is a cafe, dressing

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.450
area and private parking.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.730
and great.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.230
What do you offer to each

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.030
customer?

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.470
Because mainly they are the most

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.370
masculine profile, children who

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.550
come to celebrate their birthday

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.270
and train in our techno academy.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.150
And then we also have a group of

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.210
adults who come to play their

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.230
game, their pachanga, to train

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.090
with their team.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.010
In addition, we have a club of companies

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.050
that have a presence there in the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.970
installation and sponsor us with their

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.650
image, with their brand.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:05.430
We have kids training in an academy,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.690
adults renting the track to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.390
play with their friends and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.610
sports clubs.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.970
Football clubs also come

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.010
to train one day a week.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.130
And then finally you said you have

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.650
companies that are sponsors.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.550
How are the income flows?

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.410
How do you earn money?

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.910
Mostly what is the day-to-

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.710
day, what are rentals and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.310
the coffee box.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.510
Then the quarterly quotas

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.090
of the techno academy, birthday

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.790
is more punctual income,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.710
especially on weekends.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.490
Companies pay for advertising

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.110
annually.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.070
We have recurring income,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.450
we have the quotas that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.550
clubs and bonds pay, the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.450
revenues of sponsors too,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.830
the academy quotas and then

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.930
income say punctual.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.630
Of sales of services are the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.230
rental of the tracks and birthday

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.150
and also we add sales by

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.470
the coffee shop.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.550
The sales of the coffee shop, what

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.550
percentage of the total?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.210
You can make up 20% or

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.750
so.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.110
What are the key resources you need?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.650
The main thing is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.770
that the facility is wellined

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.710
and cared for.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.570
Sports equipment for ball,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.330
pocket, sports equipment

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.770
for the training sessions of

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.610
the academy and then the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.670
subject of the coffee shop suppliers.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.490
Because it has 1750 square meters,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.190
it is virtually a square of 40 per 40,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.670
a little more, and the truth is

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.330
that it is very large inside, very wide.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.210
Is it rented or you bought it?

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.450
It is currently rendered.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.870
What are your main costs?

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.740
Because more or less 50%

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.260
are virtually the payments, 30%

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.560
more or less will be the rental

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.620
of the installation, the space

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.740
and 20% of other supplier costs,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.620
fixed expenses such as light.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.190
Well, well, I think we got

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.290
a very quick idea of the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.970
business model.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.770
What I am going to do now is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.050
try to make a brief analysis of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.630
things that have been emerging from me.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.470
I think that with respect to strengths,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.510
there is a strength that is that

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.950
you have many different customer

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.150
segments, children, adults,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.310
clubs, companies, sponsors and

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.990
that reduces the risk because

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.650
you are more diverse.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.350
It allows you to grow, one

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.370
day to decide to grow in

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.270
the most profitable segments,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.010
etc.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.990
That is very well.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.450
In terms of income, more

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.350
of the same.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.450
It's very diverse, you have quotas,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.750
you have a punctual income, you have

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.370
a coffee shop and another point in

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.830
favor is that it's very recurrent.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.830
Most of your business is very recurring.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.590
I'm sure I ask you now, Javier,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.850
how much will you earn in the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:34.490
next six months?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.630
You would say it with little

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.490
margin of error.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.170
This is also true of costs,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.530
so you have a business with

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.750
very stable cash flows, very

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.770
easy to evaluate.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.030
What is very positive.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.890
Another positive point, and we are

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.450
talking now about the key resources,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.470
is the entry barrier you have

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.250
generated in Zaragoza.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.470
Because you have already made the investment,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.890
you have an installation that so

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.430
as we see in the photos is great.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.330
And I don't think there's anyone who

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.810
is now thinking about investing in Zaragoza

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.630
in something like yours and competing

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.210
with you.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.910
You have a very safe business.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.170
The truth is that yes.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.290
This type of facilities depend

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.830
mainly on urbanism and we

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.370
are located seven kilometers

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.750
south of Zaragoza, in

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.250
Cuarte de Huerva.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.470
It is a road facade ship.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.450
And the truth that as far as

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.670
reference at the national

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.390
level we have always been referents

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.710
that other facilities of this

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.790
mode that have wanted to open

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.130
have fixed on us.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.970
So as we said, it's very unlikely

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.430
that someone who is you will

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.630
venture to compete.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.770
And from the point of view of the weaknesses,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.390
to see how you perceive

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.630
it, I think there are several.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.570
One, which is related to the

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.990
customer segment and key

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.950
resources.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.730
The main target market

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.130
is Zaragoza.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.070
In principle yes.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.550
It is Zaragoza.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.010
That, well, because you will tell me that

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.470
clearly, it is that it has to be so

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.310
already, but it is true that it is a weakness.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.870
And look, I come to the head a project

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.970
in which I participated as a strategic

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.330
consultant several years ago, of

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.550
a business more or less similar to

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.770
yours, that was the Academy of Tennis

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.970
of Sánchez Casal, which is Emilio

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.050
Sánchez Dicario and Casal,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.910
who was his companion

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.530
when they played.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.050
And they turned a business, say,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.430
in principle local, like a tennis

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.670
academy, into an international

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.670
college.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.410
And they went from billing, like

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.850
the rest of the Academies, 300,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.030
000 euros, to billing many millions

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.650
of euros.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.970
Every child paid 60,000 euros or something,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.810
I don't know.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.330
They were able, in this case,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.650
to, despite relying on a resource

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.490
that limited them to a very

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.470
close customer segment,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.430
expand their target market.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.090
And the other weakness is a bit

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.810
related, is that the key resource,

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.430
which is the installation, depend

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.730
a lot on an installation, because

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.330
it limits your growth.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.470
You are not scalable, because

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.330
if you want to grow in, I

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.950
don't know, in Pamplona, you have

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.430
to re-invest in Pamplona, etc.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.050
So tell us a little about how

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.030
you are, because of course, everyone

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.590
has growth in their head.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.430
How did you put this into

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.130
question?

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.590
Man, we have even come to think

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.570
of opening a center of these

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.670
in another city, especially in

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.690
northern Spain, which is not much.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.830
And, well, the other option

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.510
is to expand the installation

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.990
in the spaces around ships that

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.850
are available.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.270
Well, always taking advantage of some

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.970
opportunity and being able to open,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.690
then, even another football field

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.090
or two paddle tracks to complement

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.610
the installation a little more.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.530
Yes, but by what you say, your

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.890
growth approach is always matched

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.570
by a greater investment, which

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.990
in principle I imagine is

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.970
to reform the space,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.550
right?

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.770
And above all, of course.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.370
In principle, as a business model,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.550
it is a very local business, it does

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.790
not cease to be a space, a establishment.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:27.110
And, well, because that is a limiting

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.690
to the time of being able to

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.690
scale this business.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.290
A limit, you said well.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.010
Well, this happens in a lot

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.670
of, in all business models, that

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.830
you depend on a specific

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.050
location, that really

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.430
your competitive advantage

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.050
is that.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.390
Your competitive advantage

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.050
is the resource you have.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.390
And, well, look, already to finish,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.010
I will comment on some case of people

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.050
who have been able to innovate as

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.690
regards this.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.330
And one, you already know it,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.070
because Richie, the CEO of Vintae,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.230
who we analyzed the case a few

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.650
classes ago, he that he surpassed,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.650
let's say, is in the cave

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.950
sector, as he told us, people,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.750
cellars when they grow, let's say

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.870
they acquire the real estate,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.090
the cellar in property,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.670
right?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.090
And they have made it to establish

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.890
strategic alliances with cellars,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.870
with many cellars across

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.630
Spain.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.970
It has allowed them to grow much

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.490
more than their competition.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.210
Or, for example, I think of

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.570
sectors also of local business,

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.890
such as hairdressers or gyms,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.470
which have emerged platforms

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.830
like Bookme or Jim Forless

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.750
or whatever connect customers

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.510
with this type of business.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.810
So these people have grown without

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.810
having to invest in the resource.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.350
It's true that it's another business,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.350
it's another business, but well,

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.510
it's just ideas that come up to me.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.950
Do you think there is a possibility

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.830
of this type?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.640
Man, breaking out this business

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.320
model is complicated.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.860
Usually in each city they usually

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.660
ride it their own way because

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.920
they are the ones who know

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.180
it best.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.860
And well, because, as well

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.580
as ideas, I think, we handle

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.500
mostly a platform, a

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.860
reservation system, develop

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.160
something more specific for

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.340
this type of facilities at

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.780
the national, international

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.480
level or whatever could be a

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.220
good way because after all

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.960
these facilities require

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.640
and need those reservation

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.860
systems to manage that

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.180
space and those services.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.640
I think someone has advanced

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.020
you because there is another

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.200
of our collaborators you'll know

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.220
who is launching a very fat

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.840
company with something similar.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.260
We need to see if it is competitive

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.580
or not.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.380
Effectively what you said, I don't

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.740
know, likewise it's possible that

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.680
you franchise because there are a

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.160
lot of people who probably have

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.440
ships or spaces of these missed across

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.160
Spain, but they't go to mount

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.400
something like yours because

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.660
they don't have any idea or

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.180
how to start.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.780
If you give it key in hand, you

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.060
may give the solution to many

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.960
people who have the property.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.560
That you want to exploit that space

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.820
in some way, so it's safe

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.600
and profitable.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.360
What would happen is that over time

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.760
it would depend very little on you

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.320
and you would have a problem in

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.060
that sense, but I'm convinced that

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.820
by launching it you could help.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.480
There are thousands of people in

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.020
Spain who have ships, similar to

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.480
those you are, but without

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.020
conditioning, that would be willing.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.980
If any of the students

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.780
have any ideas to evolve

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.080
this business model, I

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.000
imagine it will be very

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.660
welcome.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.640
And if you, Javier, do some of

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.540
it too, I would thank you for telling

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.300
us so that it will be enriching

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.260
for everyone.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.620
of course.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.500
Nothing but to congratulate

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.520
you once again for the business

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.620
you have and thank you for

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.440
sharing it with us.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.800
for you the opportunity.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.820
Thank you very much, Javier.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.500
Until then.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.420
Until then.
