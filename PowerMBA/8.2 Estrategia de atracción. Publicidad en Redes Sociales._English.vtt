00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.820
The last thing I’m going to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.220
do is share 5 trends we’re observing

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.700
in Social Media Advertising.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.080
The video is growing a lot.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.440
Video is growing on the Internet.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.920
Almost all the content that is consumed

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.060
today is audiovisual.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.160
Proof of this are Instagram stories

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
or that all platforms

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.760
are developing new technology

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
to encourage the use of

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.100
video.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.640
80% of marketers use video

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.420
in their campaigns.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.740
Two of influencers.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.000
Attracting traffic through

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.480
influencers is not the same

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.940
as making paid ads

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.180
on social media.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.680
You should be aware that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680
there are many synergies.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.060


00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.620
Why is?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.160
Because influencers are ultimately

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
their audiences within social

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.920
media.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.080
Thus, these strategies

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.720
should be complementary.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.060
Three, these platforms or these

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.400
channels are maturing in some cases.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.840
What do I mean by this?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.300
For a few years, there were

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.520
very few people who

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
used Facebook as a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.820
advertising tool.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.520
And what happened was that there

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680
were companies that benefited from that.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.900
They could then capture or generate

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.820
traffic at very low costs.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.760
Hawkers, for example, was a very

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.400
pioneer in the use of Facebook.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.500
Today, a large majority

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.300
of companies are using Facebook.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.900
And this grows more every day.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.400
I take Facebook as an example.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.680
But in the end, the platforms work

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.460
like that.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.420
This is supply and demand.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580
As new advertisers mature

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.960
or enter, in principle, the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.320
costs will rise until

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080
a time when they will

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.640
stabilize, balance

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.100
so that people will find

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.640
it profitable.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.200
Four, the mobile is growing.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.160
This is generally on the internet.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.040
You simply have to take it into account.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.180
If you have to think that a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.340
growing percentage of the audience

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.020
you impact will see it on

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.200
the mobile.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.500
So, well, because you may

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.760
have to adjust a little bit

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.580
the format, the type of video, etc.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.660
Because consumption is not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.060
exactly the same when you are on a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.760
computer as when you are on your mobile.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.880
The fifth point is called the algorithm.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.260
What do I mean by this?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.500
All platforms, but not only

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.920
in social networks, but Google,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.560
which has been the great

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.940
pioneer, are concerned,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.800
not concerned, but encourage

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.020
that you get good content,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.880
quality, you like, etc.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.360
And what is this due to?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.900
This is due to saturation.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.680
There are more and more advertisers,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.820
more and more companies that want

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.740
to impact you.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.560
And the social network, like Facebook,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.580
what it wants is that you get quality

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.360
content, because that results

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880
in the benefit of everyone.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.340
So, these algorithms do what they

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.780
do is prioritize, prioritize

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.040
the best content, the best

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.060
companies, etc.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.100
And in the end, how do they do it?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.600
I will not go into this now, but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.840
in different ways.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.140
But if your ads, many people like,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.360
well, because they will

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.260
be encouraged, will have lower

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.400
costs, etc.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.560
And all the other way if a lot of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.820
people, for example, tell you that they

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.580
spam and so on.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.120
The issue, what we have to keep

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.020
in mind, is that algorithms

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.340
are increasingly weighing and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.720
that the companies that we advertise

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.080
on social media, we have to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.720
take this into account, because

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.100
there is a certain contingent,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.660
you depend on the platform.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.080
Therefore, the ideal thing

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.460
is to diversify as much as possible,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.960
because if you depend on a platform

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.180
and that platform in one that is,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.360
it is not that it penalizes you in

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.640
particular, but it changes the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.460
rules, well, and your traffic

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.980
decreases a lot, because you can

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.680
have a problem.
