WEBVTT

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.760
How will we solve it?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.280
We will solve this by creating a story.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.960
And why?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.580
Basically because it is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.080
ultra-proven that if stories

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.440
catch us, stories are easy

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.620
to follow, stories are

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.800
easy to remember.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.460
So, all those messages we will

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.720
give them a thread, we will give

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.300
them a script through a story.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.380
We will use the structure that Donald

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.780
Miller proposes, which you have

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.500
on screen, has seven steps.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.780
He has called it the model or framework

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440
of the seven steps of StoryBrand.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.240
This really wasn't invented

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.860
by him.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.320
These seven steps are the seven

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.760
steps that almost every movie,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060
almost every book, etc. follow.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.480
Why is?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.140
Because it is proven that when

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.280
a story has these components,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.220
these phases, it clings us.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.620
We want to get to the end.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.500
This is what we will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.720
do in our company's communications.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.260


00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.300
What we have to do is create a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.560
story in which the customer is

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.340
at the center and we are helping

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.100
him to visualize how we will

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.320
help him, how we will solve

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.780
his problems.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.020
Let's quickly see what stages

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780
or components every story

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.980
has to have.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.900
You have to have a protagonist.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.380
Let's think of a movie.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.060
Every film has a protagonist.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.620
The protagonist is not your brand,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.320
the protagonist is your customer.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.320
The actor has some problems.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.520
The problem is the hook.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.400
You think of a movie.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.760
If there were no problems, we'

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.900
t be watching the movie.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.440
Think of an action movie.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.000
A problem quickly arises.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.260
There must be a guide.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.220
The protagonist meets something

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.600
or someone who helps him, which

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240
in this case you will be.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.880
Your brand should be the guide that

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.140
helps solve those problems.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.580
In the movies, it's usually

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.740
someone else, etc.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.280
This guide is to define a plan

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.260
of action.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.680
Things don't change from night to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.940
morning.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.560
You always have to take

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.620
a few steps to make things

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.680
change.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.480
The plan of action will be

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.380
determined by us.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.720
These are the steps that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.000
the customer will ask for.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.920
This action usually ends

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.520
in a call to action.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.020
That is, the guide what he does is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.060
ask the client, demand him a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000
certain commitment to do something about it.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.980
And really stories matter to us

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.480
or interest us because there is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.920
something at stake and we go to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.760
the last two parts.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.340
That is, depending on whether

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.600
things are going wrong,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.960
in a movie it may be, what is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.980
at stake in an action movie?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.300
The protagonist dies his

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.700
family, exploits the bomb,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.280
ends up in a war, etc.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.560
The conflict is resolved, etc.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.120
I think you already understand where I am going.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.640
And we have to be able to visualize

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.440
our client, the protagonist,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560
the hero of the story who

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.360
is what he will get, what

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.380
the benefit he will get or

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.220
what failures or risks he

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.020
will avoid if he buys

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.740
our product.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.660
You already know what the structure is.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.820
Now, let's go to the practical part.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.260
How will we apply this?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.000
What we will do is use the framework,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.300
the model, the Story Brand

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.560
canvas that you will be able

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.140
to download and what we

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.500
will do is apply our company

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.760
and fill it.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.260
It can be filled directly in the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.000
online ornator.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.320
We have to do that analysis of

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.760
going point by point, analyzing

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.120
each of the blogs, how it affects

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.480
us, how to improve it, etc.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760
Why do I love models?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.400
Because it helps you think.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.740
They help you not to have

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.800
to face a white garlic.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.420
If you had now to write all the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.180
messages on the web, all the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.180
ads, etc., the texts with a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.980
lot of creativity and also you

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.100
often make many mistakes

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.320
because things don't make

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.860
sense, etc.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.600
This will help us to have a guide

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.060
through which to filter absolutely

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.160
all the messages that we will

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.720
incorporate into the different

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.280
supports, such as web,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.760
ads, emails, pdf, etc.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.160
But first we need to do this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.060
exercise.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.440
We have to define what history is.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.480
We have to work well.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.300
It is something I recommend.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.240
This is something we will

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.280
learn in the next classes.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.400
And once we have very clear what

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.380
is the history of our company,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.720
the protagonist, what is what

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.680
he wants, what are the problems

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.680
we will help him solve, how we

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.440
will position us as someone

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.580
who can help him, what we will

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.260
ask him, what are the next steps,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.160
how we will transmit that trust

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.400
and make him see how we will

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.720
help him, how he will change

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.820
his life, what is in play,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.040
what happens if you buy

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.700
us, what happens if

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.920
you don't buy us.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.200
When we have all this clear,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.320
we will improve the website

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.680
a lot, we will improve all

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.660
the ads you make and every time

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.540
you have to write a copy,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.500
a text that goes to a customer,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.640
has to pass, has to be

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.840
filtered by this story.
