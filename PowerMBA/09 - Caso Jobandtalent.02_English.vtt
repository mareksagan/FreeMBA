00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.080
Then, well, because we have lived many

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.300
stages, we have raised a lot of

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.740
funding and two years ago, because

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.700
we had to make some decisions of the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.440
era, hear, we have raised a lot

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.480
of capital, we continue to push this

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.880
model that we no longer see it scalable

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.740
or we make the decision

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.060
to change it.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.480
And that was when we turned around

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.580
and what we did was, having all

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.200
the experience of capturing candidates,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.020
we decided to transform them into

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.760
a temporary work company but

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.860
much more digitized.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.880
That is, just like low-cost

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.160
mobile operators, because

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.360
they work much more with

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.860
technology or have much more

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.410
optimized processes, why

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.490
not put the same low-cost

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.310
model, like airlines, which

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.630
are low-cost?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.890
If you do so with the employment

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.770
sector, the temporary employment

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.450
sector, as there are temporary

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.610
work companies, either in

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.610
Randstad, ADECO, Manpower,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.010
which have very high structural

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.130
costs and quite rudimentary

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.830
processes, why not digitize

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.690
all those processes?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.930
And in a way we optimize much

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.810
more the costs to create the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.970
low cost of staffing, of hiring.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.970
What do you offer to the user who is looking

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.030
for a job?

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.290
What do you offer to the company

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.070
that is looking for a job?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.030
How can you reach them?

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.730
What is the capture model of

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.550
each of them?

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.970
Tell us a little more about who you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.590
are paying for?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.730
Well look, there the candidate or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.490
employee what they are looking for

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.090
is work, then that employee

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910
or that candidate will always

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.290
be trying to look through all

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.370
the sources that they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.990
can any type of job.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.030
And I Pantalen in that case is one more,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.490
in that sense we can not say that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.910
we offer something super special,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.990
it is true that we move a lot of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.850
employment, but it also moves a lot

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.470
of employment and many companies,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.570
since the traditional ones.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.250
So what we do is also think, apart

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.270
from taking care of that candidate,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.650
just like other temporary work

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.650
companies can do, what things

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.570
we can do to him Because basically

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.210
there are three things we

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.470
call volume, speed

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.370
and quality.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.730
In the end, we were born

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.550
in a digital world where

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.250
for us, capturing candidates

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.850
is much easier than it

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.810
can be for a traditional one.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.250
A traditional one for you to get

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.710
an idea has offices across Spain

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.410
or around the world where people

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.750
go and ask if they can

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.430
help them find employment.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.910
We do not have structural costs,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.670
we do not have offices and directly

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.470
what we do is communicate through

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.070
the internet, hear we have

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.090
these job offers with these companies,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.750
we demand these positions,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.470
if you are interested

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.810
let us know.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.950
Then from there we capture candidates

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.730
every day at very high levels

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610
in terms of volume and the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.870
part of those candidates

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.970
we have solution.
