00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.240
As you already know, capitalizing

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.800
is about moving cash flows, charges,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.000
payments, etc., to a future

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.720
moment.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.260
It allows us to calculate future value.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.500
Well, what we’re going to do is deepen

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
into the two types of capitalization,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
which is simple or composite

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.120
capitalization, which is the same

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.860
as talking about simple interest

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.020
or applying a composite

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.800
interest.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.020
And we will do it by putting ourselves

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.880
in a hypothetical case, because it will

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.960
help us to understand it better.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.780
We will think that we are making

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.620
an investment of one million euros

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.360
today, that is, the present value

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.620
is one million euros.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.720
We think that the interest rate

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.560
is 10% and the N, or the number

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.140
of periods, we will fix

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.940
it at 3.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.000
In this case, we want to calculate

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.700
the final value of our

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.340
investment.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.760
But we’ll do it using simple

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.420
capitalization and using composite

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000
capitalization to see

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.360
what happens.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.420
Let’s start with simple capitalization.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840
In order to understand the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.860
simple capitalization, the interest

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.500
rate or interest is calculated,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.880
it is always generated

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.100
on the initial capital, in

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.900
our case on the million euros.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.700
What is what happens?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.320
As we invested one million euros, the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.980
first year we generate 100,000 euros

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.820
of interest, the second year

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.300
another 100,000 and the third

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700
year another 100,000.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
The final value of our investment

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.280
is 1.3, 1.300.000 euros.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.460
It is very easy.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.020
If you see it in the formula, it’

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.740
s just as easy.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.260
The future value in this case is

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.480
equal to the present value, which

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.440
is one million euros as we have

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.400
seen, by 1, we multiply it by

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.160
a capitalization factor.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.820
In this case, the capitalization

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.360
factor is equal to 1 plus the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.900
interest rate, i.e. 1 to 1,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.080
by the number of periods.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
Every year we are generating 100,000

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.020
euros, multiplying it by 3, at

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.580
the end we add it to the present

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.660
value and we have the final value.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.300
explained in another way.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.340
This is simple capitalization.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.960
It is very simple.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.280
Now we go to the composite capitalization.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.880
The difference between compound capitalization

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.160
and simple capitalization

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.740
is that we will apply the interest

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.260
rate.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.360
Remember, in the simple we always

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.040
applied the interest rate on

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.920
the million euros, on the initial

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.520
capital.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400
We will not do it this way here.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.020
Look how we will do it.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.700
We have a million euros and we will calculate

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.980
what the final value is in the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.760
first year.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.420
It is 1.1, and we have applied the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.240
interest rate.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.920
This year, from year 1 to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.400
year 2, interest is generated

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.780
again.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.140
But we will not apply interest

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.200
on the million euros, but on

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.720
the million euros plus the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.020
interest of the venges until

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.600
then.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.480
We will multiply 1.1, in this case

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.840
by 1.1 again and the final value

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.120
in year 2 is 1.21.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.380
If we go to the year 3, we

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.780
have to multiply it by 1.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280
And at the end, look, the final value comes

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.540
out to us 1.46, which is much higher

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.960
than 1.3 that we saw in

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.780
simple capitalization.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.080
It is logical because you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.540
are calculating, you are applying

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.840
interest every time on a larger

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.660
amount, it is accumulating, it is

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.680
exponential.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.940
In the formula, what we can

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.700
do is compare the formulas.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.080
The formula, if we talk about

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.640
simple capitalization, the future

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.780
value is equal to the present

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.300
value, which in this case was one

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.040
million euros, multiplied by a capitalization

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.360
factor that is 1 plus the interest

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.980
rate by the number

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.240
of periods.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.140
If we go to composite capitalization,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.320
the difference is that this capitalization

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.520
factor will not be multiplied

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.860
by the number of periods, but

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.660
will be elevated to the number

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.440
of periods.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.280
Why is?

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.540
As we were seeing,

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.240
it is accumulating.
