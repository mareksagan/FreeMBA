WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.820
Alfonso, we will analyze

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.920
the vanguard growth strategy

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.100
and we will relate it to

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.380
things we have learned.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.240
For example, vertical integration

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.600
forward or backwards, entering

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.020
your supply chain, in

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.620
your suppliers or in

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.200
your customers.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.700
And we will analyze it with the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.940
strategy of Igor Ansov, with the

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.020
matrix, forgiveness, in which

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.400
we can basically grow by penetrating

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.740
the market, in the current market,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.340
or product development in our

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.100
current market or go to expansion,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
which would be market development,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.640
or diversification, which

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.680
I think in this case does

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.160
not apply.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.880
Tell us this in a historical way.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.720
How did you do it?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.720
What are the main milestones you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.060
have given?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.540
Ok, then see, when we created

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.520
Global, which is vanguard, when

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.960
we created vanguard the initial

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.820
concept was, well, we are two partners,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060
we do not have a lot of resources,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.840
how we started to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.380
create a distribution company.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.340
A company that can bill without

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.560
having to resort to large investments.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.820
In fact, the investments we

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.340
have created this company have

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.220
been quite small.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.240
And well, the first thing was,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.080
because we had a structure, a network

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.680
of developing brands in which

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.760
we would then be able to make

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.580
them known nationally and then

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.340
do something similar internationally,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.240
either to us or through

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.440
importers.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.000
Well, this is the master plan,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.540
but the first step was to enter the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.400
supply chain, enter the distribution,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.300
because in addition you need it,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.420
it is less capital-intensive

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.680
than if you have to enter the,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.840
in the previous link, which

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.100
is the creation of the brand.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.080
Effectively, then, well, what we did

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.160
was create a distributor,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.620
which we already had experience

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.180
in the past, that was dedicated

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.480
to importing products and also

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.700
we took that moment to make a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.640
company that already had face

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.040
and eyes of what we wanted

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.560
to be.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.880
That is, not any company, but already

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.220
give it a similar look to what we

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.320
wanted to be in the future, because

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.840
if not then change is very difficult.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.060
Then, we said, well, let's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.320
start with the distribution, let's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.980
say that in the value chain you would

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.200
be, thus, closer to the end,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.760
closer to the end, and we created

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.680
an import company.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.200
We started looking for brands that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.060
seemed to be different and that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.880
could also create that blue ocean

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.960
or that differentiation, and we

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.020
focused on that type.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.300
We created a catalog of products

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.240
that allowed us to invoice, which

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.080
is fundamental to start having

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.060
some cash flows and a payment of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.260
what is the staff, having a minimum

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.240
structure, having a marketing person,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.120
having sellers on the street,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.580
that, when you create a company,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.960
because they are usually

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.460
the highest costs.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.240
At the end of the day, you get the money and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.560
if you don't succeed it's a well without a bottom.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.320
Once we had success in that creation

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.980
of, that is, on that basis of a distribution

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.200
company and that we already had,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.280
say, a DNA, a way of selling ourselves,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000
a way of being, a way of working

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.260
the trade, what we decided

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.020
was to integrate vertically

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.280
towards, that is, well, because

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280
now is the time to be a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.100
manufacturer, to be a brand

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.100
owner.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.180
This, obviously, was complicated

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.760
because doing it alone also means

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.380
a big investment and we always looked

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.160
for partners or partners who

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.060
were already manufacturing, so

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.280
that we were either the 100% owners

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680
of the brand and they made us

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.020
a makeup, or we were partners

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.340
at 50% or in different percentages,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.820
but they only manufactured

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.500
and we were already in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.700
charge of the development

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.240
of the brand and the internalization

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.140
of the product.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.780


00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.380
This was a bit of the strategy, it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.620
worked, we found our first partner

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.840
that was with Jimare, with Osiro,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.080
and from there we have been developing

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.220
different partnerships

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.600
with different producers

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.880
in all the products we have

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.000
generated.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.720
We have not wanted to fully

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.880
integrate in manufacturing, that

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.800
is, focus on what you do well, which

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.680
is also another strategy that I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.860
imagine you will see in the master,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.920
dedicate yourself to your core to focus

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.040
on your core and give it and give

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.180
it penetration and what does not

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.820
add value to the company that others

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.220
do, but in this case...

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.020
You are great at branding, in

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.180
that you are unique, so why

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.200
are you going to wear off the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.540
opportunity cost that has to have

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.240
all that in the previous slopes

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.660
of the supply chain

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.660
when there are people who

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.380
do it greatly.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.440
exactly to.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440
There is the whole sense of the world.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.120
Exactly, we partner through

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.540
different ways creating companies,

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.460
contracts that allow us to take

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.240
advantage of that know-how that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.380
exists and that does not really

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.300
bring a differential value

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.560
in creating a distillery

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.720
to a Lambique.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.020
In fact, I think that many companies

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.940
make the mistake of starting their

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.420
company there, when they have

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.620
already put a lot of money

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.680
and don't even have sales,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.660
because they are drowned.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.300
So, let's say that initial concept

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.780
of market penetration, we started

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.340
creating it with brands that

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.680
were not ours, but allows you

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.300
to generate a significant

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.160
sales volume.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.500
Then we go to what is product

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.960
development, that is, new

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.200
products in existing markets.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.900
Then, that allows us to start

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.060
working in our market, which

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.760
was Spanish.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.320
We already have a customer base,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.280
we incorporate new products and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.160
allow us to move to the next level.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.040
their own marks.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.820
their own marks.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.200
So, that we started to generate

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.120
more sales of own brands and

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.060
reduce third-party brands.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.000
We maintain verticality, we

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.180
continue to carry third-party

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.420
brands that help us continue to

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.280
generate an interesting invoice.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.840
There is tension there.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120
And tensions are generated.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.480
Indeed, we had a clear example

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.780
of a Geneva brand we were

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.820
carrying at the time and because

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.980
the success we had with

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.220
Jim Mare led us to break

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.620
relationships.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.940
This has happened to

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.700
many companies.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.060
Amazon has happened to him, because

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.820
Amazon became Amazon Publishing,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.620
it's called.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.260
It was once an e-commerce

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.440
book and became an editorial.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.640
So, of course, with the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.160
publishers, Spotify has happened

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.600
to the producers, which happens

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.480
to everyone.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.700
You will be competing with

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.860
your former partners.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.720
Actually, this has actually

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.420
happened.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.960
And then what has led us is to distribute

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.720
brands where there is no

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.380
tension.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.380
Look for brands that complement each other

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.280
or that add value.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.240
These are the two things we

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.860
started with.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.020
And then later already, and this was

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.500
very followed, once we have already

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.380
integrated vertically and started

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.460
with product development,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.240
we have started to develop markets.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.540
It's the part of how I get bigger

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.980
with markets that I'm not, where

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.380
I'm not.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.000
And then there began internationalization

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.880
and say, well, then come,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.000
we're going to markets.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.700
We choose the most complex markets.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.120
We didn't go like many companies

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.580
do, well, because where to buy me.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.320
The markets that must be won.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.680
We went to England, we went

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.460
to Germany, we didn't go to Belgium.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.960
Markets are complex and difficult

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.360
to enter, but we would rather put

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.200
all the focus and all the energy where

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.780
it would cost more to introduce

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.660
brands.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.940
This also allowed us to

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.620
gain a brand image.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.500
Have a stronger brand.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.820
If you are successful

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.780
in England, it is unfortunate,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.980
but it is not the same as being successful

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.200
in Zimbabwe.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.880
The people of Zimbabwe do not

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.300
follow it, but they often go

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.320
to England.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.080
They are trending and you see what is happening.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.700
What is happening in England

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.120
also has an effect of escalating

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.840
the rest of the market.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.200
If you allow it when you are going

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.600
to open a new market, it will be easier

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.180
or even open up on its own.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.720
Let them call you and tell you, I've

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.920
seen this brand in London or I've

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.660
seen it in New York.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.340
I would like to bring this

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.320
product to Australia.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.340
In fact, it happened to us.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.020
Australia opened up because

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.340
they called us because they

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.960
had seen the product in England.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.260
So, let's say that would be, say,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.220
the last that is what diversification

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.320
is, because a strategy a little

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.760
harder, more complicated

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.220
than as you already know, has

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.120
more risk.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.680
It is not a strategy that we

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.840
do not consider.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.840
In fact, diversification, well,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.060
we have made some extension

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.780
of line and such, that is not

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.960
really a diversification, but

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.820
we do leave open the possibilities

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.060
because, well, we like as

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.820
a company to be very fresh

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.040
and be close to trends and

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.720
opportunities.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.100
And I think that now there is a

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.020
brutal moment in developments of new

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.220
ideas at the technological level, at

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.660
the level of everything that are

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.800
apps, value to the same accounts

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.660
that we serve, with which there is

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.880
a possibility to offer other

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.920
products to those same customers,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.640
but different that do not have to

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.580
do with our business.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.020
In fact, we encourage people

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.240
working in the company to think

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.420
about, hear, I can sell trips

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.080
or I can sell experiences,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.640
I can sell distillery visits,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.020
I can sell POS, I can sell another

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.580
set of things than the liquid

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.080
served in a bottle or served

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.780
in a glass, and I think that'

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.240
s also important for

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.600
the future, having that

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.240
door open.
