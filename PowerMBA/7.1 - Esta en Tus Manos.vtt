00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.420
There is a mindset or a mentality, it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.060
is usually said that mindset although

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.280
it may seem a bit orterous when it

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.680
is said in English, which usually

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.340
differentiates people who are successful

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.540
from who do not, I think it has

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.960
to do with Power Launch Formula

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.980
and that is why we share it.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.520
We could summarize it like this.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.780
What we have to assimilate

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.960
is that we, each of us, are

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.420
the only ones responsible

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.480
for both our future situation

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.140
and that we our goals.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.020
What does that mean?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.320
That there are no excuses, that it does

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.600
not depend on anyone else, that it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.720
only depends on us and that it is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.380
in our hands to those goals.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.920
That means assimilating that our current

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.480
situation depends on decisions

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.840
we have made in the past, it depends

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.820
on our attitude, it does

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520
not depend on anyone else.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.660
Why do we consider this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.440
important?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.060
Because when you change the chip,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.740
when you become truly responsible

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.840
for everything that happens

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.000
to you, it is like you activate, you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.320
start, you get a little bit of the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960
batteries, because you realize that

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.000
this only depends on me and I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.720
will not be complaining and what

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.860
I will do is everything possible

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.560
to my goals whatever they

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.160
are.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.700
We have said that each of

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.200
us is responsible for our

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.240
current situation.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.580
Our current situation depends on or

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.200
is a consequence of decisions we

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.140
have made in the past.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.520
For example, if you have a job you don't

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.920
like, where you feel like you're not

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.460
giving everything you're carrying

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.040
in, or that doesn't fill you, who's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.360
to blame for that?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.760
It is just your fault, right?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.280
Or if you dream of having more freedom

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.160
than you have now.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.800
All this is the result of decisions

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.160
you have made before, it is the result

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.580
of nothing else, don't blame your

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.960
boss or the world or anything else.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.180
Or if you have a company that doesn't

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.620
grow and then you're angry because

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.120
at the end it's self-employment,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.000
the company doesn't grow,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.240
you work a lot, you don't blame

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.680
the crisis, the market, or anyone.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.320
It is the fault of not having innovated

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.280
enough, it is the fault of not taking

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.560
the right steps because there are

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.880
others who have done so and vice

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.420
versa as well.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.100
If you are happy with your current

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.180
situation, with your company, if

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960
you are happy, it will be partly because

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.760
you have a good attitude and partly

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.800
because you have made good

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.940
decisions that have brought

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.100
you the situation to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.080
a situation you like.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500
That is the current situation that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.680
is the fruit of the past, but the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.720
most important thing is that we

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.520
take responsibility for everything

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.860
that will happen from now on.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.060
This is very good with Power

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.220
Lounge Formula, why?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.320
Because we talked about that we

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.900
have desires, dreams, goals

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.540
that we want to materialize,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.060
that in this case it is to launch

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460
innovative products, services,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.180
business models and that will

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.420
have an impact on our lives,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.220
on our professional career.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100
We need to be very clear about

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.140
what those goals are.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.480
We encourage you to ask yourself

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000
what my goals are,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.280
what my vision is, where

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.040
I want to get.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.740
And the next thing you have

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.820
to do is be aware that it is

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.600
in your hand to it and that it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240
is only your responsibility.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.420
If within three, five years you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.100
have reached the deadline you have

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.980
set, it will be your merit.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.440
And if you didn't it, it will also

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.700
be the consequence that you didn't

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.000
do what you should have done.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.380
So to finish, you are the only one

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.900
responsible for the current situation

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.720
and the future situation to get the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.300
most of Power Lounge Formula and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.100
to create the circumstances,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.400
as we saw before, so that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.520
united to knowledge,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.540
you end up reaching those

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.000
dreams, those goals.
