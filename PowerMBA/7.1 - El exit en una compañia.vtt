00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.460
I have a question that I have,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.060
which is a curiosity.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.860
In general, after the exit, as you

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.420
have told me, in almost every occasion

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.060
the founders, entrepreneurs

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.180
have to be a few years in the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.680
company, and it is your current

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.000
case.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.500
What is done afterwards?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.200
We are talking about young people

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.940
who have earned money, etc.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.760
In your experience and in the people

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.380
around you, similar cases, what

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.400
is usually done?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.420
Well, I think entrepreneurs

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.100
are like race, a special

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500
race, so I think the real

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.960
entrepreneur can't normally

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.920
be on a beach taking

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.800
the sun.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.400
That Miguel Vicente told us, I think after

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.920
the purchase of the Edgebone or something

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.460
like that, he wanted to take

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.700
a month of vacation and went

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.440
back to the week.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.720
Yes, that happens.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.380
That depends, it is very personal

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.040
and depends on the vital goal of each

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.480
and the personal situation of each,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.500
because maybe one wants to spend

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.080
more time with his family and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.600
his children, wants to travel and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880
has the opportunity to do so.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800
I see that it usually happens that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.220
maybe they take a while to disconnect,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.960
because they have invested a lot

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.980
of energy and a little to decompress,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.740
but then they come back with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.580
the desire to start sometimes

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.700
a new project.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.700
And also what happens is that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.480
they also usually invest as Business

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.620
Angels, a little is give back,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.060
return to society what you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.100
have given.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.180
So, if you have gone well, then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.060
how can I return some of the good

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.940
that has gone to me and help

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.280
other entrepreneurs and continue

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.320
to create, not directly,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.900
but also help other

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.480
companies.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.100
That can be contributing capital

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.960
because you may invest or advice,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.360
mentoring.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, there are usually two figures,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.600
one that turns a lot of their

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.760
time into another project and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.200
others that what they do is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.800
create a backdrop or vehicle.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.400


00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.400
Sometimes with their confundator and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.720
other times not, in which they invest

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800
as Business Angels or as a small

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.220
venture capital in different

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.880
entrepreneurial projects

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.820
it is more expensive, because

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.960
the experience allows you to add

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.220
a lot of value to those

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.600
younger people projects, etc.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.320
And, in the end, do you think

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.680
the entrepreneur usually has

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.320
this goal?

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.240
What do you think is the main engine

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.900
that drives you on a daily basis?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.340
Is this this?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.800
Is it exit?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120
Is it the one you sell your

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.180
company for a lot of money?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.080
No, I don't think it's usually

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.840
the case in most entrepreneurs,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240
of course it's not so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.460
in our case.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.300
I think entrepreneurs like

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.440
to solve problems,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.320
we like to build things

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.860
and there's an emotional

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.800
motivation behind it.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.540
And you build something because

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.300
you usually have a mission or purpose.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.920
And when you make money, it is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.680
important, because it is very

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.060
hard to undertake and most

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.660
projects fail.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.620
Then there must be a good reward

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.880
for entrepreneurs

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.320
who want to risk everything,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.560
their career, their

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.660
wealth, etc.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.780
If there is no potential reward

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.060
for that, we't have entrepreneurs.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.800


00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.900
But, I don't think, that's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.800
not the main reason.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.260
That is, money comes because one

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.780
builds, evaluates and creates things,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.360
just the vital energy that moves

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.280
entrepreneurs is another

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.680
thing.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.660
That mission, that is what you want to.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.460
Money is the consequence.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.960
Effectively all entrepreneurs

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.040
know that there is the possibility

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.380
of exit, that probably

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.680
one day will come or not

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.340
come.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.680
But what really moves you on a daily

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.660
basis is that your product is getting

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.880
better, that your customers

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.080
are getting more valuable,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.780
etc.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.840
And if you do that well and don't

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.160
let yourself be stunned by singing

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.340
out of the sirens and stories of

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.640
those, then it will come.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.940
Of course, every business exists

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.700
for something.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.800
In the end, that's to help,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.080
to serve people, to solve a

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.580
problem, to make life easier,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.500
whatever it is.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.900
And I think that the beautiful thing is

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.320
the entrepreneur, that you create value

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.960
by helping other people.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.580
And creating jobs and paying

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.400
taxes along the way.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.120
It is very satisfactory.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.960
I want to finish, I'll give you

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.500
two things.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.960
First, congratulations on your

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.520
career, on what you have achieved

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.400
and on the successes that are

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.140
ahead of you.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.500
Second, thank you very much for

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.740
coming here and sharing it with us.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.900
Thank you very much, it is a pleasure.
