00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.120
Let's talk about the size of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.040
the market and let's see the main

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.440
model, which is the Samsung TAM, which

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.980
is used to help us quantify

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.620
the size of the market, which is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.540
what is called in English Market

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.380
Sizing.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.860
Before we start, we want to

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.300
put ourselves in context.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.460
When is this used?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.730
Well, for example, when we are

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.630
making a marketing plan and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.550
we have done segmentation,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.970
we have identified different segments,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.990
the next decision, targeting,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.750
well, because one of the key

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.150
factors to decide whether

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.990
we will be targeting a segment

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.790
or not, is to quantify the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.250
size of the market in that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.210
segment, see if it

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.250
is large enough.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.070
Or, for example, when we are analyzing

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.710
a business model, well, because that

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.750
is one of the key factors of analysis,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.490
and it is vital for an entrepreneur

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.970
when you are going to launch a

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.790
startup or when you are going

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.930
to launch an innovative project

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.090
or product.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.550
At that point what you have to do

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.230
is ask yourself, well, there is a

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.490
problem and besides that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.630
it is big enough that problem

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.050
and it has a sufficient number

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.290
of people.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.110
This is a big enough market

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.230
to make an investment,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.350
an effort.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.090
And why?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.930
Why do I recall this?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.450
Because what happens is a very

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.630
common mistake for companies,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.450
for entrepreneurs, startups,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710
etc., not even to raise it.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.730
And we have seen in very many

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.050
occasions, for example, we are

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.090
putting up many projects in which,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.330
well, because it sounds good,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.530
it seems that there is innovative

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.810
technology, an innovative value proposal,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.110
etc., all the same is fine, but

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.490
you take the paper and make four

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.590
numbers and you say, well, we

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.310
are talking about one that you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.790
can get to a 10 % and in addition

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.030
to that 10 % you may have a quota,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.990
you will end up having a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.290
quota of two, well, and you do

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.270
the numbers very quickly and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.110
you say it is not large enough.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.490
It is that not even in the best

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.810
of cases this will generate

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.390
enough income to justify

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.050
the effort you will make.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.090
You should spend your money and effort

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.910
on something else.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.150
Well, we have to stay alone with

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.030
that, with that really you have

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.690
to always make a decision of this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.090
type before deciding whether we

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.430
are going to an additional

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370
segment or if we create an additional

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.410
product, etc., always consider

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.450
the size of the market.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.890
It is large enough.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.720
Let's look at the most well-known

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.640
model that helps us, somehow helps

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.400
us to structure the analysis

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920
to quantify the market.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.140
And this one we have on the screen

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.520
is the TAM Samsung.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.180
I will explain each of the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.340
levels and I will also relate

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.800
it to an example.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.520
We start with the Tam.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.980
The TAM is the Total Approachable

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.360
Market, that is, the total

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.520
market you could target.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.980
And I'll give you an example, let'

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.400
s think, we're thinking about

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.680
an app like Tulotero, an

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680
app where you sell lotteries.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.180
So what would the TAM, the total

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.880
market, be?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.640
Well, we could consider the world

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.540
market, which is, I don't know,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.580
many billions, or we could consider,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.500
for example, the market

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.540
in Spain, which is 8.5 billion

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.920
euros.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.380
It is the total market.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200
Why is it important to have a

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.700
total market perspective even though

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.160
you won't be able to reach the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.180
entire market?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.880
This gives us information about

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.840
the potential for growth.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.840
Maybe with your current business

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.860
model you can't get there,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.840
but well, things could pivot, etc.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.480
And it's always better that the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.820
overall market is bigger.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.860
Then we have Sam.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.200
The SAM is really the target market.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.600
I will explain the difference between

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.940
the SAM and the TAM.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.100
The SAM is the market

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.140
we can reach from our

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.520
business model.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840
This is wide, right?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.920
What do I mean by this?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.400
Well, it may be that the TAM is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.840
the world market, but it is that

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.600
your business is, your business

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.540
model is thought to sell in

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.040
Spain.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.480
They have the money to sell Spain.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.980
So your SAM would be the market

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.760
in Spain.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.400
But, look, let's not forget about

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.820
the TAM, because today you are in

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.140
Spain, but maybe within a time

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.480
you have resources to get out.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.680
So the bigger the TAM, the better,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.320
right?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.960
But the SAM is your target

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.580
market, with your business

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.300
model, with your resources, etc.,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.840
it is the market you can reach.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.660
What you can get to.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.840
And in the case that you talked about

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.880
the lottery in Spain, for example,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.160
the TAM are 8.500 million, but look,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.560
it is that those 8.500 million

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.760
are not all sold through an

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.240
app or through the internet.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.280
I sell it at 10%.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.200
I'm giving supposed data, right?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.040
10% of the sales are made via the internet.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.720
You are an application.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.100
Well, because your SAM will be

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.060
10% of those 8.5 billion, that

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.660
is, 850 million.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.980
Your target market is 850

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.820
million today, because it's

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.120
the total lottery sold over

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.860
the internet.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200
Now, let's go to the sound.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.360
The SOM is the service obtainable,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.480
what you can get.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.220
Basically it is a percentage over the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.700
SAM.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.020
The target market is $850 million.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.640
You are not the only competitor,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.620
you have more competitors.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800
You will have a share, X whatever it is.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.020
Then what we will do is either

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.380
determine the current quota or

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.620
make a projection of the quota

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.060
we can in the medium term.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.760
What does the sound depend on?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.580
The sound will depend on a lot

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.080
of things.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.360
It depends on your value proposal,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.880
well, because you have a competitive

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.520
advantage, it depends on you

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.560
going to have resources to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.920
invest in marketing, etc.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.020
We need to make a credible

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.860
approach, a reasonable

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.260
approach.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.700
So, if I go back to the example that

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.520
was being put, the total market,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.920
the TAM, that gives us information

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.020
about the potential,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.900
right?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.360
The bigger it is better.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.840
For example, in the case of the world

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.460
lottery SOM Billions, in the case

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.160
of the lottery in Spain are 8500

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.640
million euros.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.400
But we will go to analyze a little

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.900
more in detail already, but those

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.960
8500 million are sold, not all are

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.340
sold on the internet or by

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.880
application or on a website.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.420
Let's see what percentage of them

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.180
are sold on a website.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.320
Let's say it's 10 percent.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.740
The total value is 850 million dollars,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.080
which is the target market.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.940
Well, but now what I have to

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.740
do is see within my target market,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.540
within the SOM, what share

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.560
will I have?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.080
Well, you have to make a projection

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.280
of the quota you will based

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.920
on, for that, your value proposal,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.260
that you are more competitive,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.360
less competitive, that

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.720
you have more resources

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.660
to invest in marketing,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.280
etc.
