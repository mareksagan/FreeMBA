00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.300
I am Borja de Anero.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.020
I think you all know me already.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
As you know, I am the CEO of Power

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.020
MBA and one of the founders of the company.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.960
Today I want to present

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.980
you the first of the courses.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.120
Let’s start with analysis and

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.500
business model generation.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.840
I want you to know that it is

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.820
not orthodox to start by business

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.500
models in a traditional MBA.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.840
And, in fact, curiously, almost

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320
no program incorporates a specific

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.000
module of business models.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.700
I think it is interesting, as

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.260
I said, because it is very interesting.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.620
I am convinced and would love

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.140
to do the test, hopefully we could

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.520
do it, if I asked you today to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.240
analyze the business model

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.100
of a simple business.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.180
But let’s think of the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.240
restaurant that is under your

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.360
house or a car dealer.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.420
I don’t know if we’re talking about

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.180
Google or Amazon.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.560
I think your analysis would be disorderly.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.520
In the best case, it would be a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.420
misguided analysis.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.780
It would be a puzzle with the pieces without mounting.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.460
And what I want and would love

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980
is that after this course, after

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.320
these first two weeks, you’

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.600
ll be able to mentally order the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.920
pieces of a business model.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.400
I like to explain it like that.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.060
I think we can equate it to understanding

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.100
the mechanism of a business

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.740
model.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.500
For example, I would like that if

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.800
we talk about any company, quickly,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.240
in your head you order who the customer

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.360
segments are, what value proposal

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
has been developed for each customer

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.980
segment, what is the distribution

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.240
channel through which they reach

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.540
their customers, what kind of relationships

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.820
are established with customers

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.040
if they are personal through,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.080
as we said, what kind of channels,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.660
what are the revenue flows

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.640
that are generated, how it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.020
is charged, depending on what,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.060
it is a product sale, service

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.340
sale, it is fixed, it is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.640
variable, it is recurrent,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.880
there is a subscription,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.280
it is licensed...

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.900
Well, there are many ways, there are

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.420
many different ways to generate income

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.800
and we will understand them.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.520
What are the key resources?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.260
It is very important to understand it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.880
What is needed to make

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.560
this business model work?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.740
What is Technology?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.620
Are they people?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.420
Are they assets?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.860
It must be very clear.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.260
Or what are the main activities

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.980
in which we have to be good,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.120
in which we have to put a lot

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.060
of focus in order for things

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.040
to work?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.220
Or do we need strategic

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.520
partnerships?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.560
Are we supporting ourselves or

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.120
are we supportive of third-party

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760
companies that provide us with

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.860
resources, that provide us

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.480
with knowledge, that help us?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.540
Or, for example, what are the costs?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.960
What are the main costs of the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.980
business model?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.380
Well, when you are able to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.980
analyze it with this perspective

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.520
and fit the pieces, your business

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.920
vision, your ability to analyze

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.180
improves a lot.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.300
And, in addition, we will teach you how

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.900
to incorporate concepts that are

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.940
key, such as whether the model

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.120
is scalable, whether there are entry barriers,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.660
if there are exchange costs, whether

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.140
the English are recurring or not.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.000
We should be able to analyze

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520
how the cash flow is.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.100
If the operations generate a lot

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.560
of treasury or, on the contrary, they

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.160
are demanding them, I think it will

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.440
be very enriching and will

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.000
help you a lot.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.040
I also want you to know that these

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.280
things are not learned overnight.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.820


00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.160
I do not intend that in two weeks

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.980
you will be a strategic consultant

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.520
able to analyze any type of business

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.560
model with a lot of depth, but

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.840
we will set the foundations, we

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000
will set the foundations with

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.260
theory and practice and analyze

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.640
cases so that you will assimilate

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.620
the concepts.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.960
And as time passes and we see

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.640
more cases and see it from more

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.540
perspectives, etc., I think

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.800
your ability to analyze will

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.720
improve a lot.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.540
And, in addition, I guarantee you

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.220
that the day you are truly

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.300
able to analyze a company

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.660
in depth, any business model

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.140
in depth, will help you a

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.680
lot in your professional career.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.840
You will understand better the company in

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.620
which you are working or if you are an

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.260
entrepreneur, many of our students

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.980
are entrepreneurs, you will understand

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.540
your business better, I guarantee you

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.680
will understand it better, or if

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.280
you are an entrepreneur, or if you are

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.880
an investor.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.860
In any case I think it is one

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.260
of the competencies and one

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.580
of the key skills for an expert

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.860
in the business world to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.180
be able to analyze a business

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.160
model.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.220
In the course of

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.560
the course, we will

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.860
use a tool called

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.120
Business Model Canvas.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.820


00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.860
It is a tool that I

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.900
personally love.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.620
I have been a strategic consultant

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.960
for many years, I have had

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.340
to use many strategic

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.600
analysis tools.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.420
I think this is the best there is.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.720
It is the best one for several reasons,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.860
and one of them is its simplicity.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.020
It is very intuitive and very simple.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.340
It will allow us to draw

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.440
any type of business model

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.020
in a very graphic way and will

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.400
help you understand it.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.140
But it not only serves to draw

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.220
or describe a business

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.080
model, but also will help us

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.880
to analyze it and help us

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.260
identify possible developments

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.140
of that business model.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.020
It will help us innovate.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.480
It’s something I always say and it’

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.620
s why I repeat it several times throughout

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.260
this course and it’s that innovation

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.540
doesn’t really require

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.160
you to be creative.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.800
You don’t have to be creative or

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.980
ingenious.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.120
To innovate helps very

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.780
much to have knowledge, to

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.820
have the base, to have the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.080
records.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.540
Because if you have those records it’

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.720
s much easier that you’re able to identify

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.840
where you’re going to evolve.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.640
It is much easier to get

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.800
the happy idea.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.760
Well, finally, I hope you

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.580
really enjoy this course.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.500
I think we have done an excellent job.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.860
We met with many very interesting

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.980
people you’ll meet, such

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.220
as the founder of Account

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.780
Plus, who was later the CEO

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.980
of Europa Exage.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.000
He sold his company in

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.840
2003 for $100 million.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.820
It was a case of bestial success.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.900
We will analyze with it and from the

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.400
perspective of innovation in the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.560
business model the keys to success.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.980
This is one example, but we will

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.580
see many more.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.280
We’ll meet Richie, who is a

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.780
very young entrepreneur,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.500
owner and CEO of Vintail, which

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.460
is a cave group that is

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.760
growing spectacularly.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.560
It is also a very mature sector,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.260
such as the wine industry.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.240
And we will analyze, because we will

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.060
analyze the key to that growth.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.600
Nothing, I ask you now.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.240
I hope you enjoy the course, I hope

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.660
you participate and I hope that

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.180
in two weeks, your ability

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.680
to analyze a business model will

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.200
be much greater than it is

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.580
today.
