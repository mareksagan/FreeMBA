WEBVTT

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.440
I want to share with you briefly

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.420
the analysis of the banking sector

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.880
and in particular of ING Direct

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.900
for, because we will visualize

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.500
the value curves of the sector

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.520
and will help you understand why

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.000
it is such a useful tool to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.020
explain or describe a differentiation,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.880
a competitive advantage.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.880
A differential proposal.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.560
Let us go to the case of the direct.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.440
As I said, the first thing

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.480
we have to do is think about

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.140
what are the competitive factors

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.760
around which, in this case,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.020
the banking industry or the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.320
commercial banking sector

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.160
revolves.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.840
And I think, well, let's start.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.900
Security is a major factor,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.440
we almost give it for granted,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.660
but it is clear that if a bank does

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.520
not provide you with security,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.200
you would never entrust your

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.920
money to them.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.220
The profitability that you offer

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.060
for your money, the number of products

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.720
or the range of products

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.580
that a bank has, a main factor,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.400
also very associated with

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.260
a huge investment, is the capillarity

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.540
of the offices and cashers

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.720
that a bank has.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.900
It has been one of the main

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.760
competitive advantages in the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.140
past, because it was the only

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.360
distribution channel, the only

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.740
way to reach customers.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.360
But there are other factors that

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.880
are also highly valued by the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.000
customer and increasingly like

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.460
the possibility of making highs

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.440
or lows or processes telematically

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.660
through the internet, through

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.120
phone, etc.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.560
And finally, we left it for the end,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.600
but it is very important, it is

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.320
the commissions.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.760
Well, so we're going to draw the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.200
value curve of two banks now

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.980
that could really be like BBVA

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.040
or as Banks in Tandem, but

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.960
well, the truth is we could think

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.240
about almost any bank.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.280
What is the value curve?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.480
I think that in terms of safety,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240
profitability, product range, offices

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.380
and cashers are very much

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.220
above, they have a great structure

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.420
and they provide all

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.160
those values.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800
However, if we go to other values,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.940
such as in this case telematic

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.320
highs and lows, well, because

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.780
they are improving, but they have

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.200
never put, so far they have not

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.140
put much focus on it and are

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020
not excessively good, right?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.100
And finally, as far as commissions

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.620
are concerned, well, because they charge

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.120
the traditional commissions in the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.900
sector, we put it there, right?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.600
And now what we're going to do is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.960
let's draw the curve of ING Direct

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.000
and let's understand the differentiation,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.300
right?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.620
The basic values of safety

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.880
and profitability are

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.560
the same or very similar.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.820
As for product range, it may

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.460
have less range of products,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.000
what is clear in the great differentiation

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.940
is that the curve

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.320
is very different in terms

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.260
of product range.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.620
Initially, it didn't have offices,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.760
now it has very little presence, it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.240
has invested very little in that,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.320
so the value as we have seen in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.700
the curve is very low, right?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.260
The value offered is very low, however,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.140
it compensates because it offers

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.220
a lot of value through agile,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100
comfortable processes, etc.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.600
Well, that, via phone, via internet,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.240
what we have called high and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.440
low telematics, but well, you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.540
understand the concept, right?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.280
And there the curve is much higher

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.740
and this change also allows

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.360
you to offer much lower

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.660
commissions.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.560
Well, as we see, it is clear that ING

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.880
has sought its hole, it has

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.320
sought its differentiation, right?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.880
It has a different value proposition

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.100
than others.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.460
There would be...

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.280
We can argue whether it is low

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.100
cost or differentiation, well, because...

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.640
I don't have it so clear because there

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.240
are people, effectively, offer a smaller

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.980
commission, but there is a segment

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.220
of customers that does not value,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.780
does not perceive any value in the capillary

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.060
of the offices of restaurants because

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.020
they do not want to go to the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.920
office, what they want to do

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.500
is the processes in a telematic way.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.280
That is, well, in any case, what

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.500
you have created is a value

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.780
proposal different from the others

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.440
that a segment of customers

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.320
convinces you.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.320
And that has been or that was,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.320
originally, the key to the success, the

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.700
enormous success and the enormous

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.040
growth that ING had.
