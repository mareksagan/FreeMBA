00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.690
You will learn how the Igor

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.810
Ansov matrix works, which is

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.450
the most well-known tool

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.490
or model in terms of growth

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.450
strategies.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.610
Why is it so well known

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.790
and used?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.670
Well, because it's very practical,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.170
it's very easy to understand

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.790
and allows us to classify any

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.570
type of alternative or growth

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.790
action within this matrix.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.230
Let's see what Ansov says.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.470
Ansov says you can grow in two

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.550
dimensions.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.390
You can grow with the products

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.930
you already have or you can

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.270
grow with new products.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.390
And the other dimension is that you

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.370
can grow within the current market

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.610
or within the current customer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970
segment or by heading to new

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.410
markets, to new segments.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.490
Moreover, and this is very obvious

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.550
and very common sense, the more

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.050
you get away in the bottom-left corner

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.230
matrix, the more you get away from

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.590
your market or product, the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.210
more risk there is.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.390
The four growth strategies

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.830
have a different risk that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.770
we will see.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.030
And they are the following.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.530
The main strategy

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.450
of growth is market penetration.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.810


00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.590
It's growing with your current product

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.630
within your current market,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.390
targeting you to your current customer

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.550
segments.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.990
Or you can within your current

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.070
market to do a product development

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.810
and sell them new products

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.110
to your current segment.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.830
You can grow into the other dimension.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.190
Now what we do is to go to other

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.450
markets or other segments,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.570
but with our current

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.370
product.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.950
And finally, diversification,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.670
which is new markets and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.430
new products, is the strategy

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.150
that has the greatest risk.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.310
Let us look at each of them

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.310
in a little more detail.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.170
Penetration into the market, as we

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.030
have said, we are directed to

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.050
our current market with the products

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.950
we already have.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.310
It is the logical strategy of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490
growth, it is the initial strategy

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.250
always, it is the obvious.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.050
As long as you can grow, grow where

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.930
there is no risk.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.890
Examples, there are thousands of examples.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.790
Opening a store, investing in

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.710
advertising, investing in

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770
a sales force, developing the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.750
distribution channel, all

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.990
that allows you to grow with

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050
your product in your current

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.190
market, penetration in the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.610
market.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.870
What is what happens?

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.530
If you remember the life cycle, what

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490
happens is that it is not always possible

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.670
to continue growing in the current

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.310
market.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.090
There is a time when it is impossible.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.030
When is this given?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.530
No, not in the introductory phase.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.630
There is still a lot of market

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.130
to grow, not even in the growth phase.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.130
We can still grow, we can invest and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.350
we can grow, we can invest and at this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.130
time things are complicated.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.910
It's no longer so easy to grow, unless

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.190
you have a huge competitive advantage,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.770
it's not usual.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.370
You have to fight for every point

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.470
of the market share, you have

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.990
to fight with your competitors.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.650
In this scenario, it seems reasonable

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.750
to look for growth alternatives

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.470
that have more risk.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.390
And what are they?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.790
Either we develop new products

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.810
or what we do is go to other

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.950
markets, look for other

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.130
customer segments in which

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.150
we can grow.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.550
Development of new products.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.090
I will give you an example.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.310
Remember, it's selling new products

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.910
to your existing customers.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.170
What is BMW doing with

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.010
the development of its

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.110
electric car range?

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.090
Exactly that.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.310
He has developed a new technology,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.250
a little different cars

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.090
and is selling it to his current

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.230
customer segment.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.270
The car market is a very

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.930
mature market where it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.070
is very difficult for

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.570
BMW to win a lot of money

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.910
by taking away its

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.210
direct competitors

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.430
such as Mercedes

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.770
or Audi.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.110
So what it does is to do a product

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.430
development, to grow the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.630
business in this way.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.890
Take Ikea for example.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.730
Ikea offers a range of value-

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.310
added services such

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.670
as transportation,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.590
car rental, etc.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.110
That is a clear product development.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.750
To whom is it sold?

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.950
To your current customers, to the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.890
customers who will enter the store and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.470
offer more products.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.410
Let us now look at the development of markets.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.590
Market development is, with what

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.570
we already have, targeting

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.750
new customer segments.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.910
These customer segments may be in

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.250
other locations in the world.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.130
That is, it can be the classic international

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.910
expansion very logical when your

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.670
market no longer grows.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.190
What is what you do?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.990
The world is big, you go to other

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.410
places.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.710
But I also want you to stay with

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.570
that there is not only international

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.390
expansion.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.050
You can also search for new

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.390
customer segments using new

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.050
distribution channels.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.130
If you implement an e-commerce and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.570
start selling online, you will be

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.730
able to target a slightly different

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.050
customer segment, the one

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.450
you were selling.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.190
In the case of a company like Inditex.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.350
Or think of an outlet, in the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.630
fashion retail sector.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.850
If a company like Mango sells

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.630
to a new market, it is targeting

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.070
a new customer segment with

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.330
its current product.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.650
If you think so, the clothes that

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.350
are inside, the product is exactly

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.910
the same as you have in your traditional stores.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.690
What happens is that by selling

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.590
it in outlet format you can target

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.990
a segment of customers with the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.430
higher price sensitivity.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.380
And finally, there is diversification.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.900
Diversification is that we are

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.280
heading to new markets with new

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.240
products and is the strategy

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.500
that has the most risk.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.020
We will not go into detail now

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.020
because we will make a specific

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.100
class for the diversification strategy.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.300
Finally, we will analyze the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.600
alternatives or growth strategy

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.980
of McDonald's by linking

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.840
it to the growth matrix

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.720
of Igor Ansov.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.300
What can McDonald's do to grow?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.080
You can open more restaurants

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.560
in the markets you are in.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.420
But that is limited.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.120
I still imagine it has some growth

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.060
margin, but in many markets, in

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.220
many mature markets where

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.280
McDonald's has been in

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.220
place for many years, it

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.980
cannot open, it cannot double

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.180
or triple the number

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.180
of restaurants.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.960
They need to find alternatives

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.260
to growth.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.240
We will think about product development.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960
Remember to sell new products

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.100
to existing customers.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.420
Well, McDonald's launched an

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.640
initiative, a very successful

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.580
product development strategy

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.300
that was to start

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.140
selling breakfasts.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.260
Think of it, McDonald's has the

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.680
restaurants, has the customers, has

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920
the space, has the employees

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.560
and what he did was sell

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.920
meals and dinners.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.700
Well, you created a new product that

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.340
is breakfast that allows you

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.140
to increase the profitability

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.380
of all your investments,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.480
your assets, your employees,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.220
etc.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.980
It is product development.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.180
Another product development,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.520
with less development, with less

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.280
degree of difference from their

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.440
traditional product, is to

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.040
start offering that made years

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.160
ago healthier products,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.840
healthier dishes.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.440
I sold fries, hamburgers,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.300
dogs, etc.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.780
And there was a portion of her clients

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.300
who demanded, especially family

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300
parents who went with children,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.600
demanded healthier, less-

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.540
calorie food.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.700
Well, McDonald's made a product

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.860
development and incorporated

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.240
into salads.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.200
What other options does McDonald's have?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.160
The development of the

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.900
market and growth worldwide.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.480
McDonald's is present in almost everyone,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.620
but there are still areas that

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.860
we have in blue where it does

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.540
not have a presence.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.260
Growing in these areas, expanding

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.960
their international geographical

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.060
coverage would be a clear strategy

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.860
for developing international

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.180
markets, international

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.320
expansion.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.040
And finally, the diversification.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.440
McDonald's hasn't diversified

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.600
much, but we can see an initiative

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.380
that can be considered diversification,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.660
which is the Mccafes.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.720


00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.800
It is a different product, it is not

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.120
a hamburger, it is a coffee shop and

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.400
is aimed at a probably different

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.780
customer segment, because they

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.320
demand a different product.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.380
It is a diversification strategy.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.840
Here is the matrix again.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.240
From now on, when you think about

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.440
a growth strategy, always

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.100
think about these terms.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.380
Always think that there are

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.820
four alternatives to growth and

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.780
that every strategy can

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.180
be classified within the Ansov matrix.
