00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
Facebook is a company that we all know as users, but it is also a company that we have

00:10.400 --> 00:12.440
to understand as a company.

00:12.440 --> 00:18.340
And that's why what we are going to do is share five ideas, five things you should know.

00:18.340 --> 00:27.200
The first is that Facebook is one of the five largest companies in the world.

00:27.200 --> 00:33.200
If we analyze the rankings for stock market capitalization in the world, the five largest

00:33.200 --> 00:37.480
companies, although there is some volatility, are the five large technological companies

00:37.480 --> 00:43.240
that are Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.600
As you can see, Facebook is in that war.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.000
Two, Facebook is one of the most profitable companies and the one that grows the most in

00:50.000 --> 00:56.640
the world.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.280
We have several companies that we all know based on two variables.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.360
On the X axis we have annual growth by income.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.680
And on the Y axis we have margins.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.800
We have companies like Netflix or Amazon, which, as we see, grow a lot but with very

01:14.800 --> 01:19.160
low margins and have very low or lost profits in some years.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.520
And we have companies with slightly higher margins, such as Apple or Google.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.680
But the winner of all is Facebook, which, as we see, is the one that grows the most and

01:28.680 --> 01:31.560
is also the one with the highest margins.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.720
And we are going to see it with data.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.640
Facebook has an annual income last year of 40 billion dollars.

01:39.640 --> 01:46.040
And this data is very interesting, but maybe more interesting is to see the annual trend.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.040
And if we look at the graph, what we see is that a clear upward trend is seen, that is,

01:52.040 --> 01:56.360
that growth prospects are still excellent.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.240
As we said, it is one of the companies that grows the most in the world.

01:59.240 --> 02:06.680
And if we are going to analyze the margins or profitability or profits, we have 16 billion

02:06.680 --> 02:11.160
dollars in profit in 2017.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.920
We can quickly do the analysis.

02:12.920 --> 02:18.520
40 billion income, 16 billion profit, is a margin of 40%, which is a real

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
barbarity.

02:20.520 --> 02:24.200
And by the way, 16 billion dollars is a lot or a little.

02:24.200 --> 02:29.320
Because of course, when we talk about these magnitudes, it is difficult for us to situate ourselves.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.320
And I'm going to compare it with two Spanish companies.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.640
With Banco Santander, which has 8 in 2017 in millions of dollars, 8 billion dollars

02:37.640 --> 02:39.720
in profit, half that of Facebook.

02:39.720 --> 02:45.560
Or with Inditex, which is the largest textile group in the world, which has 3,800 million.

02:45.560 --> 02:51.120
You should know that Facebook, not only Facebook, but it is a group that has had an ambitious policy

02:51.120 --> 02:56.760
of inorganic growth acquisitions and that is formed today by more than 66 companies.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.240
The best known acquisitions have been Instagram for a billion dollars, Oculus Rift, which

03:10.280 --> 03:16.360
is the manufacturer of virtual reality glasses, and the most recent import has been the purchase

03:16.360 --> 03:20.960
of WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars, 19 billion.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.640
The most important thing you have to learn today is that Facebook is the second advertising platform

03:26.640 --> 03:28.240
in the world, after Google.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.040
And the first thing we are going to do is analyze a little bit how this market is.

03:38.040 --> 03:44.040
If we analyze the market of online advertising platforms, Google and Facebook have

03:44.040 --> 03:46.040
60%, it is a duopolio.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.960
Google with a higher market share.

03:49.960 --> 03:55.680
And if we analyze the total of the cake of the advertising market in the world, total I mean

03:55.680 --> 04:02.320
that not only online but online and offline, Google and Facebook have 25%, Google 18%

04:02.320 --> 04:05.480
and Facebook 7%.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.720
Well, what we are going to do is analyze the Facebook model and we are going to identify

04:09.720 --> 04:15.080
what are the keys that have led it to be the second platform in the world.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.000
If we see the business model canvas, it will allow us to understand the advertising model well.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.200
What we have is the users of the social network, we have 2,200 million on Facebook,

04:26.200 --> 04:31.640
1,000 million on Instagram, although there is really a huge duplicity, and Facebook what

04:31.640 --> 04:38.560
it brings them is, well, you already know, connecting with other people, interesting content, etc.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.160
And this allows you to monetize it through the advertisers, which are the companies that

04:43.160 --> 04:48.200
we hire campaigns on Facebook, which is what generates 95% of Facebook's income.

04:48.200 --> 04:54.920
And what I want is now that we analyze what are the keys to all this, why Facebook,

04:54.920 --> 04:57.640
what is different about Facebook from the others?

04:57.640 --> 05:01.320
And we have identified mainly three keys.

05:01.320 --> 05:06.480
One of them, which is very obvious, is the huge mass of users.

05:06.480 --> 05:11.080
We are talking about thousands of millions of people and this, what is the advantage for

05:11.080 --> 05:12.080
an advertiser?

05:12.080 --> 05:14.680
Well, it's very easy, it's the reach you have.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.600
You from your home, on your computer, you can reach, well, that, an audience, you can reach

05:18.600 --> 05:23.680
everyone basically, because almost everyone has Facebook.

05:23.680 --> 05:27.280
The second one is something you have to understand very well and surely you have heard it many

05:27.280 --> 05:32.040
times, is that Facebook has a lot of information about us.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.920
It is permanently obtaining data every time you browse on Facebook.

05:36.920 --> 05:43.000
And all kinds of data, because you fill in your profile and you are permanently giving

05:43.000 --> 05:45.080
to pages that you follow, etc.

05:45.080 --> 05:51.240
Or, for example, when you use Facebook Login to log in to other applications, well,

05:51.240 --> 05:55.040
that is generating a footprint every day.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
What is this good for Facebook?

05:56.800 --> 06:03.000
Well, it is worth it to put it in value with all the advertisers, because it is very good for advertisers

06:03.000 --> 06:07.360
to be able to make very segmented campaigns and we can make segmented campaigns because

06:07.360 --> 06:09.600
Facebook gets all that information.

06:09.600 --> 06:15.320
You will really know it in detail, the Facebook Ads Manager, but it is huge the amount of

06:15.320 --> 06:19.960
variables that you can use to segment and to address exactly your target audience.

06:19.960 --> 06:27.880
And the third of the keys we have called Engagement, which is perhaps attention.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.360
And this is a key very inherent to a social network.

06:31.360 --> 06:37.280
A Facebook user or in general of any social network spends a lot of time on the social network.

06:37.280 --> 06:43.120
Specifically on Facebook, the average is about 35 minutes a day and you connect

06:43.120 --> 06:45.000
half nine times a day.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.400
I think it is very representative of what I'm talking about.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.520
You are generating a huge value to Facebook as a user because you spend a lot of time

06:51.520 --> 06:59.000
consuming content from Facebook and that allows Facebook to offer a huge value to advertisers.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.920
And why?

07:00.920 --> 07:07.000
Well because the advertiser has the possibility of having a huge impact on the life of that

07:07.000 --> 07:11.280
person of his target audience, because his target audience spends 35 minutes on average

07:11.280 --> 07:13.840
on Facebook and connects nine times a day.

07:13.840 --> 07:18.600
You have numerous ways to impact him systematically.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.200
You can get into his life to explain it in a simple way.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.800
This is a huge value for advertisers.

07:23.800 --> 07:30.320
And these are the three keys that basically attract us to all companies, whether small,

07:30.320 --> 07:35.520
large, medium and so it is very easy to understand why we all make huge investments

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
on Facebook.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.080
And this is what has led Facebook to have those giant invoices that have those margins

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
exorbitant.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.080
I also want you to understand that Facebook is an ultra scalable company.

07:53.080 --> 07:58.080
Before we talked about very high margins, 40% of sales.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.080
What is this due to?

07:59.080 --> 08:02.080
Well, it is due to the scalability that we have talked about so much.

08:02.080 --> 08:07.080
And I can give you the example of a company like us, like The Power MBA.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.080
In The Power MBA, the monthly investment in Facebook is very high.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.080
It is a very high amount.

08:15.080 --> 08:20.080
However, we have not generated any additional cost to Facebook.

08:20.080 --> 08:25.080
That is, all the money we invest monthly on Facebook is absolutely net.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
The gross margin is 100%.

08:27.080 --> 08:32.080
Because they do not have to dedicate additional resources, we only use technology.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.080
When you reach a certain volume, in some cases they assign you an account manager.

08:37.080 --> 08:41.080
But only for companies that invest a lot on Facebook.

08:41.080 --> 08:46.080
Another fact that I think is quite representative of the scalability of Facebook is that, for example,

08:46.080 --> 08:52.080
in a country like Spain, in a market of more than 45 million people, it has 40 employees.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.080
That is, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of companies like us, larger, smaller,

08:57.080 --> 09:01.080
that are spending a lot of money, but they only need 40 employees to manage it.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
Why?

09:02.080 --> 09:06.080
Because basically, technology, as we saw, is an ultra scalable resource.

09:06.080 --> 09:12.080
And finally, I am going to share with you that in addition to a advertising platform,

09:12.080 --> 09:14.080
Facebook is a platform for developers.

09:21.080 --> 09:25.080
That is, it works the same as a platform that can be iOS or Android.

09:25.080 --> 09:32.080
Facebook contributes a technology on which companies, which are the developers,

09:32.080 --> 09:34.080
create their applications.

09:34.080 --> 09:40.080
And Facebook allows it, it is like a distribution channel for those app manufacturers,

09:40.080 --> 09:41.080
for developers.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.080
Because Facebook allows you to reach millions of users.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
It allows you to sell, it allows you to monetize.

09:46.080 --> 09:50.080
And that generates an additional income flow to Facebook.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.080
Because those applications, in many cases, are premium models,

09:54.080 --> 09:59.080
in which every time payments occur within the application, Facebook commissions for it.

09:59.080 --> 10:05.080
And it is possible that if you are not a Facebook user, you do not come to mind what I am talking about.

10:05.080 --> 10:11.080
But for example, there was a game like Farville, which became very popular,

10:11.080 --> 10:13.080
which is basically what I'm talking about.

10:14.080 --> 10:21.080
People who play through Facebook to games that developers have developed.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.080
So at some point those games, in many cases, are premium,

10:25.080 --> 10:29.080
and when you are paying, Facebook is making money with each of those payments.
