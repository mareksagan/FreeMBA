WEBVTT

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.500
We will analyze the case of the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.380
PINADA from the perspective of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.740
the Blue Ocean Strategy.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.120
Well, what is clear is that the PINADA

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.680
has a lot of Blue Ocean, it meets

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.700
all the criteria, because we talked

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.640
about non-customers, creates

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.780
much more value, etc.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.800
How do you create more value?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.740
Well, I'm sure you're already

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.800
able to identify it, because

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.980
Iker has told us, incorporated

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.460
a lot of services of all kinds

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.020
that are within the neighborhood,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.480
incorporates education,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.420
services of all kinds

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.900
of mobility, cost savings, etc.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.100
But what I'm going to go to now

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.480
is a very important concept, which

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.720
is value innovation.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.420
To create a Blue Ocean it is

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.720
not just about offering more value,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.260
you also have to reduce

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.660
the costs of the company a lot.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.360
And it's something that you may

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.000
have overlooked, but it's that the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.840
cost savings in the PINADA are bestial

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.040
and you have told us.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.740
He told us the following, he told

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.940
us that the value chain within

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.500
the sector is usually the next,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.660
there is a promoter who buys the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.980
soil, urbanizes it, etc.,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.440
and then in many cases it is

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.420
another promoter who sells housing.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.760
The point is that when housing

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.720
in the market is usually

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.660
urbanized, that investment

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.400
has already been made.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.480
And he changes this equation, and what

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.140
he does is, before urbanizing the neighborhood,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.140
incorporate already in the creation

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.960
process customers.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.000
What he has achieved, he has

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.060
told us, is to reduce to a tenth

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.680
the needs of equity, that is,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.120
of own funds that he has

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.440
to contribute.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.600
Therefore, value innovation is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.400
bestial because it can increase

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.960
the value perceived by customers

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.540
by incorporating them into the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.020
co-creation of all that neighborhood,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.940
all its space, all that community

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.880
and reduce, fix, in a 90%

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.280
the needs of that investment

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340
in own funds.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
Let us look at it now from

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.560
the value curve perspective so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.240
that we can see how this particular

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.700
movement affects the value curve.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.140
And in the next class what we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.160
will do is to analyze in more

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.640
detail what are the competitive

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880
factors that PINADA incorporates

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.560
and which makes it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.380
increase the value through,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.360
as we saw services, etc.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.160
We will do a quick analysis of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.840
the competitive factors in the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.740
real estate promotion sector.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.640
We have the price, we have the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.560
location, maybe the location

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.800
is the most important because the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.880
qualities, the price, etc. are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.680
usually determined by the location

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.600
and in addition the price of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.020
the soil that depends on the location

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.240
is a very determining factor

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.980
of the cost.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.400
Quality, the variety of types,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.620
the configuration you allow customers

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.960
and here what we have is urbanization,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.560
that is, the fact that it is

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.760
already urbanized, that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.560
it is a finished product

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.180
in terms of urbanization.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.060
Well, I have incorporated this factor

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.240
because it really is the key

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.760
in this case of the innovation

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.240
in value of the PINADA.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.080
What the PINADA does is reduce the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.700
investment very much or eliminate

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.640
it directly the investment in

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.780
urbanization because it goes to the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.240
market without having urbanized

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.760
the neighborhood and what allows

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.350
is to increase the configuration

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.130
process very much not only of

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.610
the housing but of the whole space,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.070
of the whole neighborhood, of

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.210
the organization, etc.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.150
He speaks of co-creation so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.530
as we see the value curve is totally

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.590
different and it gets to increase

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.330
value much by making partisans

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.870
in the co-creation process that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.510
has been shown to increase value

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.650
by simply by the demand

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.750
it is having and reduce

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.650
the cost by going out to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.150
the market in a phase of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.430
the previous value chain

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.290
which helps to reduce much

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.050
the needs of investment

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.690
in equity funds.
