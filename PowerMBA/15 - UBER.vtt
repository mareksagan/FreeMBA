00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.070
Uber is a very interesting company.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.770
Mainly because it is an authentic

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.490
clock bomb and it is that, fix you,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.190
it has all the records as to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.190
the company that loses the most

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.530
money every year, the company

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.310
that grows the most, the startup

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.990
that has reached higher

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.610
values and in addition in the

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.830
last years PanamaSindri has

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.210
become a super controversial

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.970
company.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.770
He has been involved in numerous

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.030
scandals in recent years, which

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.090
we will see.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.770
Let's start by looking at

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.010
Uber's business model.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.330
The first thing I want you to consider

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.830
is that it is a platform on

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.610
demand.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.610
Uber is not a marketplace.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.530
In a marketplace, for example,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.550
let's think of Airbnb, the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.610
offer sets the prices.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.230
The offer is usually very automated.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.710
In the case of Uber, this is not the case.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.670
In the case of Uber and other

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.170
on-demand platforms, the prices and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.770
guarantees of the service, etc.,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.130
are offered by the platform itself.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.890
We are looking at the Canvas business model.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.230
We have made a mirror mode adaptation

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.270
where we have placed both sides

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.930
of the platform's two

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.850
customer segments.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.810
On one side we have the drivers

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810
and on the other we have the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.690
passengers.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.210
The value proposal for travelers,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.590
you know, is transport services

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.250
with a more technological

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.130
user experience than

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.330
that of a taxi with more economical

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.430
prices in almost all

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890
types of travel, etc.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.130
We will not get into this.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.010
And then we have the drivers.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.130
It is important to note that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.810
depending on the legislation

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.190
of different countries,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.030
the model is different.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.670
There are places like in Spain that

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.990
are regulated.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.510
Then drivers have to have a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.910
certain license, which

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.070
in Spain is called VTC, but this

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.970
is not the important thing.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.750
And in other places, like in the vast majority

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.510
of the United States, it is not regulated.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.770
Anyone can be

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.270
a Uber driver.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.290
What is Uber's offer

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.910
to drivers?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.750
Basically what is offered are

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.170
or additional income, whether

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.450
you are a sporadic driver

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.430
or actually a job, if you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670
are a regular driver.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.290
In any case, the drivers

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.910
are not Uber employees.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.170
This is a platform.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.790
And now we'll look at how

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.710
the revenue flow and main costs

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.970
of all the money that is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.790
transacted on Uber work,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.910
that's when you hire a trip

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.130
on Uber, pay through the app,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.830
give 100%, 80% goes to the driver

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.230
and 20% goes to the platform

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.570
around 80-20, although

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.230
this is changing.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.030
We already understand the business model.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.950
It's a business model in principle

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.310
that seems profitable and sustainable,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.730
however, the reality

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.910
is that Uber has so far failed

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.470
to be profitable.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.470
Not only that, but Uber is the company

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.350
that loses the most money.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.530
In 2017 alone, the losses

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.510
were $4.5 trillion, that

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.230
is, $4.5 billion,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.390
which is a real barbarism.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.210
And look, so that you understand

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.050
the dimension of what we are

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.850
talking about, we'll compare it to Amazon.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.550
Amazon may sound like you, for

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.070
many years it has been losing

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.490
and this has made everyone

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.390
question Amazon and Jeff Bezos'

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.330
management.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.470
No one does it now, but in

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.270
the past it did.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.310
Well, because the year that lost the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.410
most money Amazon, the amount

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.550
of losses was 1.2 trillion.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.510
Compared to Uber last year.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.490
It is a barbarism, it is a

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.890
machine to lose money.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.550
Let's do an analysis of why you are

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.470
losing so much money.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.990
We will do this from

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.090
a purely financial perspective

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.190
and we will do so by analyzing

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.890
the 2017 results.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.610
You will see that the numbers are

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.750
not coming out.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.650
Uber commissions 20% on all

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.990
transactions within Uber.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.970
This amount is about

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.910
10% of the variable cost.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.090
So we would be talking about the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.350
margin of 10%.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.270
The current structure

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.670
is 15.6 percent.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.670
As you can see, it is not a sum.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.730
And here, of course, we say that a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.650
company once it loses so much money,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.850
which is the one that loses the most

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.830
money in the world, we understand that

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.910
it will be led to failure.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.190
It seems to be the opposite.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.810
And proof of this is that it has

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.010
beat all records in terms of

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.490
valuations, in terms of raised

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.890
money, in terms of interest on

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.930
the part of investors,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.420
etc.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.320
It has reached valuations close

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.940
to $70 trillion.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.680
And for you to make the idea is much

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.840
more valued than companies like

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.220
Airbnb, for example.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.320
And if we compare it with listed

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.320
companies, by the way, Uber is not

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.400
a listed company.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.500
It is expected to be out of stock.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.320
We were talking about 2018-2019.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.340
But, well, with all the controversy that

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.820
has been, it is possible that it will be delayed.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.560
It's not a good time for Uber to go to

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.240
the stock market.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.660
We'll compare it to giant listed

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.720
companies like Ford or General

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.620
Motors.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.300
Well, I want you to know that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.160
Uber, despite losing so much money,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.180
is a much more valuable company

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.920
than Ford or General Motors.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680
And here it seems we are losing

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.880
something, because what is the explanation

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.900
for all this?

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.040
How can it be that losing so

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.720
much money is such a valuable company?

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.900
Let us try to understand it.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.600
On the one hand, this is

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.560
a very simple conclusion, there

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.540
is the growth of sales.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.040
Uber loses money, but every year

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.300
its sales grow enormously.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.720
Here is the graph.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.660
We are looking at the volume of

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.280
transactions, of everything that

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.020
is transacted within the platform.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.980
And we are seeing that in 2017

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.360
it grew by about 50%.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.760
It is a real barbarism.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.320
Well, this has to be taken into

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.800
account because we are talking

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.080
about a very scalable model,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.320
in which if you continue to grow

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680
at this rate, but your structure

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.660
costs, remember that the structure

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.680
costs weighed 15.6%, but

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.980
if your structure costs

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.880
do not grow proportionately,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.600
there will be a time, as it

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.960
happens in sales, it is

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.500
reversed and those giant

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.040
losses are likely to become,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.820
given that huge volume

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.300
of income, become very

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.120
quantitative profits.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.540
Another fact to keep in mind is that

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.460
Uber is currently still in a very

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.640
aggressive phase of

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.780
international expansion and this,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.200
of course, requires, during that

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.680
phase, that your investments and

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.240
costs be very high and that you

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.560
profit those investments in

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.480
a timeframe.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.820
All this is quite obvious, but

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.440
we'll go, we'll go again, we'll

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.160
see the business model.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.040
Remember what was the

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.100
main cost.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.540
The main cost part is the

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.740
drivers' payments, which

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.280
are around 80% of the

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.440
total sales.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.200
Here is the key, here is

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.000
the lever.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.260
If Uber manages to reduce,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.620
imagine, since from 80 to 70%,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.220
it would be increasing its margin

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.500
by 50%, and if we multiply it by

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.000
the astronomical amounts it

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.380
transacts is very much money.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.700
How can you do this?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.340
Well, as you gain market

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.580
share, it is possible

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.280
that you will or will have

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.420
more trading power over drivers

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.520
and you can play with

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.760
those margins.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.240
But what really would have

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.120
a greater impact on the result

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.060
account is if Uber was able

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.760
to eliminate drivers' costs.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.460
I'll think about it, but how is it

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:45.920
possible?

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.460
This is impossible because of course,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.860
Uber's model requires drivers.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.200
Well, Uber has been investing

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.040
in technology for developing

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.900
autonomous driving in recent

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.200
years, as Google has

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.400
been doing too.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.980
He has invested in autonomous cars

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.720
and has also bought a company

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.700
called Oto, which are trucks also

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.420
with autonomous driving.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.920
This project is stopped because there

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.320
was a crash in the United States

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.120
and a girl died with one of these

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.740
cars, then they stopped the project,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.980
at least temporarily, but imagine

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.680
that in a time frame, it is possible

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.520
that this will not happen in the

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.040
short term, it will not happen

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.160
in the short term, but we are

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.060
talking about 5 or 10 years.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.900
Uber currently transacts $37

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.800
trillion with a main cost that

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.740
is 80% of that amount, which

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.580
is the cost of drivers,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.200
imagine that it can

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.700
eliminate that game.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.760
It would become one of the most

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.760
valuable companies in the world.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.720
Finally, let's talk about the

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.640
controversy.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.580
I've said before that Uber is an extreme

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.700
company in everything.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.380
It is also extreme in this.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.300
From the first day, their business

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.160
model has generated huge

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.620
clashes against the main player

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.440
in their industry, which are taxis

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.540
and taxis always considered

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.380
to be unfair competition

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.080
and this because that imagines,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.340
trials, strikes, etc.,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.620
all over the world.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.540
Uber also faces, that this is

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.440
a big risk, faces legal contentious

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.800
at certain sites,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.020
with the risk that it will

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.440
legally be obliged to hire

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.500
drivers, to incorporate

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.940
them within the company.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.940
Of course, this would have a huge

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.300
impact on the business model,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.420
because it would cease to be a scalable,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.280
flexible, etc., and would go

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.640
from good to first to have

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.920
tens of thousands of employees,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.520
with the impact that it has

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.820
on the account of results.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.920
But it is that in addition in recent

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.500
years there has been a lot

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.380
of controversy, for example, Travis

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.340
Kalakny, who is one of the

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.780
co-founders of Uber, is a very

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.440
controversial figure, gave his support,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.800
participated in a council

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.180
related to the Trump campaign

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.640
and there was a campaign against

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.700
Uber on Twitter, with a hashtag

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.200
that was delete Uber, which managed

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.940
to 200 thousand people in three

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.760
days to uninstall the app.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.600
But this is not here, because

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.740
an employee in a hashtag posted

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.140
that she had suffered sexual

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.460
harassment, that there is discrimination,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.120
there has been a lot of noise

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.140
in recent years, and this has

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.600
led to the president leaving Uber

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.420
and also publicly stated that

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.380
he didn't like Uber practices,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.700
or for example, that Travis

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.920
Kalakny was eventually forced,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.380
because several of the company's

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.300
main investors asked

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.620
him, the CEO and co-founder

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.300
was forced to resign.
