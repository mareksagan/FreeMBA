00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.200
We will analyze or we will evaluate

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.960
SEO, the advantages and disadvantages

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200
as a channel relative to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.620
others.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.980
What should we take into account?

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.660
As I said, knowledge

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.440
is needed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.360
Second, it is not immediate, it must

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.600
be worked out and it can take time and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.240
it is a dull process.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.260
Competition is fierce for two reasons,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.880
it's because in the end there are

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.240
more and more companies that have

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.240
a website and this is a content that's

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.420
there.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.760
And second, we also note that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.720
search engines are companies

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.880
that have to make money

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.460
and make money from SEM ads.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.700
They are leaving less and less space for SEO.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.360
I think it's true that the organic

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.220
levels are getting lower.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.900
actually is.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.220
Even, for example, on the mobile,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
only one SEO link, depending on the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.320
mobile terminal.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.020
More than 50% of searches are

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.760
mobile now.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.060
actually is.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.880
This is because we depend on algorithms.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780
There are things that are uncontrollable.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.680
A change in algorithm, a coma

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.680
of some element and we have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.060
a problem.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.140
I want to add one thing to this.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.900
In general, in digital marketing,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.060
on all the platforms we use,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.860
we rely on the algorithm.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.460
You have to live with it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480
You have to accept it, but it has

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.600
an impact on your business, because

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.600
you change the algorithm and there

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
are companies that have gone to ruin.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.300
actually is.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.960
But therefore we need to work

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.540
on a mix.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.440
You can't afford to risk

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.960
everything on the same platform.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.580
It can actually be dangerous.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.920
A lot of points in favor of SEO.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.320
It is free.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.160
Let me say that it is not advertising.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.540
It has a certain cost because content

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.640
costs money, the technician

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.900
costs money, etc.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.300
It is free and, above all, very sustainable.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.380
Once we have SEO well mounted,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.740
it is a virtuous circle.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.200
We will perpetually generate

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.900
quality and free traffic.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.300
Yes, quality, because it is free and also

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600
the people who are looking for you is a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.100
very qualified click because they are

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.620
looking for.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.020
The conversion rate is higher than

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.980
if we impact it.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.040
With banner or social media ads

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.140
that will normally be, it's usually

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.140
pretty much listening

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.620
to you, the conclusion is that it's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.100
complicated.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.280
It has a necessary management

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.520
cost, it's not immediate, but

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.660
if you do it well and you're

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.620
well positioned, it's very beneficial

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.860
because you'll be getting

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.080
free traffic as a wonder.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.360
You can be years.
