00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.050
One of the main skills or competencies

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.450
that a entrepreneur, or really

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.250
any entrepreneur, or

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.450
even anyone, should have,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.910
is to be able to communicate

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.070
or sell well your project

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.770
or your business.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.110
In this case, I am not talking

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.070
about selling it to potential

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.070
customers.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.590
We are not talking about marketing

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.290
in this case.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.230
We are talking about selling it to the ecosystem.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.730
What do I mean by this?

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.530
You can find a potential investor,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.610
a journalist, etc.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.410
It really acquires the ability to communicate

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.750
in an attractive way and that your

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.150
project or your company is well understood

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.470
to the rest of the world, basically.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.310
And what I want you to keep in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.750
mind is that you will put this into

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
practice on a daily basis, permanently.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.170
Even at any stage of the company,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.230
from the moment the idea comes

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.350
to your head the first day and you

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.630
want to convince a friend of yours

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.450
because you want to be the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.750
co-founder, for example, or if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.170
want to tell your family and they

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.150
think you're not crazy, until you

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.130
have a company that has 300

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.690
employees and bills a lot of millions

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.230
and you want to raise money

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.370
from a venture capital

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.510
or want to sell it, for example.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.970
As it is, it's a skill you'

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.610
ll always use,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.470
regardless of the stage you'

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.110
re in.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.630
And another thing you have to keep

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.710
in mind is that it's very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.770
important, it's vital.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.610
The impact that it really has to be

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.950
able to communicate well is enormous,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.410
because permanently if you are doing

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.410
well you will be opening doors

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.710
or opportunities and if

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.350
you are doing bad you will be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.070
closing them and I tell you it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950
for personal experience.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.490
We receive, it is an example, but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.950
we receive very many proposals for

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.890
projects for different reasons,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.670
because they want us to value

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.150
the investment or because they

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.550
want advice for thousands

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.770
of reasons.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.450
Well, I tell you that the difference

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.490
between receiving a proposal,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.770
it does not matter whether it is by

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.670
email, in a presentation, on a LinkedIn,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.170
on a personal level, in a phone

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.510
call, it does not matter.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.610
The difference between the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.450
project being well communicated,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.190
being easy to understand, being

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.350
worth it, etc., being no effort

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.130
to understand it, being aesthetic.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.930
The difference between that, on

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.950
the contrary, is that you directly

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.050
pay attention or don't pay attention.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.710
And you also have to remember that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.710
really learning to do it right

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.510
is easy.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.830
We will learn in the next

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.550
few days.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.170
We will learn to make learning the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.010
structure that must be followed.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.550
It is easy.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.850
The complicated thing is that you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.830
have an interesting project,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.630
that your business really

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.210
is invertible, that it is scalable, etc.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.790
That's the hard thing, but

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.030
learning to communicate well

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.650
is much easier.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.830
So we have to make the effort,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.730
because as I said, the impact

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.610
will be huge.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.250
The next point is that we

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.650
have to be aware of what

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.770
we have to work on.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.050
We have to learn the goal.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.230
The general goal is to learn how

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.470
to communicate or sell our project

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.710
better in different circumstances.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.730
What are these circumstances?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.390
What is it we have to work on?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.070
I have categorized them in

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.910
four mainly, which we will

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.170
go learning to do each of them.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.170
I think we have to be able

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.550
to have a good pitch of the elevator

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.370
presencial.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.630
That is, we must be able to communicate

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.110
in an attractive and verbal,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.570
indirect way, our

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.490
project.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.370
This is often called the elevator

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.130
pitch or the elevator pitch.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.090
We may be talking about

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.150
different circumstances, it can

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.510
be longer or shorter, but we

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.990
have to have that ability.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.910
When will we use it?

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.210
All the day.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.990
You will use it all

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.570
day long.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.230
You'll be telling your project thousands

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.170
of times, informally, at a dinner with

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.110
friends, when they introduce you to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.650
someone, or at a meeting, a supplier

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.570
arrives at the office, or a potential

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.450
collaborator, or someone you want

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.050
to hire, or you're at

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.150
a networking event, or you'

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.370
re presented with a potential

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.510
investor.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.590
You will have to constantly communicate

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.630
your project.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.690
You have to know how to do it

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.810
well, you have to have the structure

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.970
well prepared, the message

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.030
and structure in your head,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.710
to do it naturally, to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.950
do it attractively, etc.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.930
This is the elevator pitch.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.010
We also have to write

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.050
an elevator pitch.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.810
That in the background is very similar

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.670
to the previous one, but in writing

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.010
you will use it many times.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.450
You send an email, or for example

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.730
in your LinkedIn profile in many

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.130
occasions, we should have an elevator

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.750
pitch, or maybe a one liner or

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.170
a short paragraph, one or several

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.530
phrases in which what we are

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.650
doing is communicate in an

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.010
attractive way our project.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.810
And it has to follow the same

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.010
structure as the elevator pitch,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.330
which we will learn.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.690
One of the things that many people

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.150
are concerned about is the pitch

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.770
deck.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.990
This is the presentation.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.590
It is sometimes called a pitch deck and sometimes

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.330
it is called a deck.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.570
It is actually the presentation, which

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.870
is sometimes known as a business

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.590
plan.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.290
We will have to work very

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.170
well on this.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.050
We'll leave you several templates in

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.350
PowerPoint so you can directly pick

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.550
them up, adapt them, etc.,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.550
because I think that helps

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.410
a lot.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.370
One of the important parts here is that

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.710
it is very aesthetic.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.710
When will we use it?

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.330
You will use it on

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.350
many occasions.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.330
You will use it, you will send

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.530
it, you will send it because you will

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.870
be asked for it thousands of times,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.690
and you will also have to

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.430
present it live.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.610
Imagine I put you in two circumstances.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.370
You have to go to a meeting

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.870
with potential investors.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.990
Well, because your thing is that you take

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.050
the presentation on the computer to

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.530
project what it is and you will

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.830
have to present it yourself.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.010
Sometimes you will have to...

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.950
This presentation will be

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.890
accompanied by your presence and other

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.170
times what you will do is directly send it.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.150
Finally, you should also work

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.890
out some financial projections.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.330
This makes more sense when you

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.470
have a certain traction.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.130
At first, the numerical part of

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.870
the business plan really I think

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.490
is not very important because

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.850
to start with no one will believe

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.070
it.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.150
Because usually the projections

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.030
you make, you will have

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.590
to review them constantly.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.470
But it is good that you are able

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.950
to generate financial projections

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.790
that demonstrate some financial knowledge,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.030
that they are not excessively

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.710
shitty and that they also make

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.910
you understand a little better

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.130
where you want to get.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.750
As we have seen, they are...

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.550
We will work on four possible circumstances

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.130
or four supports and in all of

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.350
them what we have to work on

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.350
is the...

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.490
We need to work on aesthetics,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.790
especially in the presentation.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.430
We have to work on the structure,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.850
the script, we're going to learn

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.730
how to do it and we're going to work

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.270
on the content, which is what you're

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.610
going to communicate.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.930
And finally, what I'm going to give

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.930
you now is a series of tips that

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.570
are what kind of content you should

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.710
include, how you should

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.070
relate to investors in general.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.430
And that they are advice that you

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.790
should apply to all these

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.090
circumstances that we have seen, to

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.730
all these supports.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.670
And they are advice that starts

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.330
from our professional experience

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.490
and are advice that starts from

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.470
the criteria that investors have.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.050
The first of them, remember that

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.510
investors always say they invest

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.650
in people, invest in the team,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.910
they'll care almost more about

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.030
who you are and why your

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.050
project.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.050
Therefore, you have to give much importance

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.930
to this, you have to put in value

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.670
who you are, you have to put

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.790
in value the team and an important

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.370
topic and a advice is that you

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.210
talk about your story, that

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.190
you value the storytelling, that

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.130
you tell why, that you tell why

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.150
you have decided to mount

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.050
that project, why, what is what

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.170
has led you to it, that you open

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.890
up so that the investor understands

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.350
you, understand why you are

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.450
deciding to do this, what

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.830
are your motivations.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.990
Another important thing is to remember

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.970
that the size of the market is very important.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.050
You have in mind that in this world

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.210
we mainly talk about investors

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.190
who seek high returns

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.290
and who assume high risks.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.910
So they are looking for projects

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.770
in which they can revaluate

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.790
their investment, multiply

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.010
it, for example, by 10.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.110
So you have to make him dream,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.970
you have to think big.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.490
You have in mind that the projects

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.810
in which you will grow little

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.990
in the coming years are projects

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.050
that may get funding elsewhere,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.410
in a bank, for example, but

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.590
are not interesting projects

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.110
for this type of professional

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.990
investors in the world

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.070
of startups.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.330
So you have to think big, you

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.210
have to delude the investor,

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.290
because otherwise it won'

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.950
t go in.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.790
You have to think big, but

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.590
you have to be very realistic.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.830
I have often said that one of the

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.370
main mistakes that entrepreneurs

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.370
make is that they fall in love

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.470
with their idea and lose objectivity

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.150
and are unable to identify

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.930
the risks.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.830
You have to remember that your

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.310
perspective and that of the investor

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.350
is completely different, it

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.410
is radically different.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.250
The investor has seen thousands

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.250
of projects like yours that in the

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.770
vast majority have failed or have not

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.670
come or have done.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.230
You are in love with your idea, you

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.550
perceive that there is no risk, that

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.150
you will succeed, and the investor

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.950
sees it from a completely

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.610
different perspective.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.570
Therefore, it is convenient that you

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.390
be realistic, that you are able to

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.490
identify the risks and that you are

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.650
transparent with this.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.450
Why is?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.890
Because if the investor perceives that

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.010
you do not have that ability, that

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.770
you have lost objectivity, you will

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.390
awaken many alarms in the investor.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.670
Another advice is to be

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.510
absolutely honest, very transparent

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.050
and very honest in what you are

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.110
good, in what you are bad, because

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.310
this makes you connect much

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.210
better with the investor or

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.630
with your interlocutor in

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.870
any circumstance.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.050
When we are sincere, transparent

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.070
and direct, we connect

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.370
much better, when we take away

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.650
the caretaps.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.010
In addition, keep in mind, as I

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.630
told you, that the investor

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.650
almost develops, professional

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.590
investors have developed almost

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.230
a superpower and they are able

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.070
to see a lot more, because they

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.830
have seen a lot of entrepreneurs,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:46.690
they have seen a lot

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.290
of projects.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.310
Therefore, it is best that you expose

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.450
yourself in a very natural, very direct

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.770
and very sincere way.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.490
And finally, as long as you can

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.050
teach the product, as long as

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.850
you can, the more you can

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.530
tangibly tangible the facts than

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.370
the words.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.430
So, if you can carry a model,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.570
if you can carry a demo, everything

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.570
you can demonstrate helps

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.090
a lot to decrease risk

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.230
perception.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.230
If you go to an investor with a power

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.410
point, that's just an idea you put

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.250
on a presentation, because

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.050
the perception of risk is much

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.770
bigger than if you've worked

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.790
on the product, than if you

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.290
can teach something.
