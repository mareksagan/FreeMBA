00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.860
Cris, I would like to analyze the

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.560
remuneration or remuneration of

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.280
employees.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.040
Basically what we give them,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.000
explained in a simple way.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.600
The first thing to remember

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.560
is that the salary goes beyond

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.200
the money.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.040
People think you're well paid, you're

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.080
going to be motivated and you're going

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.620
to perform well.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.800
Wage is a more than

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.840
a concept.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.300
That is, it is a package that

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.440
is made up of an economic remuneration,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.260
but then there are motivational

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.700
factors beyond the economic ones.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.320
I have said this because we

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.880
usually think of pay as equal

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.120
to money.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.320
That is.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.980
Money is a hygienic factor.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.220
People give it for granted.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.960
People think that when they ask

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.040
for a pay increase, that won't

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.800
motivate them in the long run.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.280
It will motivate you maybe short-term,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.680
but very short, because in a short

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.880
time you will have forgotten,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.660
they will have taken it as a right acquired

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.020
and will ask you for another

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.900
salary increase.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.260
I read this years ago and it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.280
surprised me a lot.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.640
Money is not motivating.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.840
not motivated.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.020
And people say, it can't be.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.060
And we also have many examples.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.540
That is.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.940
That is, what really motivates motivational

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.340
factors are, for example,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.840
that there is a career plan

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.000
or a development opportunity.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.540
It is that the employee feels that

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.060
he shares the company's vision and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.900
mission.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.240
It is that the employee has

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.640
opportunities to form with a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.860
Master of MBA or specific formations.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.460
This is the possibility that the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.640
employee can reconcile.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.200
That is the emotional factor, the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.320
emotional salary.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.240
Indeed, if we think, there are sectors

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.420
in which people make a lot of money,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.520
that those emotional factors,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.800
in many cases, because they do not

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.420
give and people are very dissatisfied.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.280
actually is.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.960
Likewise, sometimes the job is still

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.800
stuck, I think, almost because

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.140
it has become accustomed to an

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.900
economic level that forces it to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.880
keep on that wheel.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.740
But that does not guarantee you as an

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.360
entrepreneur a good performance.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.360
In the end, this employee is not motivated.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.360
He's there because he wants to maintain his

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.020
standard of living, but he's not motivated.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.300
You are unhappy or dismotivated,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.520
so you probably don't do your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.320
job very well.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.440
I am thinking of an extreme case.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.520
I think that the air controllers

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.860
who went on strike years

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.700
ago earned 200,000 euros

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400
and worked very

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.460
few days a month.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.620
This is an extreme case, but it is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.660
very representative of this.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.940
Money doesn't motivate because

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000
they've been used to winning.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.820
I don't know, 200,000 euros I don't know,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.260
but they were no longer motivated.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.360
Now we will analyze within the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.060
remuneration or wage, of the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.080
purely economic remuneration,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.340
what are the formulas that

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.520
a company has.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.060
In addition, it is good to know them

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.980
all because when you set the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.400
packages, the offer, you have

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.360
more things to play with if we have

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.040
visibility.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.300
You have a fixed salary

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.200
based on a job.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.220
The position you will be in an

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.600
organization, you are paid a salary.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.000
In addition, that salary may vary

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.860
depending on your experience or what

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.220
the candidate provides.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.540
First of all, you have to keep in mind

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.720
that the market is paying,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.320
because you may make an economic

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.500
offer, but the market is paying

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.600
twice as much.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.540
That in the end will not bring talent,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.660
because you get your competition,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.760
offer the double and you have created

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.820
yourself without talent.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.160
Effectively the market conditiones

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.520
everything, because if you

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.920
want to pay, now for example,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.020
professionals, developers

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.680
and others are in high demand.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.100


00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.780
The digital profiles.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.280
The digital profiles.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.840
And you have to fit the market, regardless

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.120
of what you want to pay for.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.640
You have no access to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.980
that talent.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.300
actually is.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.940
That would be the fixed

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.800
salary.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.840
And then there is what we call

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.900
business incentives, which

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.260
is also economic remuneration,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.820
usually short-term.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.780
They are usually monthly or quarterly.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.120
They are based on commercial

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.740
objectives.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.280
Based on sales, civilization,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.040
the consumer or customer

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.920
experience.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.480
And they are goals that are set

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.200
in a clear and smart way, as we

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.000
have seen in previous classes, but

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.220
that also encourage the achievement

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.620
of those goals in a quarterly

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.280
and purely economic manner.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.020
Here really the possibility of,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.560
not only are sales, but if we

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.780
start to analyze sector by sector,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.860
by telephony, such, the variables

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.460
that are used are endless.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.160
Every system is a world.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.340
Here what I want to share, and we

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.380
have all lived it as consumers,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.940
is that in many cases this

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.680
system of commercial incentives

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.460
in the end, if not done well,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.980
ends up generating a bad

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.160
customer experience.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.800
Why is it?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.640
Imagine that we only incentivize

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.080
the trading force based,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.180
for example, on total sales.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.740
We forget about retention, we forget

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.340
about customer experience like

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.260
NPS, we forget about metrics

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.340
that are representative

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.660
of that trade is generating

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.800
value to the customer.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.180


00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.360
Imagine that we only encourage

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.080
for the high nodes, for example.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.220
In the end, people who are human

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.420
will only think about what you

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.400
are encouraging them, and the customer

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.520
experience will give you the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.020
same.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.140
But it would happen to all of us the same.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.400
At the end of the day, you have

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.840
to consider goals, both operational

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.640
and strategic, to not lose focus

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
on the company's vision

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.540
and mission.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.080
In order not to fall, in effect, to

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.340
misrepresent the objectives a little.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.980
For example, I am talking

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.020
about telephone

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.160
sales.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.640
We have done a lot of projects with

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.020
this distribution channel.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.840
And at the end, when you landed

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.700
at the point of sale, the goals...

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.120
The incentive system

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.100
was very complex.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.620
But in the end, the commercials who

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.840
were at that point of sale only thought

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.340
about that and were generating

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.460
up to, I don't know how to tell

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.480
you, almost permanent trichomonas

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.620
because everyone thought was

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.620
their goal, their variable.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.740
But they didn't think that the customer

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.480
who entered the door would come

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.280
out there with a smile.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.800
It is therefore an example of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.200
strategic objectives being disalloyed

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.240
with the objectives that

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.980
were set to the trade force.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.180
That is.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.060
This is about commercial incentives.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.480
Then there is another part of the salary

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.020
or the pay offer, which is the

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.640
bonus.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.020
The bonus is generally an

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.080
annual salary and depends on

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.460
the achievement of company goals

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.000
at the global level.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.040
The business incentives are at the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.360
individual level, the bonus, bonus,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.280
is at the company level.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.720
And this is set a percentage

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.300
based on the job position that

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.540
each employee has in the

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.360
organization and that can

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.400
go from a 5% of the company's

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.460
results to your salary.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.360
That is.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.060
That's a percentage of your salary.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.900
And it can go from

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.160
5% to lower positions

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.620
in the app to 45% for managers.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.400
This is basically you X, 40,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.000
000 euros and you will charge

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.780
an additional 20% in case

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.600
we a growth in sales

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.440
of 10 or 12% next year.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.980
20% of your salary.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.140
With your salary, that is.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.420
On top of your salary.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.940
I am thinking about sectors that are

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.000
highly service-oriented.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.940
We will think of strategic consultancy

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.140
or investment banking,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.800
etc.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.400
That everyone in the pyramid has

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.260
very high bonds that up to 50%,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.700
of course, because even if they

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.660
are large companies they are like

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.620
micro-enterprises with a very concrete

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.900
and very variable income account.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.800
That is, depending on whether these

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.060
5 people work more or less,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.260
many millions of euros can be

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.640
billed.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.300
You are encouraging that the whole

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.880
organization, the bonus, what it

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.540
gets is that everyone feels almost

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.200
partner.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.500
That is, partisans, who in the end

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.000
feel the company as theirs.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.620
In the end, everything

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.900
we get is shared.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.400
Just as the commercial incentive you

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.300
think more about yourself and it's

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.920
fine because it encourages you

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.980
to do your job better, the bonus

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.060
is a bit different, it has a

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.020
more emotional value, right?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.240
It is more emotional, it is more

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.540
focused on culture, the company

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.540
on the bond it generates, the commitment

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.520
that is generated between employer

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.600
and employee by being part

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.980
of a single vision.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.960
Of course, because what is terrible

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.060
is that you have a job where no matter

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.360
what you do well, bad, the company

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.020
goes well covers the same, because

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.460
that is the most discouraging thing

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.020
in the world, because then you say

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.040
I am not the owner of my successes

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.060
if the company turns out that this

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.320
year has gone great we have earned

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.620
a lot of millions I will continue

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.400
the same?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.600
The bonus is that at the end of

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.120
the year everyone usually participates

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.820
in some percentage of that

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.360
success.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.380
Of course, the bonus is a

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.640
very important motivational element.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.440
And then there is the remuneration

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.640
in a flexible kind and that is already

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.980
very varied, but here within this

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.940
field is the training in the master

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.040
or MBA from the checks restaurant

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.140
or kindergarten checks from the

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.720
subject of medical insurance

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.480
for you and your family to the

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.980
pensions plans or life insurance.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.440


00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.980
That's kind of remuneration that's called

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.440
or also called flexible remuneration

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.180
because it depends on the employee

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.660
on what motivates him or her or

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.060
she has no access to a type of

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.040
remuneration.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.640
This is like a sasher cage in which

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.880
we put everything according to the

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.720
interests of each employee and for

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.980
example if I in my company have

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.200
the possibility to opt for kindergarten

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.020
checks and as a mother of a baby

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.920
I am interested, then it is

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.340
a part of the salary in kind

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.940
so to speak that it gives me.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.560
You have called it flexible and I

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.120
like it more because what it really

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.100
helps you is to adapt the offer

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.820
to the needs of each of the employees.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.520
Need or interests or motivations

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.460
in the light of you as a company

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.040
what you have to see is because the

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.880
range is as wide as possible

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.100
in such a way that it covers a lot

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.760
of diverse interests in such

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.300
a way that a person who hears that

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.920
their motivation is to be conciliated

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.640
because he hears you have the option

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.120
of a childcare check or flexible

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.320
payrolls as regards arrangements

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.040
and others.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.960
If you give me a check

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960
or a paper jet.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.200
Logically but maybe you motivate you

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.780
because you are paid a master's degree

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.060
or one motivates you because having

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.940
a life insurance insurance for your

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.600
family when this person is missing

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.000
because your family or medical insurance

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.300
for example for my family the case

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.180
is to have a very varied offer

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.320
so that your offer your proposal

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.940
is as complete as possible and

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.020
in addition and that will

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.460
allow you to bring better talent.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.660
Effectively adapt to the needs

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.160
of each I will comment here to finish

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.580
that here I think we could put the

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.660
stock options that are in the startups

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.660
environment are usual we will

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.160
think of companies that are growing

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.260
a lot that imagine that they are

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.460
equally capitalized or are

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.460
not investing a lot in growth

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.080
and then the salaries the

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.960
fixed for example are

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.200
low what happens is that

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.080
what attracts talent is to be able

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.480
to participate in that plus value

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.160
that will be generated at

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.020
some point of the company value

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.000
then you what you do is offer

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.240
to someone good because here in

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.420
three years a plan of stock

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.240
options in which you will go

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.780
winning stock options and within

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.100
three years and I also get

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.400
faithful so you will have a

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.500
percentage of company this I

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.920
imagine that I know not know

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.720
what the percentage is equal

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.880
and if one day we do a success

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.860
and we sell it because the

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.700
other founders will be

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.700
and you will take you a p

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.560
Another more flexible option because

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.080
in this case they are companies

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.820
that are not willing to pay such high

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.080
salaries and what they do is

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.980
offer it in this way.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.920
Well, you have explained fixed and

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.780
variables that are commercial

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.280
incentives or bonuses and then

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.700
a broad offer of more flexible

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.420
that allows you to adapt I think

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.140
that what people have to

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.280
do is to know them all from

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.780
there to create the offers

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.860
from all that knowledge.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.040
Music is
