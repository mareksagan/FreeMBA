00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.070
I would like to explain

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.630
why we always consider

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.770
conversions vital.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.410
Look, on the one hand, think

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.610
the following, really we do what

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.470
we do is in digital marketing,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.150
you make an investment, you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.630
spend money on attracting

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.650
traffic on top.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.090
That's the fate of your investment

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.630
that can be in different ways as you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.110
already know.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.770
Well, the key to getting a greater

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.610
or lesser return on that investment

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.170
already depends on the bottom

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.050
and depends on the conversion.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.410
In addition, it is that you think one

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.370
thing, all companies are very easy to

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.750
attract traffic, it is almost a matter

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.190
of money and the key is, the competitive

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.390
advantage is in convincing your

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.650
customers better than the competition

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.430
because there you will generate

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.710
a competitive advantage.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.670
Keep in mind the following, companies

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.590
what we do is invest in

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.410
many different campaigns,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.730
channels, we are constantly

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.030
testing.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.310
And there are some that go well, the numbers

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.470
go out, they are profitable

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.810
and others are not.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.050
But of course, this depends a lot

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.730
on conversions, if you are excellent

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.810
converting, if your entire conversion

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.030
funnel is absolutely optimized,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.550
each message attacks the customer

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.190
concerns, you have designed the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.010
right touch points, etc.,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.770
and you become better than the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.810
others, you will be able to allow

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.170
yourself to invest in many more

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.610
channels and more aggressively.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.390
That's what will generate you,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.850
a greater growth than others, you have

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.630
more reach, you can grow more, you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.550
will catch momentum and it's possible

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.710
that you end up generating even

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.650
entry barriers.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.410
That's why you have to obsess conversion,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.390
attracting traffic is very easy,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.430
that's what anyone can

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.990
do, converting well is

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.890
much harder.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.610
And on the other hand, managing

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.970
conversion ratios well, measuring

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.910
them permanently, keeping them

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.070
in mind and being part

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.370
of the CO and CMO concerns, etc.,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.830
is a good starting point

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.810
for making decisions.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.370
Why is it?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.530
Because conversion rates are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.630
very good indicators of the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.510
business health and our value

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.430
proposition and are really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.570
very good indicators

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.330
of customer behavior.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.910
You have one thing in mind and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.310
we have seen it on other occasions

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.630
when we talked about In Startup,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.610
for example, you think that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.970
you are managing aggregated

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.390
indicators.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.650
Last month we had 8,000 leads and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.590
this month we have 10,000.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.650
Well, that is well.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.750
You have to grow up like that, right?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.370
But it is more important or more representative

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.830
of whether you do things well or badly

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.570
that you are measuring, for

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.270
example, the percentage

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.490
of leads on visits because the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.970
ratio is representative of that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330
those visits convince them what

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.250
you tell them or not.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.790
Do you understand the difference?

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.270
The numbers can be added.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.130
We have more leads, we have more leads.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.290
It's okay, but the ratio is what

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.290
tells us whether the new messages

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.610
we're incorporating into the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.390
website, the developments of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.290
our value proposal are in good

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.570
line or not.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.290
Well, finally, I want you to know

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.370
that there are really very few companies,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.070
we've known very few companies

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.390
that do this well.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.390
In fact, there are thousands of

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.390
people who are experts in digital

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.390
marketing, in Google Analytics,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.810
in Analytica, etc., but companies

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.370
that are really optimizing their

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.490
conversions and are working

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.830
this as we propose to be done,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.190
there are very few and there

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.350
are very common mistakes.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.750
For example, many companies do

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.690
what they do is obsess with more

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.710
traffic and forget about conversions.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.130
So, there are many responsibilities

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.750
to generate more traffic.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.570
But there are few people who

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.190
are thinking they are really obsessed

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.730
with optimizing conversions.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.130
And that will be of course.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.030
Another common mistake is that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.370
even companies that are, which

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.010
monitor conversions, what

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.570
they do is measure, that

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.490
is, what they do is fix on

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.010
the most quantitative information.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.290
For example, they know about Analytica,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.750
and they have a dashboard with a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.690
lot of information, etc.,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.930
but they forget about the client.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.430
They forget the pigs.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.710
They are not able to gain

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.830
insights, to understand why,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.270
the reason for those metrics.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.950
That is the real difference.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.130
That is the value.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.030
The value of analytics, the value

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.170
of conversions, is not to have quantitative

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.490
information.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.230
What you need to do is understand

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.810
what is happening, the customer'

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.610
s why, because so you can

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.330
make the decisions that make

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.890
the conversion ratings start.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.740
Another common mistake is that

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.150
companies, in some cases, initially,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.870
for example, you launch

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.030
the website, etc., are

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.630
concerned about conversions.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.210


00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.690
But only initially, that is, they did

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.170
not assimilate the concept of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.310
permanent optimization.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.950
Optimization is a permanent

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.590
obsession.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.450
You have to be constantly thinking

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.230
about how to improve your

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.430
messages, how to impact the customer

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.510
better, how to improve

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.850
engagement with your customer

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.950
to increase conversion

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.490
rates throughout the entire funnel.
