WEBVTT

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.820
If we draw, we will draw the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.860
business model canvas, we start

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.920
with the customer segments

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160
and what you offer to each of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.600
the customer segments.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.560
I think there are two segments of customers

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.920
that are, like any marketplace, in this

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.740
case you have the brands, I don't

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.020
know if you call them brands or

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.920
companies or I don't know.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.860
The clothing marks.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.240
Brands and Users.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
You offer them additional business,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.220
I understand.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.260
And the users, well, because you offer them.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.460
What do users offer?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.360
What is the main value?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.940
There are two types of users, I know.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.220
Yes, that is, I think, as we

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.920
divide it, it is to make a more

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.600
intersection between users.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.620
We divided them into two.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540
You have the most content creators

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.440
users, as it is in any social network,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.140
Twitter, Instagram, everywhere,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.900
where you have those who normally

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.660
upload photos and then you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.920
have users who see content

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.620
and who buy, right?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.080
Then you have the marks.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.740
This is a win-win model for

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.940
all three stakeholders.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.280
Why is?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.620
Because you have users who

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.760
want to buy content and see trends.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.880
You give them a product that no one

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.960
is offering.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.380
You have then some users where they

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.220
don't have another platform, where

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.440
they can monetize their trends, their

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
theft, etc., and more.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.600
You can go up whatever you want, right?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.860
I actually painted it the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.700
same way.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.920
By calling it otherwise, you allow

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.020
creators to foster their personal

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.860
brand and make money, right?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.720
And the rest you can buy.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.320
and exact.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.040
And we bring them to the marks.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.100
For very simple marks.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.960
Traffic and mobile.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.580
But that's like any marketplace,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.840
you offer an additional business

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.260
and such, highly qualified, etc.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.600
Well, you're offering sales

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.880
through network content users,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.440
who are now losing a lot

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.460
of those sales.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.860
Yes, it is very well.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.480
One thing I think of is that there

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.780
are social networks that focus

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.620
on content, such as YouTube,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.720
where the creator and consumer

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.160
profiles are absolutely

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.100
different.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.820
There are two worlds.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.300
There are people who upload videos and there

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.220
are people who consume them.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.520
And there are other social networks,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.500
which you have put an example,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.160
such as Facebook or Twitter, where

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.960
those profiles are...

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.580
It is true that there are people who

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.500
are more content creators than others,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.300
but that it is almost more a topic of

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.700
use than of profile.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.720
I do not know how it is.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.000
No, in the end everyone can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.320
upload photos, everyone can

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.880
buy, everyone can see.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.800
Although it seems to us that on Twitter

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.240
everyone can do everything, there

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.840
are two super-differentiated

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.320
segments and that's a lot of

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.020
articles that talk about it.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040
Yes, on Facebook, but not

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.100
on Twitter.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.940
More and less on Facebook.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.340
That is, if you look, you go to your

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.820
Facebook feed, you have more and more,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.960
that is, you have fewer people hanging

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.240
more content from those people.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.280
Why is?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.020
People use one

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.060
or two tools.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.580
Now what is most working is Instagram

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.100
and it is true that it is

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.820
mixed a lot in the part of Instagram.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.300
Many people publish stories, many people

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.380
consume stories and that barrier

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.600
is less clear.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.340
And in your case, how is it?

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.440
In this case, there are two

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.140
types of users.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.240
There are people who say I won't take

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.740
a photo with my outfit because

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.800
it makes me ashamed or because I don'

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.860
t have time.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.080
Of course, because you add the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.120
buttons so people buy you,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.060
that's done for an economic reason.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.200
No, most of them upload it for

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.060
a social recognition reason

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.040
or because it gives them the desire

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.080
to upload photos.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.820
As you do on Instagram, there is no other

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.720
difference.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.560
Yes, but they make money when

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.940
someone buys on those links.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.800
Do you earn money?

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.460
Yes, it is true, they make money

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.700
because we are democratizing that

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.620
selling power in that sense.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.100
Because if a user is selling

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.500
thanks to it, why shouldn'

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.100
t that user be charged

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.280
a commission?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.960
We could quantify it a little, I understand

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.980
not much, but I understand

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.720
that within 21 buttons there are

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.380
people who make a lot of money because

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.200
they are people who are really

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.900
real influencers, especially girls.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.300
There are more people who make

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.040
money, really.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.360
On Instagram today, money can be

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.960
earned by someone who can have

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.160
a manager, have a business relationship

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.780
with brands, agencies,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.500
etc.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.920
This is in the hands of very few people.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.240
In the pyramid, the value proposition

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.560
from the perspective of one of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.020
the values is to make money.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.160
And on Instagram the pyramid is a pyramid

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.460
in which only the cuspide earns money

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.520
and there are people who make a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.540
lot of money, but they are only

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.200
very few.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.000
and exact.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.960
YouTube is the extreme case because

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.360
it is complicated to make a

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.480
YouTube video, do it well...

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.440
Of course, the barrier is

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.000
even bigger.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.340
In Instagram, the pyramid is very

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.940
large in terms of people who upload

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.500
content, it is very small in

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.880
terms of people who make money.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.100
Because it's not that Instagram

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.820
pays you that barrier, you need to

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.960
break it by reaching agreements with brands.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.620
In contrast, on Twitter and

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.640
Instagram the pyramid is what it

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.840
is, where it could be between

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.560
a Twitter and an Instagram, but where

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.240
everyone monetizes its influence,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.760
not just that small part

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.600
of the pyramid.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.080
Everyone monetizes their influence.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.360
There are people who will earn very

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.000
little money.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.980
Of course, it depends on you,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.220
it's totally meritocratic.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.320
You try to have more followers on

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.700
your profiles, you try to recommend

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.860
it to more people and you will

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.840
earn more money.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.220
It is meritocratic in that sense.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.820
Well, we have perfectly drawn

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.000
the customer segments and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.060
customer segments we have said...

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.140
And then we have the users, which are

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.540
two profiles, which are the most

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.940
creative and the most consuming.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.340
The most creative people are offered

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.560
a value that is that they earn more

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.940
money, enhance their personal

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.660
brand, etc.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.320
And you offer consumers the consumption

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.380
of such attractive content.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.520
And the challenge is, that in your case

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.060
you have achieved it, and it is

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.400
an advantage over the rest of social

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.000
networks, the challenge is that

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.460
in your case it is more mixed, not

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.080
so extreme, the percentage of those

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.520
who create and earn money, but you

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.820
have managed to democratize it.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.180
and exact.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.640
It is a challenge to think about creating

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.520
a social network.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.620
In fact, I would recommend that if

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.200
someone is going to raise investment

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.700
in initial rounds, don't put it as a

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.400
social network.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.540
That's the same thing you're saying,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.440
I've told you, I've commented on people

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.580
who tell me, that I'm not going to

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.600
build a social network and not say

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.760
a social network, because I've thrown

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.120
people back, because of course, it's

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.920
an ultra-ambitious project.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.700
We put on a social network.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.180
Within the DNA of the company

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.940
and the company culture, it is

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.660
to be super transparent with

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.840
all stakeholders, with

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.540
employees, with investors,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.540
with everyone.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.080
So what is a social network?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.720
We are a social network, we will be able to do it.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.560
That someone doesn't want to invest in

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.080
this company because it has social

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.140
networking factors?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.600
That doesn't invest.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.260
We don't want people inside

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.680
the company who don't share

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.840
our vision.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.880
Because if not, what happens is

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.320
that they become companies where

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.260
you have a management, either

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.680
through the board, or through the

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.580
people you have inside working

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.520
in the company, which go in

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.620
different lines.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.920
And that is where the problems arise.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.480
Social networking is more marketplace.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.720
Perfect, very well explained.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.620
Many thanks.
