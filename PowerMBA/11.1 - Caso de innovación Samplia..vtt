WEBVTT

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.980
Finally, I will do a strategic

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.600
analysis of Samplia’s business

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.540
model and what the benefits

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.820
this innovation

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.340
has generated.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.540
Point number one.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.600
Robert was from Publifilms, which

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.060
is an agency business, a linear

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.020
business in which it was very difficult

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.200
to grow, very little scalable because

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.940
it depends on resources that

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.160
are mainly people.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.020
Well, as you move from a linear

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.520
business to a platform at the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
moment and connect users with

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.820
brands through, as we have seen,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.080
two channels, which are machines

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.880
and the application.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.740
Point number one.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.240
It has created a platform with

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.380
the benefits in the business model

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.460
that you already know has

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.260
a platform, mainly, that generates

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.360
entry barriers, network

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.700
effect, etc.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.120
Okay, but let’s go to the details.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.980
The reality is that Robert combines

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.600
two business models and are two

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.860
very profitable business models

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.760
that also have synergies between them.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.840
One of.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200
Machines generate a profitability

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.820
because brands do it to hire

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.300
quincennal campaigns

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.000
on those machines.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.140
Not only do they generate

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.100
a profit, but these machines

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.620
are also allowing you to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.520
capture thousands of new users

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280
for your app every day, because

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.320
all the people you’ve seen

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.260
running the machine’s

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.540
queue to access their sample,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.800
their free product, have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440
to download the app.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.900
and additionally.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.380
Machines generate entry barriers

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.620
for your business, because you have

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.040
in mind that he already has the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340
best points of sale, in particular

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.360
the best shopping centers

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.040
in Spain and every time he grows,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.960
placing new machines in new

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.580
points, be it shopping centers

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.300
or whatever, he is generating

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.980
entry barriers because

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.300
they are long-term agreements.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.120


00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.840
They are protecting your business.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.980
Now let’s go to the business

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.440
model he talked about that

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.540
had digitized users, which

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.940
is related to the app.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.540
At the time you already have

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.740
users in the app, which already has

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.500
half a million, you can make money

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.020
and do so by connecting brands with

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.300
users, but through the application,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.420
no longer through the machine,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.640
because brands are willing to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.200
pay campaigns, to offer virtual

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.040
samples, push notifications,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.120
there are different ways to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.460
do so, but the issue is that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.680
it expands, earns money with

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.960
those 500 thousand users

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.400
that you have, which grow

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.060
every day.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.160
It is one of the most

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.260
downloaded apps in Spain

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.040
every day.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.300
And I’m going to go to the last point and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.540
it’s something that’s not very obvious, but

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.620
that’s the magic of sampling.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.520
I explain to you.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.440
All companies, let’s think

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.960
of all the apps that they

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.100
do is monetize their user

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.760
base, whatever the way it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.240
is.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.860
They have usually had to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.580
invest in marketing to capture

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.420
those users.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.380
Each user has a cost of acquisition.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.240
The point is that first you have to invest

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.660
and then you make a profit for

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.240
those users.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.160
That is normal.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.200
But the case of sampling, as the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.260
magic of sampling said, is that sampling

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.660
has not had to invest a single

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.200
euro to capture those 500,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.020
000 users.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.420
All the opposite.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.240
The machines have helped him

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.000
get all that critical mass, all

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.520
that customer base, but it’s that

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.080
he’s also made money with it.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.360
Brands, when they hire a campaign

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.860
on the machines, are subsidizing

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.160
Samplia to capture

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.960
new users for their application.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.540


00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.420
This means that you are making money

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.740
and capturing new users.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.100
I have not seen this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.140
in any other company.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.780


00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.620
And I think that’s one of the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.760
keys that Samplia doesn’t stop

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.660
growing and that Samplia will

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.060
become a huge and very valuable

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.620
company in very short time.
