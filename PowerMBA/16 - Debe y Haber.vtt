00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.360
In this class I want you to learn

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.980
how movements are noticed in accounting

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.220
accounts.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.100
The account always has that

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.820
structure, right?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.500
It is a T.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.120
The left side is called the deed

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.520
and the right side is called

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.960
the haber.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.520
You have to memorize this.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.280
The complicated thing here is that

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.860
accounts, the different types of

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.820
accounts grow by the must or by the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.220
having.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.080
And that's what I want you to learn today.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.180
Let us see.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.640
Remember that we have accounts that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.540
go to the balance sheet and accounts

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.120
that go to the outcome.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.820
The balance sheet includes the accounts

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.840
of assets, liabilities

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.600
and net assets.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.340
The income and expenditure accounts

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.220
will be transferred to the results.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.380
Here, for example, we have a

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.180
bank account with two notes

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.560
worth 11,000 euros in the debt

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.880
and one for 6,000 in the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.460
having.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.080
Well, the important thing is that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.820
I want you to understand that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600
the asset accounts, look, the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.240
asset accounts are on the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.600
left of the balance sheet.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.160
Each account will work

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.580
the same way.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.600
It will grow on the left

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.500
side, by the debt.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.220
Net and Passive accounts are

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.280
on the right side of the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.160
balance sheet.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.080
They will grow by having.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.380
It's like imitating the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.340
functioning of a balance sheet

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.000
within each of the accounts.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.620
Let's take an example to see

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.280
if it helps.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.100
Let's start with the asset accounts.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.060
Look at the balance sheet.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.700
Where are they?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.780
They are here.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.420
They are on the left, right?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.260
Well, asset accounts grow

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.340
on the left side, grow on

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.160
the debt side.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.060
Let us see.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.680
We have the bank account,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.400
we make one note, we do another,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.780
it grows.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.480
We make another note on the having,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.580
which is a outlet in this case

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.220
of banks, of growth and the

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.520
balance is $5,000.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.680
Where do we have it?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.400
On the left side.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.120
As you can see, left, left.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.140
We are talking about

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.620
net capital, in this case,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.420
net capital.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.520
Where is it?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.840
On the right side.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.880
Where does it grow?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.500
by the having.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.800
We are going to passive accounts.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.880
Where are the passive accounts in the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.360
balance sheet?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.540
You see, here they are, on

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.300
the right, you know.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.560
Where do passive accounts grow

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.060
like this?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.520
They grow by having.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.020
We get a loan, imagine,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.220
a mortgage worth $150,000.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.240
The first year we will get back 20,000.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.460
We have a balance of 130,000.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.580
We take it to balance.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.920
Here we have it.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440
Well, I hope these examples have

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.300
helped you understand why asset

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.720
accounts grow on the side of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.920
debt, on the right, and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.840
why net asset and liability

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.420
accounts grow on the right

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.160
side or on the having

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.780
side.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.250
There are two types of accounts.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.310
The income and expenditure

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.010
accounts used to calculate

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.970
the outcome of the year.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.130
Remember that the result of the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.730
exercise, when we do not share it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.970
among the partners, what it does

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.030
is increase the net worth.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.510
Let us think so.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.800
We have income and expenditure

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.760
accounts.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.060
The difference is the result of the exercise.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580
Therefore, income accounts

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.360
grow by having, they grow by

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.560
the right side, because they

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.260
increase net worth.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.280
The accounting costs are the opposite.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.200
The difference is the result of the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.960
exercise that goes on the right side.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.040
Therefore, it is obvious that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.580
income accounts must grow by having

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.580
and expenditure accounts

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.600
must grow by debt.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.680
Let's see some case.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.200
income from sales.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.760
We sold $6,000 in the have.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.000
The balance is $6,000.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.210
We have a cost of 4,000.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.510
As we see, it grows by having,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.830
the income and expenditure account

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.910
grows by debt.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.670
We have a net profit of

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.790
$2,000 that we will reinvest

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.870
in the company.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.370
The difference, 6,000, 4,000,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.990
is 2,000 to the right, 2,000

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.070
in net worth.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.300
I am aware that this

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.680
mechanism may be complex

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.660
to you.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.440
However, I assure you that once

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.760
you practice it, this is like

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.600
driving.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.000
You learn to drive, at first it costs

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.260
you, but when you have already interiorized

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.520
it, like driving a car, driving

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160
a bike, when you have already

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.680
interiorized it, you get out

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.200
alone.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.020
Thanks for watching the video!
