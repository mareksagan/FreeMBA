00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.400
Value a company using the discount

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.300
cash flow method consists, as

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.820
you can do to the idea, in

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
estimating either the value

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.380
of the company or the value

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.700
of the equity of the own

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.200
funds from the cash flows that

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.760
this company will generate

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.720
in the future.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.180
Therefore, there are basically two steps.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.080
First and then we have to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.160
discount it.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780
Here what I want to introduce you is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.840
that there are different types of

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.940
cash flows that we will study the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.300
most important and depending on whether

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
we choose one type of cash flow

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
or another, which are

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.600
representative of different

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.460
things, we will have to

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.200
discount them at a rate, at a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.700
different cost of capital.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.050
I would like to make a brief

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.710
analysis of what are the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.050
advantages, pros and cons of

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.330
the cash flow discount method

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.670
over the rest.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.710
Let me start with the benefits.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.340
I would like you to be clear that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.800
if we had to choose one method

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.560
we would actually have to choose

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.980
cash flow discount and for

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.620
a number of reasons.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.300
One of them is because it is probably

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.080
the most real.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.940
Real is a very broad word,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.080
but what do I mean by this?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.780
You think one thing, when you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960
buy a business or when you invest

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.840
in a business or an asset, it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.020
doesn't matter in any investment,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.580
in the bottom, what you

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.420
are buying is the hope of getting

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.820
some future cash flows.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.660
You do is commit some current

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.280
cash flows, which is your investment,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.340
with the hope of receiving in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
the future some cash flows

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.300
that can be via dividends,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.680
give me equal or via sale

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.780
of your stake with a plus-

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.600
value, etc.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.820
And it is that this is exactly

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.300
what we will value, what we will

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.220
value is that, is that you

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.220
will actually get or not get those

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.320
future cash flows and at what risk?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.680
It is therefore more oriented

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080
to the real interests or the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.860
real goals of the buyer.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.360
Benefit number two.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.780
With the cash flow discount, we

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.860
will calculate the intrinsic

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.420
value of our company.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.520
Remember, for example, when we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
evaluated by multiple that what

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.260
we did was to analyze how much

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.640
companies are worth in our

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040
market, in our sector, etc.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.820
We took conclusions and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.780
applied them to ours.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.840
In this case the discount

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.700
of cash flow is, I like to call

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.080
it a custom costume.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.700
We will create a method in which

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.320
we will incorporate absolutely

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.400
all the factors that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.940
we consider related to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.500
our company.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.360
We will only measure ourselves

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.880
and we will project, estimate

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.180
what cash flows we will

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.300
generate.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.760
So we will calculate the intrinsic

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.800
value of our company and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.720
another benefit is that it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.600
is a more flexible method and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.920
I will give you an example

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.100
so that you understand what

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.840
I mean.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.900
For example, we can project

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.420
different scenarios.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.440
Imagine that we have projected

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.640
a 5% sales growth for the next

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.080
five years because you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.060
consider that prudent,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.980
reasonable, but it may be

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.100
that a 10% or 10 and a

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.440
half sales growth will occur.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.100
We can see different scenarios.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.700
The base scenario, a more flat conservative

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.500
scenario and an optimistic

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.420
scenario.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.740
And what we can do is incorporate

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.320
it into the method and do a sensitivity

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.040
analysis, for example, in which

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.580
we estimate what the impact

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.720
each of the scenarios has

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.380
on the value of the company.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.040
Well, as we've seen, it's a more

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.420
tailor-made method, it's more

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.240
complete, but it also has a number

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.480
of peres, a number of disadvantages

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.640
that you should simply

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.460
know.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.780
The first is that it is a more complicated

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.580
method for many reasons, because it

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.680
is more laborious to do so, it is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.520
more difficult to project the cash

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.940
flows of the self-enterprise than

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.180
to analyze the multiple in your sector.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.160
In addition, it requires you to have

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.540
a business plan, because it

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.740
is to project what will happen in the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.200
coming years, because it requires you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.180
to have analyzed and planned well, that

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.900
you know you have estimated how much

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.720
you will grow, how much you will sell,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240
what developments you will make,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.320
what investments you will

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.080
make, etc.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.580
Very detailed, if you don't

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.040
have this done well, the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.940
discount of cash flows won't be

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.320
able to do well, you won't be

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.500
able to project those flows.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.880
So it's more laborious, it requires

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.960
more financial knowledge,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.620
it requires a greater knowledge

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.080
of it's more complicated, it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.740
something you have to keep in mind.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.920
And, in addition, another circumstance

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.400
I want to highlight is that

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.060
the discount of cash flows is a

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.500
valuation method that is supported

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.880
in numerous hypotheses.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.620
We can call it hypotheses, we

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.140
can call it assumptions, we

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.420
can call it variables as you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.460
want to call it, but in the end you

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.420
have in mind that this is

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.460
doing very complex calculations

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.920
using a method, projecting

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.580
the flows, discounting

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.160
them, etc.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.440
A mathematical method, but in which

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.380
you have incorporated many

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.100
variables or many hypotheses.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.040
For example, as I said before,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.960
how much you'll grow in sales.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.620
Of course, if all these hypotheses

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.640
are not supported in reality,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.140
the valuation you receive

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.860
will not really represent

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.100
the value of your company.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.200
To understand this, I'll tell

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.000
you a personal anecdote.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.940
I, the first thing I did when I

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.080
joined the professional world,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.660
before I ended the career,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.080
is to do the valuation of an

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.940
immovable promoter, who I evaluated

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.660
using the discount of cash

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.480
flows.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.040
A promoter who had or has real

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.460
estate assets that are soil

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.180
in different stages of Well,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.180
I used the method and did

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.880
it ultra-orthodox.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.260
The method was well applied.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.020
The financial modeling was perfect.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.840
What happens is that the hypotheses

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.300
on which it was based,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.300
basically that I estimated,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.780
lacked all common sense.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.200
It was absolute stupidity.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.060
I will give you an example

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.960
so you can get an idea.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.700
It was 2006 or so, I think,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.680
we were in full real estate boom.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.900
The price of housing seemed

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.000
to be going up to infinity.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.560
Well, because I projected

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.780
a growth in the price of housing

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.380
from, I think, 7 and a half percent

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.140
annually to a sustainable,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.780
indefinite future.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.200
What is stupid.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.280
But of course, by incorporating that

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.880
hypothesis within the model, it gave

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.000
a valuation of the company.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.500
The total value of the company

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.720
was 300 million.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.660
We were in a buying-selling process.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.260
We were selling that company

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.060
to our client.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.360
Another hypothesis is that

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.420
from the soils that the promoter

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.820
had, we consider that in

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.160
a period of five years,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.700
all those soils would

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.320
become finalist soils.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.920
In other words, they would become

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.760
urban soils.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.420
There are two possibilities.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.980
That they were stupid, that they

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.500
did not, obviously, and that they

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.040
made the value we reached, that

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.800
they were 300 million, really

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.220
lacking all common sense.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.240
The method was well applied.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.820
This is what we always say that Excel

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.180
supports everything.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.640
You can know the method, but if the

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.980
hypotheses you are building on

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.100
are not good, there is no common

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.600
sense in them, you do not have

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.580
good knowledge of the market,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.460
you do not have good

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.340
knowledge of your business,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.580
etc., the value you reach will

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.640
have no meaning.
