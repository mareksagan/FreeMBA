00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.760
Silvia, I would like to

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.500
analyze the segmentation strategy

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.180
in your sector, in the luxury

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.280
sector and in particular in

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.060
the perfume sector.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580
If you tell us what have been the variables

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.940
with which they have always

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.120
been segmented, the traditional variables.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.160
For now or until very recently we

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.120
have always been talking about,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.380
especially when we were developing

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.340
a product, when we were developing

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.580
a advertising campaign, you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.260
were always looking for a type

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.200
of consumer that was classified

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.000
according to whether it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.220
was a man, woman, age, young,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.060
35, 45, 55, 60.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.680
It was a demographic issue.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.480
Also if they were cosmopolitan people,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.540
if they were based on their lifestyle

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.060
habits, if they traveled a lot, etc.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.180
Well, there you were, in addition

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.500
to the demographic variables,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.400
you were including some vitudinar

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.860
variable.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.760
But that has been like a lot in

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.280
the last few years, but it has

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820
always been what it was, what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.540
age it is, where you live, if it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.520
is a big city, if it is a small

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.100
city, etc.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.780
I think you are also going to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.660
be on the socio-economic profile.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.600
Evidently, the upper class, which is the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.060
upper middle class and the low middle

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.500
class, or the middle class, that is, that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080
really also the social issue was obviously

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.260
super important in our sector.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340
And I think the trend, in addition

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.840
to...

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260
It was pure demographic, as you said, age,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.640
gender and geography, where they live

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.260
and so on.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.680
Then it was a little sophisticated

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.140
and included topics such

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.500
as attitude and cosmopolitan,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.560
as you said, which are

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.620
more related to profiles.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.980
But I think the trend now is to

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.540
go beyond and analyze and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.300
determine profiles or people who

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.800
call you to some sites based

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.780
on how they use your product

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.560
or why they buy you.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320
We were segmenting a little,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.460
as I said, at the demographic,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.340
social, etc. level.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.760
What happens is that we have realized

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.180
that that in the end does not serve

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.660
you for anything, because it is really

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.580
so extremely generalist that you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.080
do not clearly identify who your

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.700
consumer is.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.540
And that doesn't allow you to do good,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.820
neither product development, nor

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.020
communication development, nor anything.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.320
A woman 40 years old is not the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.760
same woman 40 years old 20 years

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.840
ago and also does not behave best

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.580
as a woman 40 years old, at best

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.580
behaves at the level of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.780
attitude, at the level of perfumes

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.920
to use or at the level of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.060
style of truth, etc., as

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.220
a girl 20.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.640
And, on the contrary, a girl of 20 can

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.740
be much more classic.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.120
In the end, that was not

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.780
useful to you.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.960
And then, on the other hand, as

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.580
I told you before, it is true

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.980
that the digital world and especially

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.000
the topic of social media,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.100
development allows you to get to an

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.660
extreme personalization, that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.620
is, really identify who your consumer is.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.420
So, if you know exactly what your

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.200
consumer, Pepito Pérez, likes to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.140
go to the mountain, likes to travel

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.420
every day of the week, likes

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.980
to buy gifts for his friends, loves

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.120
the whole world of games, etc.,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.960
because obviously you will be able

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.680
to identify, taking into account

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.900
those tastes of him, you will

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.060
be able to develop products

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.360
and communication campaigns

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.840
and rework the whole topic of

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080
the approach at the point of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.120
sale in a way to, somehow,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.060
touch him and really get to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.500
what he is interested in.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.520
And that segmentation you say, that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.660
micro-segmentation, I, for

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.840
example, in sectors or in companies

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.140
that I see it, which is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.800
absolutely taken to the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.440
person, because Amazon, when I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.460
enter Amazon, what is recommending

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.380
me is based on what I have

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.340
bought before.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.940
In your case, I don't think it is,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.540
that is, it seems to me more complicated

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.480
to be taken to the person.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.620
You will have to identify a number

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.120
of people or a number of profiles,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.800
because you can't adapt as

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.880
much as Amazon.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.220
I will not be able to do this if I am

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.720
already in the digital world.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.420
Man, because you, but the number

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.300
of products you have, for example,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.160
are X, because you have a portfolio

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.560
of perfumes and how to get to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.360
them, you can actually have

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.560
very personalized impacts

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.540
depending on when it is

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.300
the last time you bought,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.660
if you know you have to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.700
make a gift, etc.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.580
You, through your point of sale

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.980
and through digital, can

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.120
know if that person, first when

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.080
is his birthday, if he is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.500
a consumer of essence or is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.100
a consumer alone, that is, you

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.140
really have very identified

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.180
that profile.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.460
But we are already even

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.200
asking why we will not be able

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.940
to make specifically

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.600
customized perfumes, specific

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.020
to you, even based,, not only

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.660
on your tastes, if you like more

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.840
fresh or like more intense,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.060
but also according to your pH,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.020
depending on you what you eat,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.500
because maybe a type of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.800
perfume reacts better with

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.720
your skin type, depending

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.540
on your nutrition,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.200
and can be ad hoc for

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.580
you.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.700
Why can't we do that if it'

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.680
s already done?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.640
If even the other day the law came

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.180
out, it seems to me it was

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.180
an article, it seems to me

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.100
it was Nestlé, which is working

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.760
on food based on the DNA of

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.600
each of the people.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.840
Why not the perfume?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.200
Exactly the same.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.320
You can do this personal

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.740
adaptation.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.600
We are in a world so brutal at the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.860
level of specialization that why

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.220
will we not be able to get, what

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.200
I told you before, to know you what

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.420
is what you like, what your life

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.580
habits, what is what you eat,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.460
what is what absolutely everything,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.460
why will I not be able to

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.940
make a perfume that is only

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.820
specifically for you, why

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.040
not?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.180
With which we face the sticks, what

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.120
we are the brands, we are giving

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.540
the turn absolutely everything

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.500
that is our strategy, forgetting

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.240
ourselves, not so much of the product

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.260
I am the brand, this is my communication

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.980
campaign, this is my product that

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.060
I offer you, this is my visual

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.260
message advertising, but in reverse,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.300
your consumer, what is what

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.640
you want me to give you, and you

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.060
what is what you want, with which

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.720
we will have to work differently

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.380
and in a super personalized and

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.860
specialized way depending on

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.220
the different types

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.960
of consumers, with which we

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.180
are really working on identifying

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.400
different profiles and knowing

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.300
why you are buying me,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.360
what you are buying me, what

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800
you are expecting from me,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.720
because in the end that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.340
is also what will make

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.520
me the difference with

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.680
regard to the rest of

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.960
the competition.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.800
So, of course, we need anyway

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.080
because you are a person on Mondays,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.680
you are a person on Tuesdays,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.780
you are a person on Wednesday,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.080
and maybe depending on how you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.480
are on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesday

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.680
or Weekends I can work on you,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.580
I can identify what is what you

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.760
are looking for, what you are buying

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.840
my brand, which is not only

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.380
for your use, but also what

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.200
is what you are looking for

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.460
in the face of others, because

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.360
at the end in the world of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.460
perfume there is a very important

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.060
part of gift, but depending

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.760
on who you want to give, how much

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.020
you want to spend, where you

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.140
want to buy it, what format

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.280
you want to buy, because

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.040
the person you are selling

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.280
it is a person who is a traveler,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.760
who is a sportsman, etc.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.900
That is why I tell you that it is

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.200
a micro segmentation, it is

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.840
a micro personalization, that obviously

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.360
we have to work from the point

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.320
of view of brands and as I told

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.380
you, it is no longer coffee for everyone,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.520
it is no longer the same product for

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.220
everyone, neither the same advertising

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.840
campaigns, neither the same visual

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.860
merchandising, nor the same

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.380
training, I have to work specifically

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.000
for you, for you, and that requires

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.260
not only at the level of product

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.020
or brand strategy, but even

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.660
at the level of the company's

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.000
own organization, it obliges you

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.420
to reorganize and rethink

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.640
and develop in another different

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.360
way.
