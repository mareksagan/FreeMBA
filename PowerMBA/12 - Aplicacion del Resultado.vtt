00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.160
You should already know how

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.720
the results are created and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.740
also be familiar with the

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.700
main sizes that you inform us

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.180
about such as gross margin,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.140
EBITDA, EBIT or net profit

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.660
or performance result.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
In this class, what we will see briefly

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.220
is, once we have already calculated

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.800
the result of the exercise, we will

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.740
see how we transfer it to the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.960
situation balance sheet

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.520
and how the status of results and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.820
the situation balance sheet are

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.340
related.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.370
Let us take a brief look at

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.850
the accounting process we have seen earlier.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.310
The first site where the movements

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.970
are recorded is in the daily book,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.730
which chronologically and every

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.050
day the accountants are going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.010
to record each of the movements.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.330
From there, they are transferred

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.510
to each of the accounts, to individual

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.430
accounts, they are transferred to those

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.930
movements and in the accounts

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.250
what we do is calculate the balance

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590
of each account, of banks,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.410
social capital, etc.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.150
At the end of the period, we transfer

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.350
this balance to the financial

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.330
statements, which, as we saw, are

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.530
a summary of all transactions

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.610
and all the movements

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.850
that have been generated.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.090
As I said, financial statements

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.330
are related to each other.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.050


00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.470
In this case, in this class what we

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.830
will see is how the state of results,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.030
in particular the magnitude,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.570
the net profit, is related, as we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.230
transfer it to the situation

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.150
balance sheet.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.840
We have the results state where

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.820
we calculate the outcome of the exercise.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.980
Well, now we have to see what

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.120
a company does with the result

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.320
of the exercise.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.440
Companies have two options: they

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.720
can distribute net profits in

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.320
the form of dividends among their

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.640
partners or leave them in the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.980
company, that is, they can reinvest them.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.340
The dividend policy must respond

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.360
to strategic decisions.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.200
For example, if you want to grow,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840
if you are in a growing market or

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.880
have the opportunity to grow within

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.800
your market or through international

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.100
expansion or product

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.260
development, etc.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.240
The normal thing is that you reinvest

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.360
a lot of the profits because

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.300
you have to finance that growth.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.130
Or if you're going to have to make

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.770
investments in fixed assets in the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.270
short term.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.770
In this case, it will need to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.750
be considered and re-invested.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.870
This policy is known as payout

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.170
and the formula is basically the percentage

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890
of dividends that are distributed

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.970
over profits, the percentage of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.290
profits that are distributed

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.350
to the partners.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.390
Well, since once we already

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.250
know what the amount of profits

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.930
that have not been distributed,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.450
that part increases the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.310
net profit of the company,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.530
obviously.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.950
And it must be considered within

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.270
the balance sheet in this account,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.930
in the account of undistributed

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.770
profits.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.860
Net assets are equal to the initial

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.140
contributions of the partners

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.300
in the form of social capital

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.220
or subsequent if a capital increase

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.000
has been made plus all the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.040
benefits that are generated

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.820
and are not distributed

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.840
between the partners.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.220
This increases the net

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.940
worth of the company over

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.760
the years.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.680
Let us see it from another perspective.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.780
Net assets are equal to the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.580
total assets less debt,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.560
less liabilities.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.640
If a net asset increase has

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.620
occurred in a period,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.980
it must be due to a movement,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.580
a variation in some of

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.700
the other blocs.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.580
Take this case for example.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.860
Here's the evolution from year

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.500
1 to year 2 of a company that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.820
has earned a net profit

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.020
of $100,000.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.060
Well, in the balance we can see

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.980
what has been the evolution, that

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.900
is, where the variation has occurred.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.200
In this case, as we see, the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900
liability is the same in year 1 and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.360
year 2 and what has increased has

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.760
been the asset.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.940
The asset has increased during

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.920
that period by $100,000 which

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.540
is equal to net profit.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.160
And this same company, if we go

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.120
to the year 3, gets a net

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.660
profit of $200,000.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.300
But in this case what we see is that

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.840
the asset has remained the same between

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.280
year 2 and year 3.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.620
What is what happened?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.620
Well, it has decreased the liability

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320
by $200,000 which is equal to the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.240
net profit.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.140
This, if we return to the equation

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.460
we have said that we have just commented

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.260
on that the net asset is equal to the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.580
assets, to the investments that

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.860
have made less to the liabilities,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.780
because it is well understood.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.380
So, let's make a final

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.980
summary.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.760
In the state of results that

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.200
we have on screen we get the

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.620
magnitude of the exercise

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.600
result to net profit.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.790
The company decides what to do with

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.830
that net profit and defines its payout.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.310
You can either divide it

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.930
or reinvest it within the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.490
company.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.550
And the amount we decide

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.170
to reinvest within the company

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.450
is incorporated into the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.390
balance sheet by increasing

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.410
the net asset in a account

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.350
called undistributed profits.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.570
The balance sheet is squared

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.810
so that in the next period

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.830
the assets minus liabilities

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.590
are equal to net assets or

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.330
the assets are equal to net

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.890
assets plus liabilities.
