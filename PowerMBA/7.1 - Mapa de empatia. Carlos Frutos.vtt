WEBVTT

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.230
Well, I think we have clear what

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.350
it is, how it is structured, what

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.490
it serves for, etc.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.430
But what I think we are all

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.490
thinking, all the students

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.590
are thinking, is that it sounds

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.670
very good, but I think it would

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.530
be hard for us to do one right

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.130
now.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.250
I’ll ask you to think about an

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.090
example of a customer person or

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.690
a target and to do the exercise

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.590
of doing so.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.090
Yes, that kind of tools or you put

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.910
them into practice or someone gives

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.670
you a clear example or hardly

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.630
then are applicable.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.610
Therefore, I have prepared an example

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.750
based on something that I think

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.470
is very current and is the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.910
concern that we have in general

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.630
all citizens about the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.250
future of our pensions.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.190
If we put ourselves in the place

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.750
of a life insurance company that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.810
has to build a value proposal

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.650
and a marketing mix for a market

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.250
segment, like it can be that of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.730
workers between 30 and 60 years

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.990
old, they are in a time

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.830
of huge unrest, as we will

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.370
now see by all that is being

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.770
seen.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.030
Yes, because of the noise we hear that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.450
you save, because pensions,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.890
etc., those things, right?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.650
And that it’s still time to change

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.790
what it does and how it does.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.350
I am talking about 30, 60 years.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.890
That’s why you have less time,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.350
right?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.270
Well, but it still remains.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.130
That is why I am not talking about a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.530
65-year-old worker who is about to retire

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.150
or a newly incorporated into the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.590
workplace with 25, who still

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.310
sees it a little far away.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.850
I have therefore chosen, after a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.970
selection process, in this process

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.530
you commented on, a potentially

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.090
viable segment for this

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.290
hypothetical life insurance

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.990
company.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.010
Workers 30, 60, generally married,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.170
with family, in many cases

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.530
with children, right?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.690
Where I think there is a huge opportunity.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.830
Now we will apply the empathy

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.150
map to this segment.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.270
I will make a small summary of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.670
each of the areas to then go

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.010
to see how this map of empathy

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.630
inspires us to build the value

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.230
proposal, our positioning,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.390
our selling argumentary

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.870
and our marketing

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.510
mix.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.570
Yes, because effectively if

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.970
we make the map of empathy and put

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.330
it in the cage, right?

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.390
In the end, it has no significance.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.930
As we said at the beginning, it is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.530
one of the tools, along with the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.970
castover person, that helps us understand

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.290
the client very well, but

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.870
for what?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.290
So to adapt everything that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.310
comes after, the value proposal,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.450
the positioning, the marketing

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.670
mix, etc., to the conclusions

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.810
we’re going to draw now,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.390
right?

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.530
The Map of Empathy.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.570
That is.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.170
Effectively, these tools do not

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.310
only have to be easy and not

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.690
complicate our life, but also

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.910
have to be practical, because

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.050
if not, really, and often I know

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.070
that we do them, but then

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.650
they do not get all the game

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.270
possible.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.890
I have tried in this example

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.610
that I am going to share with

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.310
you, to really show how, through

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.150
the realization of an empathy

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.210
map, we can come to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.490
conclusions that might otherwise

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.790
have cost us more.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.650
General is okay?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.710
Well, if we see in the picture what

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.490
he thinks and feels, in general,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.670
if we analyze that segment of 30

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.370
to 60 years, he has a huge

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.010
concern, but he is very aware

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.010
that he does not have enough

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
knowledge about personal finances

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.530
and that he longs, therefore,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.750
for someone to advise him.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.650
There is a lot of concern

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.550
in the segment.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.650
We have not yet gone to the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.350
action of, please inform me, but

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.450
there is a huge concern about

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.970
I would like to be informed.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.370
Well, and then there are other aspects,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.190
such as ensuring the future of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.110
your family, the short-term, because

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.910
when we talk about pensions we are

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.890
talking about the medium to long-term,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.290
but then there is another problem.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.350
What if something happens to me in the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.830
short term?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.590
I am the generator of income

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.350
from my family.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.670
This block above may have something

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.870
to do with when we talk about what

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.550
has validated the problem, that

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.790
I feel a need, because what you are

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.650
counting is that, it feels you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.850
have that problem you don’t know

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.910
about finance.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.150
That is the subjective part and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.870
also the desire.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.510
I wish I would like to know more about

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.830
finance in an environment where

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.670
I think it’s complicated.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.770
If you look at the quadrante of what

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.690
you see, you generally see

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.690
that savings products are complex,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.410
that there is a huge variety, that

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.150
they have a component

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.430
of tax knowledge that depends

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.510
a lot on people.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.870
This makes you start to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.370
worry too, once you decide to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.490
commit a solution, this becomes

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.570
complicated.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.570
A wide and complex offer.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.190
As for what he says and does, generally

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.250
what he says is that his future

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.650
depends a lot on his savings

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.570
ability, for all he’s seeing,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.490
things like that my company

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:45.590
should help me, complaints.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.290
If we see what you hear, because

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.870
you hear permanently, in the media,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.890
in social media, in the bar

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.070
conversations, even the rum

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.390
rum of the pension shell ends,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.290
in the future people 30

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.530
or 40 years old will have

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.630
very difficult to have retirement

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.170
or will have less.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.810
I’m not saying that it’s so or not,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.270
I’m saying that’s what you hear.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.370
That rum rum, as you say, clearly

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.350
influences the perception

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.050
of this person, a representative

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.670
of the 30- or 60-year-

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.950
old working class.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.010
If we see your worries, loss

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.690
of employment, having an accident,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.310
not getting your pension in

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.950
the future, those are

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.150
your main concerns.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.770
Sometimes in the conscious and sometimes

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.750
in the subconscious.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.430
What needs does he have?

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.470
Because it has a need to

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.270
protect the family, its family

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.870
unity from an economic point of view.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.430
What happens in case of an accident?

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.350
For example, because I can

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.710
save for the future of my

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.030
pension, but if within a month

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.950
I have an accident, I not only

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.750
have a financial problem,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.250
but could even increase it because

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.190
I would need a series of

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.270
extraordinary income to

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.250
treat the accident I had had.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.370
It will also be a complement

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.810
to the pension in the

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.510
future.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.570
I don’t know how the public

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.030
pension system will work, but

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.930
I will have to complement

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.990
it as I am supplementing

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.690
today through copag other

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.990
systems such as the health system.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.270
That is.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.270
Well, this has been in a very

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.370
brief way our map of empathy of

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.150
a type representative of this

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.850
segment of workers 30 to 60

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.890
years old.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.370
Of course, what matters is again

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.810
with the hat of this insurance company

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.030
that has to modify, create or evolve

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.930
its value proposal for this segment

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.530
is how it acts accordingly, how

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.610
this map of empathy, this analysis

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.030
I have done with the representative

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.230
of the segment or imagining

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.610
in the head of the representative

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.770
of the segment how

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.190
it will help me to continue

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.310
taking steps.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.610
Well, then if we see some examples

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.930
like we have in the picture on what

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.550
you think and feel we say I don’t know

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.890
enough of personal finance

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.550
and I would like to have a counselor.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.910
I think that’s what we all

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.390
think we’ve ever started thinking

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.210
we should do something.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.650
Well, this should lead us

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.850
to the conclusion that we

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.050
have to incorporate within

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.890
our portfolio, our value

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.570
proposal, the ability to

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.370
advise our customer in this

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.370
complex product series.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.310
This is very different from when

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.430
you sell a home insurance or

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.610
a car insurance that you sell by features.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.050
Here it is sold adapting our portfolio

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.530
to a specific need and a specific

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.830
situation of the customer.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.410
Basically that I totally

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.650
agree on what you think people

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.550
generally feel when facing decisions

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.410
and I also know that if I

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.770
knew I would get more yield

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.790
to my money, but I

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.670
don’t know.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.210
This can block decision

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.030
making.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.310
But instead, if, as you say, we

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.650
incorporate a certain service of

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.390
advice that in home and car insurance

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.650
does not make any need, because

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.910
probably as we are adapting

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.990
our value proposal

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.410
from that concern that it

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.970
has, we will have a competitive

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.030
advantage.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.650
Of course, it’s a lot more for a second

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.750
in the client’s place and I understand

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.090
perfectly that it’s a lot more powerful.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.210
There are several aspects that lead

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.770
us to the conclusion that we should

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.630
include and promote and sell in

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.230
a inseparable binom along with

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.830
life insurance savings, a risk

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.190
life insurance, a life insurance

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.930
the most traditional of all.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.550
When he says, when our client type

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.690
says I need to secure my future

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.110
and that of my family and if something

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.430
happens to us in the short term

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.210
or what happens if I have an accident

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.270
or how I protected my family.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.510
When I’m saving through any savings

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.170
product, forecast, I’m accumulating

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.190
wealth, but if something

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.610
happens to me in the short term,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.890
I’ve not accumulated

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.970
enough wealth.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.490
That to greatly alleviate that

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.970
concern of our client type,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.150
we must incorporate life

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.950
at risk and argue it that way.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.070
Another example would be when we

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.330
know that our potential

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.510
customer is, our type customer

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.970
is constantly hearing that rum

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.810
rum you commented on.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.530
I think that should be part

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.010
of our business argumentary

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.810
of our savings portfolio.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.410
You have to do this because there

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.270
is actually a risk that in the future

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.750
pensions will not maintain

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.010
at least the current level.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.430
This adaptation, for example, this example

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.010
you put is not a topic of the proposal

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.090
of values, yes, it is a more tactical

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.910
topic of the commercial argumentary,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.010
of the messages, of the commercial

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.110
argumentary with which we will

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.810
impact you.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.570
Because if you use this, you

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.870
enter like a knife, because you

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.250
know that the customer is actually

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.190
hearing this, then you empathize

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.510
very quickly with him.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.630
Since I know you are concerned about

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.330
this issue, I go to the solution.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.910
Exactly, as we see the empathy

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.130
map, it not only serves us to

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.250
see realities that influence

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.590
our portfolio, our marketing

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.050
mix, but even our commercial

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.590
approach too.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.590
And finally, an important

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.930
example is that as we see also

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.430
in what our customer sees

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.770
is that the taxation of savings

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.350
is favorable, but it is complex,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.410
depends much on the limits

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.210
of reduction and tax deduction

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.210
of our client.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.970
Finally, it is a complex issue that

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.590
is not for everyone the same and

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.730
therefore this forces us to have within

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.710
our commercial approach, unlike other

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.030
branches of insurance, a process

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.390
of 360-degree analysis, global

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.330
analysis of our client, because

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.950
our final proposal will depend

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.490
much on the concrete situation

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.150
of each individual, no longer

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.030
of each segment, but even

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.090
of each individual.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.450
Well, because this has been four

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.310
examples of acting accordingly

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.850
following this empathy map analysis

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.510
we have done.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.470
I have to tell you that this is the

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.310
first time in my life that I

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.390
understand the map of empathy,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.510
because until now I had not understood it.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.650
I had studied the subject, but

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.050
had never seen a clear example

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.070
of how it was used.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.070
I think that has happened to a

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.230
lot of people and I think it

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.270
is to be grateful because seeing

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.870
the examples and seeing how it is

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.990
used we understand how practical

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.090
it is and how we can use the

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.750
information we obtain through this

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.110
so orderly analysis to then

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.150
adapt the value proposal, the

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.530
marketing mix and others.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.290
That is what I want.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.030
Many thanks.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.110
Thanks to you.
