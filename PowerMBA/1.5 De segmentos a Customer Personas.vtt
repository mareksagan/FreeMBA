WEBVTT

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.880
So far what have we done?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.960
Well, what you have done is to

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.080
learn to segment, incorporating variables

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.120
that provide you with a lot of information

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.760
and that people do not usually incorporate,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.700
because why they buy us, the benefit,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.020
I don't know how they use us,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.780
things like that.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.680
So what you did is apply those

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.520
variables to your target market

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.360
or current customers and for each

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.800
of those variables you have

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.340
segments, for each you have

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.020
segments.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.400
We talked about geography, because

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.720
if you introduce the geographic variable,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.800
you will have a geographical

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.960
segmentation.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.280
If you enter the profit segment,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.640
you will have a profit segmentation.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.260
But what do we have?

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.280
We have segments.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.100
What are the segments?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.180
Well, because segments are like masses of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.400
people, aren't they?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.060
You can measure a segment, you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.880
can quantify it, but you

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.140
can't describe a segment, you

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.020
can't analyze it.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.960
So what we're going to do is move

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
from segments to people.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.580
That is, we will turn those

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.660
masses into people and for

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.040
that we will use a tool that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.560
is the customer person, which

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.140
is a tool or a very powerful

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.700
concept, which we recommend

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.240
and always use.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.140
What is the Customer Person?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.780
The customer person is a fictional

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480
person, usually fictional, that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.760
you have created and that is representative

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.880
of your customers.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.200
That is, you have several customer

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.720
people who are representative

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.120
of your customers, your most important

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.860
segments, etc.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.260
And what we do is describe

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.540
each of those people,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.680
we will turn them into

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.020
real people.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.520
We will understand them very well.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.860
We will provide a lot of information

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.800
about each of them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.080
And why do this?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.360
Why go from segmentation

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.660
to a number of customer

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.880
people?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.920
One, but usually you have more,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
three, five, depends on each situation,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.640
but not a thousand, right?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.020
Why is it?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.020
For many reasons.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.220
The first, because behind

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.720
your results, your sales,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.480
behind marketing, what's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.920
there?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.280
There are customers and customers who

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.120
are, are people.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.580
So it's much better to think

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.940
of people, not masses.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.280
We are very aware of our

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.820
customers, that we become

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.060
a customer-centric company.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.700
This word that came out of fashion

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.040
a few years ago and with which consultants

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.080
have earned so much money

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.900
and so, right?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.800
Selling projects of this,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.220
that I did.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.660
A customer-centered company, a company

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.320
that is close to its customers,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.480
who thinks about its customers,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.840
who has them present, who understands

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.040
them, well, because it helps,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.620
right?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.260
Instead of thinking about segments, who

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.940
are we addressing?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920
Think of children, think of people.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.820
And we can even, this is a recommendation,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.100
it is to share it with the entire

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.380
organization, that everyone

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.640
has a mindset on who are our

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.220
customers.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960
Know them well and understand them well.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.320
The customer person helps us in this

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.080
process of investigating your client,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.020
of consulting things, of understanding

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.840
him every day better, helps

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.700
us a lot.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.320
If you have segments, you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.140
don't know, right?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.800
That is, it is very difficult to understand or

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.840
investigate them and to know them more and more

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.280
every day.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.220
But when you have a reference, when you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.300
have turned it into a person, even if

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.560
it is fictional, because it is as easy

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.340
as going to him and trying to understand

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.240
him better.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.560
Here I'm putting an example that, well,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.280
can be a bit stupid, but in the shipwreck

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.420
movie, Wilson is like the character

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.520
that creates, isn't it?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.560
Tom Hanks, so that he can accompany her

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.200
and others and talk to him, well, because

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.460
we can't illustrate a little.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.600
We are not creating people we have

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360
to understand and we almost have

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.420
to give them life.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.180
Another benefit that is the result of the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.880
above is that, of course, when you know

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.620
your customers very well, we have said

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.140
it a thousand times, but it is that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.560
I think it is important to emphasize it.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.640
When you know your customers very well,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.020
when you know what goes through their

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.060
head, when you know what they do,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.140
what they like, what they don't

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.200
like, what they think of you, why

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.660
they buy you, etc., a thousand things,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.960
imagine everything you can improve.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.980
I don't know, then your ads, your website,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.080
all the sales discourses you make,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.440
etc., everything you do,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.760
right?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.040
The products also, because it is that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.500
you can improve a lot and, therefore,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.480
you will sell a lot more.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.580
Let's see how it is done.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.800
Let us summarize it in two steps.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.800
The first thing you need to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.020
do is identify them.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.840
Who are my customer people?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.640
And that's where people do it badly.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.340
It does hurt.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.000
That is, you have to go from having,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400
then, some knowledge of your customers,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.860
your market, segmentation

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.160
and so on, to say, but how do

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.780
I identify now, I don't know,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.800
four customer concrete people?

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.900
How do I do it?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.360
Well, that is the first step.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.240
And the next step is, when you have

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.320
identified them, you have to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.280
describe them, you have

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.940
to analyze them, that we will see

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.740
in a later class.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.160
All the information we should know

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.460
about our customers and that almost

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.980
no one knows to understand them well.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.620
Let's look at how to identify them.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.920
First, I want you to be clear one

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.540
thing and it is that I assure

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.960
you, although when you put it you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.260
find it difficult, that you can

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.800
create or identify a series of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.100
customer people X, we will put

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.600
you that five, every time I say

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.700
a different number, but good, that

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.540
is, they are not very many,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.700
that with five customer people or

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.960
sometimes with much less, understanding

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.360
them, looking at them, deepening

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.340
in them and selling them to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.900
them, you will be able to sell

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.540
much more to all your customers

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.060
and you will be able to

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.640
extrapolate these conclusions

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
to all customers.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.600
That's what, that's the first thing

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.660
I want you to have in mind, because

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.940
a lot of people are stuck.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.880
Then we will see why.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.840
But I assure you, I assure you

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.200
that they are really representative

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.980
of what is important.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.080
This guy, this customer person can

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.660
be 21 years old, but the same, it

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.720
is representative of people who instead

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.040
of 21 years old has 48, but in the

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.480
important in relation to you is representative

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.320
and understanding him well,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.380
you can sell much more to the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.280
48, because in this case the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.300
important variable segmentation

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.880
will not be the age.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.800
I am advancing.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.360
Well, well, how do you identify

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.180
customer people?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.800
The only thing you have to do is to

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.260
have the variables segmented.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600
What you usually do is cross

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.220
those variables or have them

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.220
all together.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.200
We cross the age, the profile,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.100
the benefit, how it uses us, for

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.120
what, etc.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.440
We cross them, that can be, there

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.760
are people who do it with a matrix,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.960
there are people who do it in a

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.800
more, good, more intuitive

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.640
way, pointing them all together and

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.980
that should give us, if we did

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.360
well, we should be able to identify

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.500
a series of customer people, crossing

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.360
them, crossing them the important

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.060
variables, because of course,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.600
if you cross all the variables,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.660
then imagine, imagine

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.180
that age is not important.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.220
You cross the age with the

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.800
profession, with the civil state,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.320
with that you get a million customer

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.620
person, but as I said, you can,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.300
you can always, if you cross the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.560
important variables, you will

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.300
be able to identify a series,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.740
no, that is, a series, I say,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.940
a few customer people.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.140
The second way to do this is that sometimes

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.680
even, even if it is, it seems less methodological

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.480
and so, we do it and almost it is that

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.580
we are better or maybe we should

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.260
put together the two, it is to think

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.640
about your current customers and

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960
think about current customers

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.180
that are representative in general

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.540
of the rest.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.560
I don't know, think of five customers

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.340
that are representative of what

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.300
is important, those who adore you, who

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.280
are the heliodopts, well, I don't know,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.940
they're sure you think of them,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.760
think of them and then already parts

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.180
of a real person or a real company,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.820
if you sell to the B2B

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.620
and analyze them, analyze them,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.700
look at them, it's less abstract,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.400
feel tened and analyze them and

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.280
the starting point that is.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.680
And now I will end up explaining

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.580
that this always costs me, it costs

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.080
me to understand, but then with

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.120
the next class in which we will

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.740
talk about the custom, some

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.020
customer people in the Power MBA,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.560
I think it will understand

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.580
better, I will explain why people

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.940
do not do well the customer person,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.200
why everyone knows this, the

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.300
customer person and sell projects

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.480
of this and that, there are

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.660
agencies that do, these dynamics,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.620
but then almost everyone,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.360
yes, very chulo and that,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.240
but then they do

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.120
not use it.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.680
Why is it?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.080
I'll tell you that I'll tell you that

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.000
two reasons, the first is that they

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.180
pick up templates of these that are

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.960
closed, that there are thousands around,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.240
then they describe the customer person

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.100
and what they do is are detailing

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.400
information that is not really important,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.080
because they put this guy on the

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.280
screen or whoever, it doesn't matter,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.320
I invent it and then they describe,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.420
because well, he has 37 years, he

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.040
has wife and children, he works in

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.540
an insurance company, he

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.060
has an income of not know how much,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.580
he likes the sport, daddy,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.980
I know, I don't know, I'm inventing

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.780
everything.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.240
Well, then they have described a person

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.840
and this results that they can not then,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.360
when they do the process of extrapolating

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.100
it to other clients, to the rest

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.460
of customers, because they can

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.580
not extrapolate it because they

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.880
say, because it is my other

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.140
clients, what do I do?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.040
What do I do?

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.580
A customer person for each of them,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.680
who do not have 37 years, do not

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.320
work in an insurance company,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.480
etc., then there is already complicating,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.420
they are already blocked, which is

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.600
also the result of the next cause,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.640
that people do not do it well, is

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.020
that they are not really considering

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.880
the important variables

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.040
of segmentation, they are not focusing

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.920
on the important things, eye,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.560
the important things depend

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.760
on what you sell, sometimes it can

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.540
be the variable, the ADAS and

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.020
the profession, but sometimes not,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.620
but that not in all cases you

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.680
have to describe everything,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.340
right?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.260
What you have to keep in mind is

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.360
what are the important variables,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.920
truly important and focus,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.600
and from those variables, focus

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.360
on them and you will be

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.780
noticed the customer person

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.920
and you have to describe them

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.620
in that and then if you are 37

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.480
years old and work in insurance

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.040
or not, if it is not important

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.620
because you do not wear on that,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.420
because the same for the important

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.600
variable, I know, that buys

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.020
you because it has a problem of

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.640
not know what, health, imagine,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.600
and that is the important thing,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.520
because then you have 21 or 38

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.880
years of age doesn't matter,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.820
but you have to identify all

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.520
who buy you because they have

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.040
a health problem, create a

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.260
customer and understand it well

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.180
why you buy, why you don't

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.300
buy, how you compare with the

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.040
competition, etc, etc,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.580
etc, etc, and there will be

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.200
many of your customers who

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.680
have that same, that they

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.380
buy you for

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.020
But if what you do is the typical

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.860
template and you wear it off,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.720
then it's like it's squaring you

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.080
off because you can't extrapolate

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.800
it to the rest of the customers.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.760
It may not have been understood

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.180
much of this, so what I am going

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.580
to do is, I will tell you an

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.800
example now below of how

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.600
we have, from some of the customer

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.860
person of Power Envie and how

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.260
we have moved from segments

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.960
to customer person.
