00:00.000 --> 00:28.320
The business model of the Red Nebula was relatively simple, it is the typical marketplace model

00:28.320 --> 00:30.320
where you are crossing between offer and demand.

00:30.320 --> 00:36.320
In the offer we had restaurants, restaurants of home food, in general they were very fragmented,

00:36.320 --> 00:42.320
there were no big brands that had many restaurants, they were individual restaurants throughout Spain, in our case.

00:42.320 --> 00:50.320
And on the side of the user, you would have individual users who were looking for,

00:50.320 --> 00:56.320
that still in their decision process of what they were going to eat that day or what they were going to have for dinner that day,

00:56.320 --> 00:58.320
they were not yet clear what they were going to have.

00:58.320 --> 01:06.320
With this I mean that the aggregator fulfills the function of helping in that decision process,

01:06.320 --> 01:11.320
of hey, I eat pizza, I eat Chinese, and within Chinese, this restaurant, this other, depending on different characteristics,

01:11.320 --> 01:15.320
price, variety, closeness, etc.

01:15.320 --> 01:23.320
So it was a book marketplace in the sense that both the offer and the demand were very fragmented and very heterogeneous.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.320
And in that case, these platforms make more sense.

01:26.320 --> 01:33.320
The monetization was simple, of the value transacted through the platform, we charged a percentage.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.320
We charged, in our case, between 10 and 15% of each transaction.

01:38.320 --> 01:49.320
If you had an average ticket of 20 or 25 euros, you had, it depends, about 2 euros, 3 euros per order that you charged to the restaurant every X days.

01:49.320 --> 01:58.320
As almost all payments were online, we controlled the flow of money and liquidated the money that was appropriate to the restaurants.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.320
From the point of view of segments, at that time, on the side of the offer,

02:04.320 --> 02:14.320
the first category was mainly Chinese, Asian food, then pizza, and then there was a long list of small categories.

02:14.320 --> 02:21.320
In Asian, there was sushi, Chinese, sushi, pizza, and hamburger, that was about 70%.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.320
And it was curious how these proportions were changing, because this was a world,

02:25.320 --> 02:29.320
the world of food in Spain, which was mainly pizza a few years ago,

02:29.320 --> 02:33.320
and it has been changing and now people order anything, even before it was of bad quality,

02:33.320 --> 02:41.320
but, let's say, cheaper, more economical, and now you can order better quality food.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.320
From the point of view of the user, young people, the average age was 27-28 years old,

02:48.320 --> 02:52.320
and we had people, really, that we called heavy users,

02:52.320 --> 02:56.320
who used the platform very continuously through the application,

02:56.320 --> 03:02.320
especially young people who live in apartments, who don't want to cook, and they used it every day.

03:02.320 --> 03:09.320
The delivery, the logistics, since the combination of the restaurant to the user's home,

03:09.320 --> 03:12.320
who takes care of that, who does those resources belong to?

03:12.320 --> 03:18.320
At first, 100% to restaurants, but little by little, to keep increasing our base of restaurants,

03:18.320 --> 03:24.320
there came a time when it was complicated, because, for example, in Madrid we had 90% of the restaurants

03:24.320 --> 03:27.320
that made home food, they were already our clients.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.320
So, of course, there came a time when you couldn't put more restaurants

03:32.320 --> 03:37.320
that already serve home food, so we started putting restaurants that didn't do home service,

03:37.320 --> 03:40.320
and for that you had to offer them the logistics.

03:40.320 --> 03:46.320
So, at first, 100% of the logistics were provided by the restaurants themselves,

03:46.320 --> 03:51.320
and in the end, I think I remember, it was like 80% or 85%.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.320
In Madrid and Barcelona, maybe even 70%.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.320
And that rest was a platform that we had built, called Urban Ninja,

04:00.320 --> 04:05.320
which was a technological layer that, similar to Uber,

04:06.320 --> 04:11.320
put in contact with motorists, restaurants and users,

04:11.320 --> 04:14.320
and then that intermediate logistics was generated.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.320
This was a model that later proliferated, well, in fact, when Rocket Internet bought it,

04:19.320 --> 04:22.320
it separated it from the Red Neck and took it to a lot of countries,

04:22.320 --> 04:25.320
to the point that they generated, I think, I remember,

04:25.320 --> 04:28.320
like half a million orders a month through that logistics platform.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.320
And in fact, when Rocket Internet sold the Red Neck to Just Eat,

04:33.320 --> 04:35.320
they had previously taken out all that part,

04:35.320 --> 04:42.320
they had done what they call a spin-off, a carve-out, of that logistic part of the business.

04:42.320 --> 04:47.320
So, they ended up selling the model, the Red Neck, at the same price as they bought it,

04:47.320 --> 04:50.320
but previously they had extracted a very important part of the value.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.320
So, for them, it was a pretty good operation too.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.320
Let's do a brief analysis of the model, starting from what José told us.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.320
He said that the Red Neck is a book marketplace.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.320
Why? Because it connects supply and demand and also a very fragmented supply,

05:09.320 --> 05:12.320
in which there are no big players, thousands of restaurants,

05:12.320 --> 05:16.320
each of them has a very, very, very small quota on the total of the Red Neck,

05:16.320 --> 05:18.320
and hundreds of thousands of users.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.320
And also, when this particularity occurs in the marketplaces, the marketplace has more value.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.320
Well, let's think about what the Red Neck offers to users.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.320
José has given us a clue, he has told us that it not only connects,

05:29.320 --> 05:33.320
but also provides an extra value, which is to help you choose what you are going to eat or dinner.

05:34.320 --> 05:39.320
Regarding the user segments, he told us that there were some heavy users,

05:39.320 --> 05:43.320
they had identified a percentage, we do not know which one, of heavy users,

05:43.320 --> 05:48.320
which are people who almost every day asked for dinner with the Red Neck.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.320
Therefore, I would say that there are two main segments, sporadic users,

05:52.320 --> 05:57.320
I do not know which one is the recurrence, but maybe once every 15 days, once a month, and heavy users.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.320
Let's think now about what are the segments of customers regarding restaurants.

06:02.320 --> 06:09.320
I believe that the main segmentation is, on the one hand, the restaurants with which the Red Neck began to grow,

06:09.320 --> 06:15.320
which already offered a home food service, therefore, they already had a delivery,

06:15.320 --> 06:20.320
and later they were incorporating restaurants that did not have that logistical structure,

06:20.320 --> 06:23.320
because until that moment they had never sent home food.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.320
And this has many implications, in the value proposition of the Red Neck,

06:28.320 --> 06:32.320
which offers the logistical service, and in the rest of the business model,

06:32.320 --> 06:37.320
because, in addition, the Red Neck at that time had to incorporate additional resources,

06:37.320 --> 06:41.320
such as distributors, motorcycles, etc., which has a cost.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.320
And that's why I think that the main segmentation in terms of restaurants is that,

06:46.320 --> 06:50.320
because they are two segments in which we offer them two different value proposals,

06:50.320 --> 06:53.320
which also have repercussions in the rest of the business model.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.320
And to finish, if we analyze the income flows,

06:57.320 --> 07:02.320
they told us that they charged between 10 and 15% of the entire volume they transacted,

07:03.320 --> 07:09.320
which was around a medium ticket of 25 euros, about 2.5 euros, a little more for each operation.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.320
And they also told us that they charged in advance,

07:13.320 --> 07:17.320
that is, when you make an order, the Red Neck is the one who charges,

07:17.320 --> 07:19.320
it is not directly the restaurant.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.320
Then, the Red Neck, what it does is, it sales to the restaurant,

07:22.320 --> 07:27.320
with a periodicity, the restaurant pays it, not 100% of what it has charged,

07:27.320 --> 07:29.320
but 85% or 90%.

07:30.320 --> 07:35.320
This is something positive in the business model, in the income flow for the Red Neck,

07:35.320 --> 07:39.320
because they do not have paid, and they also have a permanent cash balance,

07:39.320 --> 07:43.320
which allows them to have some comfort,

07:44.320 --> 07:48.320
and above all, avoid having to be permanently claiming

07:48.320 --> 07:52.320
to the restaurants, in this case, the payment of services.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.320
Another positive point of the income flow of the Red Neck

07:57.320 --> 07:59.320
would be related to the recurrence,

07:59.320 --> 08:02.320
with the recurrence that they told us about the heavy users.

08:03.320 --> 08:07.320
You have a percentage of your users, they are people who buy almost every day

08:07.320 --> 08:10.320
and that is generating you recurring and very safe income

08:10.320 --> 08:13.320
for a long period of time.
