00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.870
First we will talk about the

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.170
importance of the fundamentals,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.090
because now everyone, especially

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.050
in the world of digital marketing,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.710
is super specialized in

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.990
very concrete things

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.710
and speaks of Growth Hacking

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.770
and Facebook Ads and the latest

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.970
tool to make a landing

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.250
page, etc., and think

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.530
that is marketing.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.570
What is Marketing?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.630
What do you need to be

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.010
good at to be a great

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.950
marketer?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.010
You have to be very good.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.330
First, you understand your customers

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.590
very well.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.150
We are talking about knowing

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.470
how to segment them well, we

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.090
are talking about deciding who your

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.650
customers are, who are not, understand

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.970
why they are, why they are not, what

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.070
they think of you, why they buy you,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.110
why they don’t buy you, what’s in

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.750
their head, knowing how to quantify

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.690
the size of the market, etc.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.990
Everyone says they understand their

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.070
customers well, but almost no one

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.390
knows how to do it, it’s really, this

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.550
is gold, this is the basis of everything.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.370
After all, what we have to be very

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.490
good is in creating value proposals

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.230
that your customers want to

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.510
buy, which are better than your

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.230
competitors.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.090
This is the engine of everything, this is

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.130
the most important thing of all.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.290
When you have something people want to

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.310
buy, it has happened to us in The Power

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.870
MBA, it’s that everything works,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.150
you’re going like I say always with

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.950
the 700 horsepower engine.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.690
It’s wide, you have to learn

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.290
a lot of things, you have to learn

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.310
to create value proposals,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.910
you have to learn to sell those

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.690
value proposals.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.630
And we will make a differentiation

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.190
here, we can talk about the channel,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.170
that is, how to reach your customers

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.510
and here you enter know how to invest

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.050
in Facebook Ads and things of this,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.470
use the channels, choose which

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.050
channels, invest and so on.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.990
And there is another very important

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.090
competition that helps a lot in everything

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.550
and is that you are able to communicate

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.350
with your customers, that you are

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.470
able to sell your proposal.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.750
And I’m talking about messages,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.850
words, and so on.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.630
And all this is marketing and when

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.910
you are very good at all this you will

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.270
be an excellent marketing.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.170
If you are an expert, then

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.990
nothing will work.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.410
Why is?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.710
Because you don’t have the foundations.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.110
I assure you that it is so that everyone

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.530
is that, super specialized

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.490
such, but they do not have the foundations

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.850
and know how to upload an ad to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.010
Facebook Ads, but it does not turn,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.350
it does not work.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.070
Because they don’t know what they do, they

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.570
don’t know who they really are for, they

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.490
have put the audience, but they don’

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.010
t understand their customers well, they

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.110
don’t know what the most powerful messages

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.130
are, they don’t know how

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.310
to surprise them, etc.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.430
It is an example, but it is very

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.930
common and we check it because

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.450
we are in this, it is so.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.950
So what we’re going to do in this

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.750
marketing fundamentals

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750
course is to set the foundations,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.690
which are absolutely necessary

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.010
so that then when you go building,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250
when you learn digital

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.390
marketing 360, you’ll understand

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.230
all the strategies along

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.710
the funnel, you’ll understand

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.850
it like you’re a CMO when

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.870
you specialize in concrete

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.450
tools.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.910
Practical specialisations, everything

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.550
works, because you have the foundations.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.250
But I tell you, foundations are

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.130
necessary, but this goes beyond

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.950
the foundations.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.850
This is really the most transformative

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.290
of all, it is what puts you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.330
to another level.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.490
Understand your customers well, be

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.050
able to create value proposals that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.630
are potent, know how to communicate

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.390
them, etc.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.110
When you are very good in all

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.270
this, I assure you that you will

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.610
be able to do what you want, you will

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.810
be absolutely differential, it doesn’

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.090
t matter what your goals are, if

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.590
you want to be successful as a marketing

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.030
professional, if you are

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.350
an entrepreneur you will grow your

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.230
company very much, if you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.330
are an entrepreneur, because

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.630
it will be much easier to believe

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.150
a proposal that your customers

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
want to buy, etc.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.570
It is the most important of all.
