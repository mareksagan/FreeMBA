00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.760
Before we explain what

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.980
OKR is, what we will do

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.800
is, let’s analyze what

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.440
problems it solves.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.980
Well, I think it’s a very common

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.220
or almost common problem that all

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.960
companies have and it doesn’t matter

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.900
whether they are large or small.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.560
We could call it the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.780
disconnect.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.820
That is, the company has strategic

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.660
goals and then you have people

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.780
in the company.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.580
You have a lot of staff,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.400
etc.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.120
Well, what happens is that many

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.740
times or almost always those

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.980
employees go to their workplace

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.880
and do things, do tasks.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.000
And usually each person tends

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.320
to measure their productivity according

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.400
to having done those tasks

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.300
that in some cases he himself

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.540
has assigned or assigned

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.160
to his superior or whatever.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.460


00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.760
One day you go home quietly if you think

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.740
you have been very productive

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.260
because you have finished what you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.920
have been ordered or the task you

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.220
have commissioned yourself.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.260
Well, what happens is that there

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.720
is always a huge disallow

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.480
between the company’

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.780
s strategic goals, the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.100
creation of real value and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.500
what people do.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.820
And in many cases there are a lot of

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.520
people doing a lot of things that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.300
do them well.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.040
They do it well, they do it in time

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.880
and they do it in good shape.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.960
But what happens is that they don’

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.060
t contribute to creating real value to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.580
the company.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.820
And this is a nonsense because

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.840
in the end what you are doing is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.960
having resources that are

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.820
not contributing to the strategic goals.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.740
OKR also helps us to answer

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.380
many things such as how to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.660
organize teams, how to distribute

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.820
tasks, how to assign goals,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.760
how to follow up, etc.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.020
The first thing I will do is explain

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.220
what it consists of.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.480
You will see that it is a very simple method.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.480
And after explaining the method,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.060
we will review at the end

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.960
of the class what the main

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.280
benefits OKR has.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.440
OKR is a technique

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.820
of planning and setting goals

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.880
and distributing those goals

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.740
in cascade throughout the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.680
organization.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.820
Basically it is that.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.940
This is a technique that is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.760
being used by the best managed companies

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.780
in the world.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960
Amazon, Zalando, Dropbox,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.740
Facebook, all are using OKR.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.640
And lately all the startups that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.140
are the most innovative,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.840
best managed companies, etc.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.360
They are incorporating OKR.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.440
It is clear that it has

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.740
huge benefits.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.140
The pioneer was Google.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.720
Google was the first

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.000
major company to start using

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.960
OKR to set goals, to track.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.940
Well, how does it work?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.420
First, I’ll give you an example

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.300
on the screen.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.440
OKR is objective and key results.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.640
Key objectives and results.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.180
This is an example, right?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.180
We have a goal and we have

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.020
key results.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.520
Now I will describe each of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.040
them, the goals they are.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.540
In the goals, what we

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.920
determine is where we want to get.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.200
They are goals that must be

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.780
challenging, aspirational,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.180
that must be inspiring for

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.540
people, even motivating.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.840
And we also have to make an

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.120
effort so that the goals are

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.680
simple, easy to understand,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.400
etc.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.460
Objectives are not measurable, they

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.360
are not quantitative, they are

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.320
qualitative.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.720
And if we go back to the example,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.900
we have an objective that is, for

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.040
example, we’ll think about a company

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.860
goal, right?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.100
It is about launching a new product successfully.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.140


00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.900
It is something aspirational, it is something challenging.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.520
This is a strategic goal for the company.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.060
Now, I’ll tell you what

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.020
the key results are.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.680
The key results are the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.480
intermediate results that will

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.160
allow us to that goal.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.980
In this case, they are measurable.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.080
Basically what allows us to know

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.740
the key results is whether we

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.540
are on the right track to reach

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.140
that goal.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.460
And if we go back to the example,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.880
in this case the goal is to successfully

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.400
launch a new product and what

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.480
we have to do is define

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.380
key results.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.920
It is recommended that it be, for example,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.160
between three and five.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.440
We don’t have to put too many

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.680
because then when there are

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.040
too many key results in the

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.540
end we end up losing or we don’

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.580
t measure any of them.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.660
What are the key results to

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.120
a goal such as successfully

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.640
launching a new product?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.980
For example, the product

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.020
is released for a certain

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.320
date.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.760
We sell 10,000 units in

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.920
the first year.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.020
For example, the NPS is

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.040
a percentage.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.640
Have a good NPS.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.080
We will, as you can see,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.360
what we are doing is to break

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.860
that goal into key outcomes that

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.720
really allow us to focus

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.200
on those outcomes.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.260
They are more manageable, they are more measurable.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.920
More recommendations regarding

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.680
key results?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.960
Well, keep in mind that the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.500
key results are not tasks.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.700
The tasks are, it is a lower level.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.700
That is, to any of those key

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.960
results you will have to

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.220
do the tasks you want.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.500
You have to define them.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.200
It is a higher level, let’s say,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.680
more detailed, more tactical.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.000
As I said, key results allow

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.240
us to know whether we are on

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.580
the right track or not

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.780
to that goal.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.620
Things we have to take into account.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.780
OKR is a planning system that,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.100
mainly, the main benefit is

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.140
that it allows us to align

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.400
what the entire organization

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.740
does with, everyone, with

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.340
strategic goals.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.640
Well, what we have to do

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.960
is different OKRs at different

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.620
levels.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.740
This is key, it’s like a waterfall,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.440
right?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.160
So we have to have an OKR that

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.240
is strategic.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.980
Imagine they’re for the board of

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.580
directors or for the CEO, for

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.980
the company in general.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.160
Like the one we’ve seen before,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.400
launch a new product.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.680
But then we have to go defining

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.420
the OKRs at the different

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.380
levels.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.200
What we can do is

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.560
three levels.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.580
At the level of the organization, at the

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.980
level of the company, for each of the teams.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.060
You also have to have a personal OKR.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.920
And what is very important is that

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.000
everything has to be related, because

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.020
otherwise we would not be

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.960
achieving the goal.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.920
Let us see an example.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.880
We’ve seen an OKR at the company level

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.360
before that’s successfully launching

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.420
a new product.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.940
With key results, key results,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.660
such as having launched the

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.880
product for a certain date,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.720
having sold X units in

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.460
the first year, for example,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.280
or the NPS.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.380
Well, from those goals,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.940
what we have to do is

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.760
define the OKRs of the

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.880
lower levels.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.740
Let’s think, for example, of an

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.600
OKR for the marketing department.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.540
It must be designed,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.240
defined, so that the goals

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.300
above are achieved.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.720
You probably understand it already.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.820
In this case, the goal for the marketing

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.440
department is to successfully

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.460
launch marketing campaigns.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.580
We will define the key results.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.800
I would like to put 3 again, but as

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.900
I said, it could be between 3 and 5.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.480
It’s usually a recommendation, right?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.820
What do we need to measure at

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.340
the marketing level to this goal?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.140
In turn, the strategic objective

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.600
is achieved.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.920
For example, we have launched

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.360
marketing campaigns

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.580
for a certain date.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.220
We have to work hard on this

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.240
because they have to be launched

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.760
at that date.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.160
We would have to generate

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.760
100,000 leads in the first

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.240
year.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.980
And what we need to do is

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.280
optimize the conversion

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.620
rates to reach 10%.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.580
And so we would be achieving the

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.300
sales we had defined for the CEO

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.740
at the company level.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.540
As you can see, it is encasched

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.880
at the company level, at the team

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.300
level, and then each person has to

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.920
have their OKRs.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.680
It helps you to be permanently

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.540
focused on your

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.120
team’s goals and strategic

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.340
goals.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.950
Now let’s look at how the time

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.810
planning of the OKR is.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.630
How much is determined, how

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.470
is followed.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.210
Well, what I want you to keep

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.570
in mind is that it is flexible.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.530
It is usually recommended to have annual

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.350
OKRs and also a quarterly

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.370
OKR and to follow up on

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.530
a quarterly basis.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.950
That is, you with the periodicity

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.790
with which you determine them, what

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.330
you have to do is sit down with the

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.390
people of each of the teams

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.370
and quickly have one, so that,

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.890
analyze whether we are on the

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.010
right path or not.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.250
Because this is very important.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.270
The OKRs allow us to know permanently

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.090
whether the entire organization

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.070
is on the right track, is heading

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.210
towards strategic goals

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.230
or not.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.110
It’s not about evaluating

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.990
people, this is more strategic, right?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.930
As I said, time

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.550
planning is flexible.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.110
Because you could define OKRs with

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.230
much shorter deadlines for much

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.850
more concrete projects.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.090
If your organization is very

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.050
dynamic, if you have many

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.490
projects in progress, you could

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.990
define them for specific projects.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.210
The methodology is, as you said,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.510
defines an OKR with a time limit.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.770
It has to be, it has to make sense

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.950
to be aligned with the type of

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.150
goal you set with the deadline.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.190
That is, if you want

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.090
a long-term goal, very

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.330
ambitious, etc., well,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.430
because that will

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.610
stay in time.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.690
All this is pure common sense.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.490
What is recommended is that, with

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.390
the periodicity you have

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.050
determined, you meet with people

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.030
and an evaluation is made.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.430
Then, a scale of 0 to 1 or 0 to

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.030
10 is determined for each of

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.990
the key results.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.170
So what we do is sit with each

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.570
of the people and value

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.490
themselves.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.950
This key result, how are you?

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.150
From 0 to 10, in a 5, in a 6, in a

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.350
such, in which, it is seen like this.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.870
If all key results have been

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.210
achieved with a 10, it is probably

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.570
because we have set

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.390
unsettling goals.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.350
We need to be more ambitious.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.910
If, however, none of the key results

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.070
has been achieved, we are all

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.950
in a 1, in a 2, for example,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.910
it is that we have not set

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.390
well neither the goals nor the

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.090
key results.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.010
I think it is quite common sense.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.350
And, by the way, another thing

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.850
I want to nuance is that OKR

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.110
is not an evaluation tool.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.670
That is, it is not a

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.250
tool for assessing performance.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.370
That is another system.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.070
It serves you to see, to evaluate

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.550
the teams, but it is not

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.950
directly meant for that.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.970
It is not intended, for example,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.370
to condition bonuses or payments

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.410
or salary increases to the OKR.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.130
OKR is a strategic tool that will

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.230
help us, as I have already said

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.970
several times, to align what

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.430
the entire organization does

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.090
with strategic goals.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.370
It is not thought of itself so that

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.730
you condition what you will pay them

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.170
or, for example, the OKR.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.530
Although, as you’re sure thinking,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.750
when we implement this we have

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.450
a lot of information about

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.770
how each of the team’s members

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.090
are doing it.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.990
This information will help

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.450
us to assess the performance

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.410
of each individual.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.830
But it is not thought of for that.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.590
It is not a performance assessment system.
