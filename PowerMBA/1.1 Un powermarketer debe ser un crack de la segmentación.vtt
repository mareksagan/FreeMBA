WEBVTT

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.340
We are talking about segmentation variables.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.960
Usually what is done is that

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.320
they are grouped in four, for

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.140
example, in four blocks and in

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.420
those groups you lose a lot.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.500
We have done it to try to identify

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.980
all or almost all of the most

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.920
important ones, we leave

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.740
you the listing and you have to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.320
go assimilating them and from

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.620
now on every time you study

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.580
or think or analyze a market

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.320
or a company or whatever

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.300
you have to incorporate

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.600
this and it will help you

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
see things clearer.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.860
On the one hand, we study

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.180
the customers themselves,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.180
regardless of our proposal

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.620
and in the second block it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.320
is related to our proposal,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.800
what they look for in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220
us, how they see us, etc.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.700
Let's start with the customer itself.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.280
of geographical variables.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.600
Well, because segments depending on where

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.560
they live, very easy.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.700
Demographic variables are.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.800
For in this case, they are typical

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.600
of age, sex, religion, I know

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.820
the studies, the profession,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.000
things like that.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.940
The firmographic variables

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.460
are demographic for companies.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
The firm is a company.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.600
You don't study religion or

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
gender in a company, you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.160
study the size of the company,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.580
the activity, the number of employees,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.760
the turnover, and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.720
so on.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.700
Psychological variables are.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.500
This is the profile and this was very

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.840
fashionable We identified profiles.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.280
Imagine, urban, pijo, I know, adventurer,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.000
traveler, things like that, that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.300
gives us certain information.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.060
I will give you some examples, well.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.060
Psychological variables are.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.160
We made a project years ago with a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.860
pharmaceutical laboratory that what

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.540
one of its distribution channels

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.760
was pharmacies, the pharmacy offices

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.220
that is called and I think we segmented

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.700
10,000 pharmacies and segmented

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
them in function, we made a segmentation

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.220
among other psychographic

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.200
and what we segmented was

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.760
in terms of the profile, the profile

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.020
of the pharmacist or the businessman,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.760
in terms of being more businessman,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.340
more innovative, because

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.140
with desires to do different

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.100
things, etc., or that it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.440
was more traditional,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.980
more conservative,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.360
less businessman.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.760
In the sector the segments that

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.040
were or were made were more firmographic

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.560
or demographic, size, square

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160
meters, proximity to a medical

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.060
center, things like that.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.020
This is what we did, we want to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.140
understand who the people who are

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.640
running those pharmacies are.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.300
And why?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.640
Because that psychographic segmentation

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.720
allowed that laboratory to adapt the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.080
proposal, which is the only important

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.740
thing, to the one who was more entrepreneurial,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.520
innovative, etc., because

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.820
they offered a series of services

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.260
and those services connected

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.340
with them, but did not connect

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.240
with the most conservative.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.100
Another variable related to the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.980
profile is latitudinal.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.100
What do your customers or your target

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.680
market think about specific things?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.020
How do you react to concrete things?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.920
What opinion do you have?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.960
This is not understandable, but I will

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.780
give you an example of Power MBA.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.660
We one day realized that we told

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.740
the proposal to two people who

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.620
from the perspectives above,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.080
from all the others were equal,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.980
the same age, live in the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.640
same place, the same profession,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420
the same studies, the same

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.100
profile, apparently all

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.700
the same, all four above equal.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.520
And this person fell in love with

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.520
our proposal and the other person

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.360
was shaking him and we said, But

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.080
what are we losing?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.240
What is missing here?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.660
It was a purely behavioral issue.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.720
We understand that there are people,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.540
among you, among the Power Marketers,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.940
among the Power MBAs, well, all the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.400
Power Marketers or the Power MBAs are

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.700
so, that they have an attitude towards

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.380
learning, and it is that learning

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.540
and knowledge consider them

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.040
to serve for something, but the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.560
rest of the world, which is the vast

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.940
majority, do not believe that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.860
learning serves you for nothing.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.400
But they do not learn from the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.600
things they do, because

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.300
they don't believe it so.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.660
Look, it is a purely attitude

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.500
topic, but in this case it gives

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.580
us a lot of information,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.000
because we had to address

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.240
only people who believe that

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.500
learning serves something.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.040
And understanding this helped

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.380
us evolve a lot of copies, messages,

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.400
ads and so on.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.520
There are ads that connect

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.700
with people based on the attitude

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.220
they have.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.000
So consider this variable, which

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.860
is the attitude.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.100
In some cases it makes sense and in

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.540
others not.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.680
Now let's go with the variables

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.760
that are related to your

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.060
proposal, what they look for in

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.760
you, how they are as customers, etc.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.640
It is no longer the client,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.540
but the customer

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.220
with you.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.140
The first one, which I put

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.740
above all, is the benefits.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.620
and benefits.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.740
For what purpose, or for what purpose.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.140
Do it, always

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.380
Segment your customers and target

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.760
audience according to that.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.420
This is what the most valuable information

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.340
will bring you.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.000
You get a lot more information, knowing

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080
your thousands of customers.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.080
If there are segments that buy you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.660
with specific and different

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.200
goals, that is to know the age,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920
gender or things of those or profiles.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.220
Why is?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.500
The most important thing is

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.880
the profit you get from them.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.400
And when you understand it, it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.620
allows you to adapt a lot more.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.360
I'll go back to the Power MBA.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.840
Two years ago we were segmenting in

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.400
function, we were doing demographic segmentations.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.220
The age, studies, junior or senior,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.780
or for example your situation

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.080
as long as you worked for another

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.380
person, i.e. for another company,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.700
account of others, or was an

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.000
entrepreneur, etc.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.120
That is the demographic.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.200
But we realized that segmentation,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.520
the variable that brought us the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.060
most valuable information, was not

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.440
that, it was the benefit.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.100
Regardless of your current situation,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.940
why did you buy us?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.560
With what purpose?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.680
What benefit did he want?

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.380
And what are they?

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.420
There are several, but get inspired

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.840
to update, get inspired to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.420
start, to launch a new company.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.340
Regardless of whether I had to work

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.680
in a large company, I would

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.700
have been the age I was.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.000
Even though I was an entrepreneur, sometimes

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.140
what I wanted was to get inspired to create

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.160
something more innovative.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.000
Others are updating.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.440
Others, find a better job.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.140
The benefits they are looking for.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.880
And when we segment the audience according

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.080
to the benefits, we understand

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.320
a lot of things that allowed

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.740
us to improve our relationship

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.880
with them, make new campaigns,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.600
etc.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.640
You must always keep this

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.280
in mind.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.260
Another way to see it is the problem.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.480
Sometimes it is the same, have you seen

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.880
them from another perspective?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.420
What are your problems or what

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.500
benefit do you seek?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.720
It makes you more intuitive.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.540
And for example, I'll think of,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.660
I know, a personal trainer.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.740
No, a coach

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.880
A coach or a psychologist, I know,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.820
well, because you will have

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.680
clients who feel different problems.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.300
That is a good segmentation.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.460
Sometimes the problem determines

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.700
the benefit they are looking for in

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.040
you.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.560
Another related, but that

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.840
is good to have in mind, is

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.720
that of everything you offer,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.820
usually a value proposal

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.980
has as many components.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.040
What are you most valuing?

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.780
Well, blablacar, for example, there

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.240
are users who value saving

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.840
money, others making money,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.440
well.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.300
In The Power Envie there are people

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.320
who value the cases, others

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.580
value the cross knowledge of the

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.920
entire program, of all areas,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.360
the power marketers equally.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.040
This is interesting.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.740
Segment your current customers according

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.200
to everything I offer them,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.340
which is what they are valuing.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.860
It can give you many clues.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.460
Use, this also helps to understand

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.460
many things.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.280
We have to segment by use.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.000
By use I do not mean the volume of

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.520
use, the amount of use, but how we

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.980
are used, how, for what they

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.420
use us.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.820
I give you an example.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.600
For the gym, there are people who go

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.420
to the gym, because at noon, as

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.540
we have seen before, because

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.920
they work around and others go at

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.360
night.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.660
Or there are people who go to gain

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.920
muscle mass and others to gas.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.280
Or there are people who go, for example,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.620
a hairdressing chain, because

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.200
you have customers, you can

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.000
segment customers by use.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.460
You are not even segmenting not the

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.000
customer, but because a customer

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.580
can, sometimes can use you,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.360
because every three months he

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.640
will cut, every two months he

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.180
will cut his hair, or also, because

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.260
on Saturdays in the morning,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.820
many customers go to events.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.820
Introduce this variable of use, which

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.180
will give you many clues of many

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.740
things.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.200
The relationship with us, you

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.420
can segment according to your current

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.460
or potential customers according

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.700
to the relationship you have with

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.200
them.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.740
If they already know you, that is, in

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.400
the funnel they are very up, they

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.840
already know you, they don't know you,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.160
they have already bought you, well, it'

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.620
s segmenting if you do actions adapted to

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.140
each of them.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.680
Segmentation by behavior that

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.740
can be related and is based

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.340
on specific things they have

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.760
done.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.860
I know if they have opened an email,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.780
or if they have visited your website

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.660
or if they have bought you, etc.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.100
You are adapting, right?

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.600
We are talking about current

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.140
customers.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.580
Other very common segmentations

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.100
are the segmentations based on

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.380
the frequency, the importance

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.680
as a customer of what they

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.440
are buying you.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.920
For example, in B2B companies, ABC

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.880
is very typical.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.140
Your customers are the ones that

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.260
buy you the most, the most

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.440
important ones for you, the ones

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.620
that generate almost all the billing,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.440
and you do what you do because you

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.860
assign them a Key Account Manager,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.700
you focus on them, etc.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.140
The B, because a little less, you

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.500
deal with distributors and the C

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.420
are those that buy you

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.560
sporadically, for example.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.860
It is very common, I know, or an

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.160
application, because it always

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.340
has identified who are the

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.020
heavy users who use it most, etc.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.000
This is the level of satisfaction.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.320
You can segment up or down, because

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.880
those who are more faithful are happier,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.760
etc., and they value you well

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.980
and those who have complained.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.240
You can do a segmentation like that,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.640
right?

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.780
Anyone who complains, we

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.880
will call you.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.360
This is a segmentation and an adaptation,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.980
in this case, of your value proposition

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.980
or your relationship

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.980
with them, right?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.180
We call on everyone who complains.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.880
The last one we have incorporated

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.520
is that segments depending on

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.220
whether they are looking

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.580
for a proposal like yours or

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.340
of the competition or not.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.680
This will be seen in a class later,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.740
because if you are able to

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.220
target those who are not looking

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.300
for it, well, you are expanding

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.800
the size of the market.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.860
As you can see, there

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.240
are many analyses.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.780
For each of the perspectives you

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.840
will come out a few segments and you

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.660
what you have to do is know

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.020
them all, try to apply them

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.120
to see if in your case, in your

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.360
company, in your project, whatever,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.560
which have meaning.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.120
Some will make sense and will provide

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.100
you with a lot of information and allow

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.800
you to adapt a lot and others in your

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.380
case, because they will not have.
