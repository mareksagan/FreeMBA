00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.040
Cris, let’s see how we can manage

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.640
human capital, this is super broad,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.800
but we need a method, a formula

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.560
that helps us to set goals,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.320
evaluate, develop, help those who

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580
reach those goals, this is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460
usually the Orthodox form,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.520
that is, it includes many things,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.420
because performance management,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720
development management, etc.,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.180
but what we’re going to do

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.020
is a unique method, right?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.340
That’s a process, we’ll explain

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.640
it as if it were an annual process,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.740
well, we’ll call it the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.800
employee cycle, well?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.980
So this first process begins

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.340
with a phase that is the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.720
setting of goals, right?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.820
At the same time you set those

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.760
goals, you have to set some KPIs,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.320
right? some measurement systems

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.220
of those goals to see that they

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.660
are improving and that they are

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.020
being met, right?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.440
And how is this done?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.220
This, when setting goals,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.620
you have to follow the MARTE

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.080
rule, that is, a business goal

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.880
has to be measurable, right?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.160
It cannot be etheric, it cannot be

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.420
anything generic because that leads

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.680
to frustration, to a dismotivation,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.200
right? something you can’t

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.100
measure.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600
Then it has to be achievable, that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.880
is, it has to, well, because being

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.800
realistic based on, heh, you don’t

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000
ask for an impossible goal, right?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
You have to be realistic and reckless,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.620
right?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.720
It can’t be something impossible, but

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.060
on the other hand it can’t be something

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.740
easy or that doesn’t mean, it doesn’

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.520
t have an impact on the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.340
benefits, right?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.120
It has to be fixed in

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.100
time, right?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.140
You can’t set a goal without measuring,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.180
that is, you have to tame

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.920
it and say, hear, this year we have

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.740
to do, then, a number of sales

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.680
or a number of products or a number

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.500
of things, right?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.180
And then it has to be achievable,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.480
what we said.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.380
It can’t be something impossible because it’

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.200
s dismotivating, but it can’t be something

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.020
that doesn’t motivate you at a challenge

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.720
level, right?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940
That’s what common sense seems,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.920
we always say, right?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.980
It seems common sense.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.320
The target is Mars and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.000
everyone has heard

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.300
of it, Mars.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.920
But it is that when the goals

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.660
are set, it is necessary to take

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.720
into account because many times

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.100
these requirements are not met

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.600
and at the end it is not

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.060
useful.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.760
And then it also serves you a little

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.300
to be efficient, to have an organizational

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.120
and business efficiency,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.940
right?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960
Because in the end only people

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.000
who are targeted are efficient

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.620
in their work because if

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.680
you don’t know what you have

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.140
to do, that is, you can be

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.520
wasting time and that means

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.220
a waste of money and time

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.260
for everyone that is not

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.760
efficient.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.020
Working is not about doing tasks,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.400
it is about contributing to business

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.760
goals and everything else is worthless.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.420


00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.900
Well, that’s a topic, that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.940
is, the goals you set have to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.200
be aligned with the strategic goals.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.480
That is, they have to be based on

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.840
the position each occupies in the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.100
organization, right?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.060
And then they also have to comply

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.160
with the Mars rule, measurable,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.140
reachable, challenging, timely

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.820
and specific, right?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.240
That on one side.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.140
The first step is the setting

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.200
of goals.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.540
And how do we do it?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.380
You meet with your colleagues

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.360
at the beginning of the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
year, right?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.040
One to one.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.060
And set those individual

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.780
goals of each based on the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.780
company’s goals and position.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.420
Well, then I want to see some

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.020
example.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.520
And you set the goals and set

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.380
the metrics or KPIs with which

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.380
we will follow up on those

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.060
goals.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.980
actually is.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.300
If you want, let us give examples.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.580
For example, a salesman, because you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.120
set him an annual sales target,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.620
right?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.200
With a KPI, logically, then of market

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.560
share, for example, what would be

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.120
the expected result, the KPI,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.000
right?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.180
This would be a goal of a sales

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.120
person, for example.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.260
A human resource person,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.360
for example.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.060
Improve the working environment.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100
Well, then you have to design

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.680
a work climate survey to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.960
launch employees.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.000
That is the objective.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.640
How will we measure it?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.240
The launch of the survey,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.400
that in addition the results

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.980
are favorable or there has been an

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.100
improvement would be a KPI, right?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.780
For example, a human

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.860
resource person.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.880
And then a person, for example,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.000
customer service, right?

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.060
For example, the satisfaction

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.820
survey.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.920
and exact.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.540
For example, hear, then, that

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.960
90% of our customer satisfaction

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.020
surveys have a higher

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.600
rating to a specific score

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.700
this year, right?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.100
That and, for example, the number

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.100
of calls, right?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.860
That is, right?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.500
To be clear and concrete,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.720
right?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.040
Those are the examples of three

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.100
different people in different departments,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.320
right?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.800
So once you have had that

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.720
meeting with your collaborator

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.060
to set their goals, in

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.560
that meeting you also have

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.420
to set some development

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.540
goals.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.980
Why is?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.420
Because you have to help your

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.920
collaborator those goals that you

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.280
have as a company and on an

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.200
individual level.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.920
So, based on that, and I’ll explain

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920
it with the examples we’ve

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.860
put, we set up a few development

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.200
goals, right?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.900
Imagine, then, I, who am the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.040
seller, have set me a few

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.800
sales goals, right?

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.440
I need to develop

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.940
my trading skills to

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.260
these sales goals.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.440
It is a bit focused on overcoming

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.300
weaknesses or power.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.880
It is to develop areas of improvement

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.320
that each person has.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.940
We all have things to improve.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.740
And what happens is that we

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.420
have to help our people focus

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.900
on those areas of improvement

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.880
to develop them and the

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.340
company’s goals.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.480
That is, we will make individualized

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.220
development plans with each

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.820
of the people to the

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.220
business goals we have

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.060
set for them.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.440
That is, that is.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.560
These are development goals.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.540
That is, they also have to be

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.620
measurable, attainable, challenging,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.860
time-fixed and specific, right?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.960
And we’ll follow the same measurement

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.660
system, so to speak, right?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.400
Then we set business and

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.900
development goals at a

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.140
first meeting at the beginning

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.040
of the year.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.640
Give them some example

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.020
of initiatives or development

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.600
plans to the goals

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.540
we have seen.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.900
Is it true of the specific examples?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.640
Yes, with any of them.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.440
We talked about the seller,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.400
right?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.560
Yes, we said that he needed

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.400
to develop his negotiation skills.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.540
well is.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.120
We have provided a specialized

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.160
sales consultancy.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.700
well is.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.920
well is.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.000
Or we send you for 15 days with another

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.360
seller that is very good at that,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.940
for example.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.160
For example, it may be.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.720
Because in the end what we

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.120
also have to be clear when

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.880
designing development

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.360
plans is that people, there

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.180
is a rule that says that

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.880
people learn, 70% of the things

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.560
we learn we learn through

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.580
learning experiences.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.340
It is good to do things.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.080
20% of what we learn is learned

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.240
in the relationship with our

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.680
colleagues, managers, customers,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.820
collaborators, which is learning

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.240
from others, so to speak.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.400
And then 10% we learn it based

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.340
on traditional formations,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.640
which can be the presence formations,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.620
online, what is understood

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.600
by a training or

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.840
a specific course.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.180
Then, depending on these modes

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.760
or learning opportunities,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.500
you, based on the goal

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.760
you have of development, can

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.100
tell this seller, for example,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.060
to go on a market visit with

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.960
the best seller you have

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.740
on your team.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, for example, to learn from

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.480
the best.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280
Or even a sales consultancy.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.580
Or, in addition, have meetings

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.500
with him to teach.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.800
That is, these are different development

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.940
or learning actions that you

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.560
can design in that development plan.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.120
Well, I’ll do a recapitulation.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.620
First the meeting, we set a business

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.960
goal, validated with the

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.880
other person.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.140
Everything is very well agreed, very consensual.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.320
We set up KPIs, what metrics

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.660
we will use, what indicators

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.300
we will use to see if those

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.920
goals are achieved or not.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.000


00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.840
And then what we do is, we will

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.380
help you through development

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.840
plans or initiatives

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.800
to those goals.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.600
Well, and that’s there, the meeting

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.540
ends, it’s signed...

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.780
In the end, it is a commitment

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.120
that you can sign.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.300
Word, Excel, or whatever you want.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.840
A document signed by both the

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.720
manager and the collaborator.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.200
And what they do is, in a second phase

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.400
of the process, since a while has passed,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.940
because that is already determined with

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.860
your manager or your collaborator.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.720
That is, listen, because we

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.880
will be setting up to follow

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.200
up on this plan, either

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.580
quarterly or semi-monthly

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.820
or monthly.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.060
That’s what you define with your employees.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.960
This is the second meeting you have.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.840
Follow-up and feedback.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.200
Well, there are several of those.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.900
The ones you set in the year.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.760
Depending on the follow-up you want

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.160
to do, whether it is monthly, bimensional,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.880
quarterly or semestral, there will

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.800
be a bit of a percentage of meetings

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.640
of that type.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.020
So, in that meeting basically

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.220
is, with that template, you’

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.860
ll see how you’re

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.060
achieving the goals.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.580
For what?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.640
One of two.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.320
Or to correct if there is any

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.260
goal that is not being met or to continue

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.120
motivating it to continue to

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.320
be achieved as is being demonstrated.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.060
The same goes for development goals.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.920
Hear, it turns out that you already

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.120
had that training in sales and now

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.320
we have noticed that, that you come

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.800
out with the best of the

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.120
sellers so that you learn.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.420
The follow-up meeting is scheduled.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.120
It is very logical.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.560
At the end of the day, it is to see how things are going.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.300
actually is.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.400
It is a follow-up and feedback.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.200
And then it would be the last meeting,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.660
which is at the end of the year, which

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.060
is where all the annual performance

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.260
that the collaborator has had

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.820
is assessed, whether or not

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820
the goals have been achieved.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.020
And on the basis of that assessment,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.840
the retroduction systems we

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.820
have talked about in other occasions,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.060
such as a bonus or commercial

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.560
incentives, or a flexible

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.460
retroduction, will be

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.260
established.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.400
and perfect.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.700
It is an annual process in which

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.580
we set goals that must be aligned

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580
with those of the company,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.040
which must meet the criterion

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.680
that it is on Mars.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.300
development plans to them.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.480
And then what we do is be close

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.280
to the collaborators, because if

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.940
what you do is the first meeting,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.260
then you forget for when

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.060
you come back.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.480
There may have been so

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.920
much disconnect that it is...

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.860
It is important that feedback

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.920
is continuous.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.020
Because you can’t wait until the

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.860
end of the year to give feedback to

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.320
your collaborator because you missed

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.180
a brutal opportunity or motivate

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.520
or correct it.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.980
Then in the end, some inefficiencies

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.260
are lost, then feedback

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.500
has to be constant.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.900
You can then formalize it or not

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.460
with this type of meetings, but

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.720
the feedback has to be constant.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.800
It is that these things are done

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.420
well, it is that they must be done

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.680
well, that is, they cannot be done halfway.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.920
Take time.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.240
You can go to a busy businessman

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.240
and think that this

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.900
is a...

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.340
And at the end you don’t have time

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.160
and you know it would be fine, but you

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.180
leave it aside and so.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.480
This is what happens to

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.460
many entrepreneurs.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.360
But it is that in the end you have

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.220
to make an effort because both the

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.800
entrepreneur and his collaborators

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.140
interiorize this process.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.840
Because that’s the only way

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.060
they get out naturally.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.700
If you have to do this and

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.540
you have to...

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.360
This is not a human resource process,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.060
this is a business process.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.640
It is entirely strategic.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.520
It is strategic.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.060
Then you have to make your people

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.000
interiorize it so that that continuous

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.760
feedback is carried out because

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.800
it is the only way to your goals

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.180
and to improve and continue

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.180
to develop the business.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.180
and perfect.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.200
So much thanks.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.140
It is fine, eh?
