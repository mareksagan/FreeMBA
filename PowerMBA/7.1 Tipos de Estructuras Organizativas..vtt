00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
There have always been three types of usual organisational structures,

00:09.760 --> 00:13.040
which are functional, we divide by functions,

00:13.040 --> 00:17.560
divisional, we structure in different divisions,

00:17.560 --> 00:20.240
matricial, which is the combination of the two above,

00:20.240 --> 00:22.920
and by projects, which is the current trend.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.600
We start with functional organisations.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.200
In this case, what is it? It is very simple, we see it on the screen.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.640
We are going to structure the organisation

00:33.640 --> 00:38.200
being redundant the different functions that are within a company,

00:38.200 --> 00:41.000
which is what you can understand by departments,

00:41.000 --> 00:47.800
marketing, sales, finance, operations, systems, etc.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.120
What are the benefits of this? Well, it has certain benefits.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.080
They are simpler structures.

00:53.080 --> 00:58.920
Usually, small companies are structured almost naturally.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.680
What we achieve is that many synergies are generated,

01:01.680 --> 01:06.400
because you get people to work who have some knowledge,

01:06.400 --> 01:12.040
some skills, some very concrete experiences, and the same ones.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.640
Those from the finance department, well, they all know about finance,

01:14.640 --> 01:17.480
and they work together and they understand each other well.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.880
That said, the simplicity we have seen, the synergies, etc.,

01:21.880 --> 01:26.680
functional organisations have a big drawback,

01:26.680 --> 01:30.360
and that is that you are structuring the organisation

01:30.360 --> 01:34.360
in a way that is not aligned with the strategic objectives,

01:34.360 --> 01:38.240
because in the end you are creating departments,

01:38.240 --> 01:40.800
let's think about finance, marketing, etc.,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.880
that measure their productivity,

01:42.880 --> 01:46.440
they have objectives that they don't have to have in mind

01:46.440 --> 01:49.840
the real or strategic objectives of the company.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.520
I'm going to give you an example. Let's think about the product department.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.240
The product department, in the end, will be measured by,

01:57.240 --> 02:01.840
imagine, by producing X products a year, etc.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.560
But it is very possible that they don't have in mind the client,

02:04.560 --> 02:06.600
that they don't have in mind the client experience,

02:06.600 --> 02:10.520
and that means that sometimes we use products

02:10.520 --> 02:12.800
that you say, but what were they thinking about?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.280
Because it is obvious that they had forgotten about the client,

02:15.280 --> 02:17.720
and this is the result of that.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.240
It is the result of the fact that the product design

02:20.240 --> 02:22.920
did not take into account the client,

02:22.920 --> 02:28.160
and it is usually a consequence of a functional structure.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.320
Another disadvantage, which is closely related to this,

02:31.320 --> 02:33.880
is that employees lose sight,

02:33.880 --> 02:38.760
because what happens is that they are in their function,

02:38.760 --> 02:42.480
but they lose sight of the strategic objectives

02:42.480 --> 02:46.120
or how their work affects or contributes to the objectives,

02:46.120 --> 02:48.120
and this generates dismotivation.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.040
You become very specialist, very functional.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.360
And the third disadvantage is that communication is very bad

02:54.360 --> 02:57.960
between departments, because in the end,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.680
you think about finance and marketing.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.400
Well, they are different people, with different training,

03:03.400 --> 03:06.160
with different objectives, that are not absolutely,

03:06.160 --> 03:09.160
they have no motivation to understand each other,

03:09.160 --> 03:11.360
in fact, they are not usually understood,

03:11.360 --> 03:14.000
and when one has to get into the work of the other,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.680
it is usually seen as if they are touching your nose,

03:17.680 --> 03:19.680
in a way.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.040
Now we are going to analyze the structures

03:23.040 --> 03:25.360
or the divisional organizations.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.120
In this case, what we do is organize ourselves

03:28.120 --> 03:29.600
according to different divisions.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.920
The divisions can be by geographies,

03:32.920 --> 03:35.640
imagine that we structure the whole organization

03:35.640 --> 03:39.120
according to the different countries in which we are,

03:39.120 --> 03:41.120
or maybe it is a smaller law firm,

03:41.120 --> 03:43.520
imagine that we have a headquarters in Madrid,

03:43.520 --> 03:45.520
another in Barcelona and another in Valencia,

03:45.520 --> 03:47.520
and we create divisions.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.520
Or, for example, we can create divisions by products.

03:50.520 --> 03:56.120
Imagine that we are a car manufacturer

03:56.120 --> 03:59.120
and we have several models and we create divisions by models,

03:59.120 --> 04:01.120
or by brands, we have several brands

04:01.120 --> 04:03.120
and each brand works as a division.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.120
Surely you understand the concept.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.120
In addition, you have to take into account

04:07.120 --> 04:09.120
that each division is almost like a small company,

04:09.120 --> 04:12.120
because it has its objectives, its budget, etc.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.120
The advantage of this, of the division

04:15.120 --> 04:19.120
regarding the functions, is that you are structuring the company

04:19.120 --> 04:23.120
in a way that is more aligned with the company's objectives.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.120
You are not creating those threads

04:25.120 --> 04:27.120
that people think only about their function,

04:27.120 --> 04:29.120
their tasks, but lose perspective.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.120
The company is more aligned with the objectives.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.120
This is the great advantage of divisions.

04:36.120 --> 04:41.120
The disadvantage is that inefficiencies can be generated.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.120
I will explain it with an example.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.120
We have divisions by countries.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.120
By countries in Europe, imagine.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.120
We have Spain, we have France, we have Italy, we have the UK.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.120
Each one works as a small company

04:53.120 --> 04:56.120
that has its objectives, its resources, its budgets, etc.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.120
And its functional departments are also within each division.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.120
Well, we have marketing in each of the countries.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.120
We have X marketing employees.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.120
They also work in an autonomous way.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.120
Those from Spain have nothing to do with those from the UK.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.120
Well, here are being generated first, some duplicities in costs.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.120
Because you can have people who are duplicated.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.120
But it is not only a matter of duplicity in costs,

05:22.120 --> 05:26.120
it is a matter of not generating a joint learning.

05:26.120 --> 05:30.120
Imagine that a very powerful initiative is launched in Spain

05:30.120 --> 05:32.120
that improves the customer experience.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.120
But it is being worked for Spain,

05:34.120 --> 05:37.120
it is not being worked for all of Europe.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.120
And it is very likely that later extrapolating those initiatives

05:41.120 --> 05:44.120
to other countries, well, it takes a long time,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.120
you have to overcome many barriers, etc.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.120
We have already seen how we can organize ourselves by functions and divisions.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.120
Well, matrices, matrix organizations,

05:55.120 --> 05:57.120
what they do is a mix of the two.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.120
A matrix has two dimensions.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.120
We are going to structure ourselves by functions and divisions.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.120
And each person is going to have two bosses.

06:06.120 --> 06:11.120
He is going to report to his superior or his functional boss.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.120
Imagine that you work in the marketing department,

06:13.120 --> 06:18.120
you report to the CMO, but you also have a boss who can be,

06:18.120 --> 06:21.120
well, imagine, the CEO in a certain country.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.120
Or the person in charge of a product.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.120
What are the benefits of this?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.120
Well, basically what we are trying to do is to combine the advantages

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
of the two types of organizations.

06:33.120 --> 06:38.120
We are going to make the organization be oriented to the results of the company

06:38.120 --> 06:41.120
because we are structuring ourselves based on products

06:41.120 --> 06:44.120
or business lines or countries, etc.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.120
But we generate certain synergies because we have the functions that are across

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
and what they do is provide service to everyone.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.120
And I'm going to give you an example.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.120
Remember that we talked about having divisions in each country.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.120
We take the marketing department and centralize it.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.120
And we have a marketing department for all of Europe

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
that provides service to all divisions, to the different countries.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.120
Well, it's easy to understand that many synergies are going to be generated like this,

07:14.120 --> 07:16.120
that we are going to avoid duplicities.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.120
Maybe we need fewer resources and we can also put them to work

07:20.120 --> 07:24.120
in initiatives or in providing support to all divisions,

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
so the impact is going to be much greater.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.120
One of the disadvantages of the matrix can be that the power line is unclear.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.120
It's easier when you know you report to a single boss

07:35.120 --> 07:37.120
than when you report to two bosses.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.120
And certain tensions can be generated there in some cases.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.120
But what is clear is that almost all the big organizations

07:45.120 --> 07:50.120
have tended in recent years to structure themselves through matrices.

07:50.120 --> 07:55.120
Therefore, it is obvious that the benefits are greater than the disadvantages.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.120
And finally, we are going to talk about the organization by projects,

07:59.120 --> 08:02.120
which is a very clear and unstoppable trend,

08:02.120 --> 08:05.120
which allows us to be more adaptive, to be more agile,

08:05.120 --> 08:09.120
it allows us to launch many projects, to be more flexible.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.120
So what is this about?

08:11.120 --> 08:17.120
Regardless of your structure, whether it is functional, matrix, divisional, I don't care,

08:17.120 --> 08:21.120
what you do is create projects, which are temporary organizations

08:21.120 --> 08:24.120
formed by people who can be in different departments,

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
even in different countries,

08:25.120 --> 08:28.120
that you put them to work with a common mission,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.120
with a common and temporary goal.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.120
One of the advantages of organizing yourself by projects,

08:34.120 --> 08:38.120
in addition to being more agile, is that you encourage the motivation of employees,

08:38.120 --> 08:42.120
because it is more motivating to work with a specific mission

08:42.120 --> 08:45.120
during a specific period of time and know that you are going to contribute to that,

08:45.120 --> 08:48.120
and that it also has a huge impact on the organization,

08:48.120 --> 08:52.120
than to spend your whole life going to your workplace and having your tasks

08:52.120 --> 08:55.120
and not knowing very well what the impact of what you are doing is.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.120
It is very clear that people work more motivated like this,

08:59.120 --> 09:02.120
with temporary missions and by projects.
