WEBVTT

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.000
We will identify and analyze

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.280
what are the growth levers,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.360
that is, what are the pathways

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.380
that the entire company

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.760
has to grow.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.240
I think it's very interesting because

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.820
the first thing you have to have

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.600
it in mind.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.360
When you have all the levers in

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.140
mind, it's easier to remember

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.780
and put them into practice

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.760
than to implant them in your business.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.980
What we're going to do is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.080
identify which metrics

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.100
are most important to make

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.560
a sediment or more representative

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.580
of that growth lever.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.700
I like to classify the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.320
growth levers into two blocks.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.500
I like to classify them into

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.040
new customers, we can grow by

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.640
capturing new customers, which

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.900
obviously will generate an additional

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.400
income, or what we can

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.020
do is grow in current customers,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.840
sell more to current

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.080
customers, buy us more

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.320
often, etc.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.220
Let's start with new customers.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.880
There are two ways or two of

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.520
unpaid new customer acquisition

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.460
leverage, which are organic,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.600
and therefore have a huge benefit

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100
because it reduces the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.760
average customer acquisition

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.620
cost.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.860
It is very easy to understand.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.060
And they are mouth-to-mouth, or

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.040
badly called because they really

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.380
should be called mouth-to-ear, and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.600
virality, which are different,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.920
although they are often confused.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.040
Mouth-to-mouth occurs when a customer

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.980
of yours is delighted and what

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.580
he does is tell his friends,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.680
family, etc., and is helping

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.920
you to capture customers at

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.780
zero cost.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.280
What is the key for this to happen?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.140
As we have said, the customer

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.200
is pleased, the customer experience

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.680
has exceeded their expectations.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.640


00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.560
How can we measure it?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.060
There are two important metrics.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.080
One is the NPS, which is a Net Promoter

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.280
Score survey, in which you are asked

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.400
from zero to ten, to what extent

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.680
would you recommend this product

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.340
to your friends or family?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.260
You probably did some

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.400
similar survey because

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.620
we at The Power Envoy

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.080
do it repeatedly.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980
Another very important and easier

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.680
ratio to measure is of all the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.040
customers I have, how many have

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.020
come by reference of friends?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.940
Because these have not cost me, I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.140
didn't have to invest in them.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.860
This is the mouth to mouth, let's

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.760
see the virality.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.800
Virality does not occur because

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.380
customers are delighted, virality

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.040
occurs due to the use of the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.720
product.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.320
You can see this with a good example,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.380
Dropbox.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.060
You can use Dropbox yourself only because

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.260
it's true that it brings value to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.760
you, because you can save your files

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.100
in the cloud and not have them in

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.980
the ornament, etc.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.580
But sharing is also very important,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.960
and when you send an invitation

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.700
to someone else to share

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.000
a folder with someone else

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.180
on Dropbox, you're

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.960
fostering Dropbox

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.720
virality.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.580
Dropbox has grown so.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.080
If you are not a client,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.340
you don't have Dropbox installed,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.640
you install it.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.520
You have a client for Dropbox.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.640
The metric with which we measure

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.760
virality is the virality coefficient.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.220
We will study it in more detail.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.560
But the virality coefficient tells

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.880
you about each of your clients

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.580
how many they have generated.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.500
If the virality coefficient is greater

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.460
than one, each client generates

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.800
more than one client, so the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.580
curve is exponential.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.900
What must we do so that

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.660
this happens?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.940
What we have to do is, we have

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.300
to do everything possible to make

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.020
it happen.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.300
We have to adapt the product, we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.820
have to design the product of the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.680
services, do engineering so that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.380
they are as viral as possible.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.560
And finally, how can we get new

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.040
customers?

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.200
Well, the traditional way, through

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.140
paid advertising, that is,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.720
investing to capture them.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.400
And here the most important

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.600
metrics, in order to be sustainable,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.700
is to subtract the cost of the Customer

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.200
Lifetime Value minus the cost

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.320
of customer acquisition.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.260
You know, this is a very important formula.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.980
And what we have to do is optimize

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.440
it, optimize one and optimize

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.940
another, and maximize the Customer

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.240
Lifetime Value and permanently

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.940
optimize the cost of customer

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.820
acquisition.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.300
As we do, we will be more profitable

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.180
and we will be able

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.220
to grow more.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.740
Let's see how to grow in current

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.080
customers.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.920
I would mostly say that there

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.520
are two leverages to grow in current

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.460
customers.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.520
One, that customers buy us more

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.500
often or for longer, that is

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.140
something similar.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.440
And the other, that each time they

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.700
buy us, they buy us more.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.480
Let us start with the lever

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.520
related to time, with the repetition.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.860
I have classified it in two, I have

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.800
classified it in repeat and lifetime.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.200
And I will explain why.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.540
There are where you sell

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.700
on time.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.440
Hawkers sell glasses.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.500
Well, here, for Hawkers to grow,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.780
what you have to is that the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.420
glasses buyers buy you

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.360
more often.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.700
What should we measure?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.700
That is the repetition rate.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.860
How many times, for example,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.360
a customer buys glasses in a period

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.660
of time throughout their

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.060
life?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.180
It would probably be the most representative

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.460
metric.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.160
What is what we have to do?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.280
The customer is delighted.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.080
Experience of the client.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.240
But I also put, as you can

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.700
see, I put lifetime.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.220
It could be a recurrence.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.360
I separated why.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.660
I am thinking about subscription

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.940
business models.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.240
Not in business models of punctual

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.220
purchase, but in business

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.320
models where there is a subscription

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.140
fee.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.720
And in this case what we measure

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.220
is not the number of times we buy.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.160
We could measure the time period

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.000
that is with us.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.980
Or we could measure the chan rate,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.640
which is the percentage of customers

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.600
who give us a drop.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.560
This is a metric that you need to know well.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.420
Because it is a very important

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.160
metric that you need to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.380
be constantly monitoring.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.440
Because as it is fired, as the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.200
rate rises, we have to analyze

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.380
and identify why.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.140
What depends all this on?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.340
Again, it depends on the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.960
customer experience.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.880
It depends on your customers being happy.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.520
If they are not happy, they are down.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.120
Now, we go to the last of the slides.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.140
How can we grow with our current

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.700
customers?

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.960
Every time they buy us, they

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.960
buy us more.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.580
There are several strategies to do so.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320
Cross, Upsell and attach.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.280
Cross selling and top selling.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.480
The main thing is that

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.960
the average ticket is higher.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.540
And how do we do it?

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.280
through product development.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.360
If you sell him a headband and sell

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.220
him a glasses, you have achieved

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.100
that the average ticket is higher.
