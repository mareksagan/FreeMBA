00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.530
One of the key aspects of Lean Startup

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.670
is knowing how to measure, it is knowing

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.210
how to identify the metrics that allow

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.950
us to advance in this process.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.310
As you know, we have to start

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.330
by identifying the hypotheses

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.210
of our business model and what

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.110
we have to do is validate them,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.030
and we validate them through

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.130
experiments, through the minimum

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.650
viable product, etc.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.250
How do we know if we are on the right

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.910
track or not?

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.030
Well, we know it mainly

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.230
using metric, because

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.970
it will be more objective.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.390
And from those results what

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.390
we will do will be to pivot

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.350
or continue on the path we were on.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.350
It is very important to know

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.870
what type of metric to use.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.250
Lean Startup proposes that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.450
we use metrics that are different

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.690
from the metrics that are

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.290
usually used to manage

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.310
any business.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.550
And in fact he warns us not

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.810
to use what he considers Vanity

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.110
Metrics, vanidious metrics.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.290
Instead, we must use metrics

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.730
that are useful, which allow

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.370
us to make decisions based on

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.690
those metrics.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.030
Let's first look at what Eric Rice

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.890
is talking about when he talks about

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.610
Vanity Metrics.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.170
We are talking about metrics

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.810
that help us draw a curve in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.450
this way.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.490
If you only fix on sales or you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.270
fix on metrics like the number

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.130
of downloads or likes you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.550
have had on social networks,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.290
it may be that if you have a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.350
certain attraction you can draw,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.410
you can pick up the metrics

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.550
of your business and draw a

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.830
graphic in this way.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.490
And what does this mean?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.250
This means you are on the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.510
right path, it doesn't have to

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.130
be so.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.550
And most importantly, these metrics

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.590
we were talking about,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.590
the number of users, the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.710
number of visits, sales, etc.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.850
Most importantly, do you have the ability

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.170
to make decisions?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.510
Do you know if you are on the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.410
right track or not?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.410
Do they allow you to learn?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.430
No is no.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.150
I will explain a few examples.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.990
We are improving our product.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.870
We are improving our product and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.390
we are improving our website, we

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.330
are testing different channels,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.050
we are testing many things

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.050
at once.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.690
And it turns out that sales are growing.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.070
Well, what is the cause of that?

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.270
How do we establish a cause-affection relationship?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.970
How do we learn?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.790
How do we know which experiments

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.890
are going well and which

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.490
are not?

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.150
How do we know which way

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.970
we should go?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.030
It is very complicated.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.630
And it's also that, look,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.890
sales may be kicking up simply

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.910
because you're investing

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.290
more in marketing.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.210
Invest more in marketing, sales

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.130
grow, it seems you are on the right

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.210
track but it doesn't have to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.550
be so.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.230
Because you may be looking at customers

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.070
who are really not satisfied if

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.290
they don't buy again and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.770
you have a business that is not

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.010
sustainable.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.470
Or it turns out that you're investing

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.210
a lot of money in having thousands

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.370
of followers on social media.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.110
This fact does not give you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.550
much information.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.910
Or you're investing a lot of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.310
money in capturing new customers

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.990
in a recurrence or subscription business.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.830
Well, it's true that the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.690
number of customers can

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.690
be growing and that can

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.170
make their sales grow

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.170
on time.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.670
However, it's because you're

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.910
investing more, it's not because

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.670
you're improving, it's

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.770
because you're learning.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.810
Well, as we see, Eric Rice warns

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.130
us that, eye, with the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.050
metrics we use we do not

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.970
use vanidious metrics.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.390
These metrics are also often

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.890
used to convince investors,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.850
to convince yourself that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.990
you are on the right track.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.270
In any case, it is an error.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.910
And what it tells us is that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.470
the only metrics we have to use,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.670
in which we have to put absolute

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.130
focus, those are the metrics

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.350
that allow us to make decisions,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.970
the metrics that allow

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.730
us to learn.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.510
Basically, they are the metrics that

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.350
allow us to move forward in the cycle.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.990
What kind of metric are they?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.150
They are mainly metrics

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.570
that are more related to

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.970
customer behavior.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.550
Let's take an example, the churn

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.330
rate.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.670
The churn rate is the percentage

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.410
of your customers

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.090
who drop each year.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.710
Well, if you do what you do is systematically

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.550
measure the evolution of the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.270
churn rate, because this generates

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.630
a very valuable information, because

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.150
if the churn rate is increasing,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.770
if you are given more customers down,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.910
well, because you will have

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.790
an indicator, an alarm that something

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.210
is not going well, that you

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.990
are not on the right path or

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.270
maybe that there is a competitor

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.050
who is doing things better

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.630
than you.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.850
Or, for example, you can measure

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.010
metrics related to conversions.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.010
How many people visit my website?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.170
And what percentage of those customers

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.850
become customers?

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.490
How many of these customers recommend

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.310
us to others?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.430
Repeat things, etc.? to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.130
These conversion-related metrics

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.550
are much more representative

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.810
of customer behavior, since

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.290
you're doing something that

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.770
customers like and also

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.310
allows you to isolate

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.890
experiments.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.130
That is, we are making an improvement

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.730
on our website, as what we have

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.450
to do is measure whether conversions

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.590
within the website are

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.970
improving.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.250
Or, if we make an improvement

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.610
to our product, what we have

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.050
to measure is whether

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.530
related ratios, recurrence-

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.170
related metrics, for example,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.750
or with which our customers

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.950
are recommending us to others

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.630
are improving.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.610
We set a foundation and what we

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.770
do is go constantly analyzing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.070
how those metrics, which

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.130
are the most important

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.190
in your business, are improving.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.990
But don't look, really, don't

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.050
look at sales, don't fall into

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.950
everyone's mistake.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.450
Don't be obsessed with

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.810
sales, absolute values of customer

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.830
numbers, number of visits,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.710
etc.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.050
One day it will play you.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.690
There will be a time when you have

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.810
absolutely validated your business

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.650
model and what you have to do

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.890
is grow as much as possible in sales.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.070
But until you validate it,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.250
when what you touch is learning,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.230
what you have to do is forget

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.490
those metrics and use metrics

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.930
that allow you to learn, being

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.390
redundant, that allow you

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.250
to make decisions, that allow

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.570
you to know if you are on

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.950
the right path or not.
