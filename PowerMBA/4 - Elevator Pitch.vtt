WEBVTT

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.550
We must be able to communicate

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.630
in a very attractive, direct, concise

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650
way that will generate interest

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.410
in our project in many different

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.330
circumstances.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.710
You have already learned how to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.090
prepare the pitch deck, the presentation,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.210
and knowing the structure

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.570
of the presentation is helping

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.210
you to better structure the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.210
ideas in your head.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.430
But we also have to create a more

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.410
synthesized version, which is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.070
what we call the elevator pitch.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.230
The elevator pitch is used

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.470
on different occasions.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.390
You will use it permanently, in

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.030
a personal way, every day.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.750
So someone new comes to the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.890
office, you meet a supplier, you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.830
talk to a customer, you know

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.150
someone or you have a job interview

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.130
with someone you want to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.970
file, you know a potential

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.970
investor, on a dinner you present

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.110
someone new and ask what

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.830
you do, in thousands of

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.190
occasions.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.010
You have to have the ideas very

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.170
well structured in your head to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550
be able to transmit in 30 seconds

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.370
what you do, to whom, what

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.250
you contribute, etc.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.090
The elevator pitch

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.430
will be used in writing.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.970
You will find yourself writing a

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.190
lot of emails in which you

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.310
have to explain to someone who has

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.730
no reason to know your company

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.150
what you do.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.230
We receive many requests from

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.230
many projects and the difference between,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.850
no matter how you get a paragraph, the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.990
difference between that that paragraph

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.550
is well explained, that you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.930
understand quickly what the project consists

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.250
of, that you do not understand it,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.230
is vital, is between generating interest

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.870
and not generating it.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.030
So we have to work on this.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.070
I'll give you a tip before you get

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.810
into the script and it's that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.670
you use a language as simple

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.110
as possible.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.070
I'm thinking of many of the elevator

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.390
pitch that have made us come

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.270
and actually use very technical,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.890
very sophisticated

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.130
words, etc.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.690
In the end, you don't understand anything.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.690
I think we all think that when we read

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.450
something or when someone speaks

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.650
to us in a language we don't

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.530
understand, that generates rejection.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.770
Therefore, do not use words,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.530
do not use technicisms, do not

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.910
give for granted that your

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.270
interlocutor understands if

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.210
you are talking about

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.470
technology you know.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.190
All that generates rejection, you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.030
have to speak very clearly and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.130
very naturally, as if you tell your

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.970
mother, your father or a friend.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.310
Don't sophisticate things because you don't

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.550
earn anything by doing it.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.990
Another advice I'm going to give

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.610
you is to practice it because in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.450
many cases entrepreneurs don't

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.190
practice elevator pitch and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.290
think it will come out

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.070
naturally.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.110
But I'm sure that if we do the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.690
test and put them in front of them

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.290
in different circumstances, they

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.390
tell it in one way.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.990
This can't be, it doesn't take much

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.670
effort but it's convenient that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.250
we prepare our elevator pitch

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.470
structure and practice it.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.870
How is the elevator pitch

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.490
created?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.070
You already know the structure

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.090
or script of the main sections that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.850
the pitch deck has to have or

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.250
that the pitch has to have.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.670
We need to make a synthesis.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.250
Remember that the main sections

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.630
are problems, solution, opportunity,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.310
market size, equipment,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.950
business model,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.630
etc.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.880
You will have the opportunity to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.760
include more or less information depending

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.400
on the interlocutor, depending

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.520
on the situation you are

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.200
in, etc.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.980
There is really no single scheme,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.420
but what you have to do

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.700
is work it first.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.720
And what I'm going to do is share

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.740
with you and you can download a series

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.440
of templates, of structures that

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.260
you can use that will help you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
create your own.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.520
You can also pick up parts of

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.020
one template and parts of another.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.520
Depending on how you want to communicate.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.020
But basically what we need to

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.760
do is, of all the pitch sections,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.460
what we have to do is identify

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.640
the most important ones.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.840
The most important is the problem

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.920
and the solution.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.420
That is, what problem exists,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.600
who has that problem and what is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.480
our solution and what benefit

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.720
we will generate.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.020
To create Elevator Pitch, what

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.100
we have to do is a synthesized

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.400
version of the pitch.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.080
What happens is that it helps a lot

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.560
to have templates or models on which

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.160
to start.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.580
And that's why what we've done is

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.200
that we've shared a few with you.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.020
You can choose the one you like

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.820
most or you can adapt one.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.700
This is the simplest of all.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.640
Problems, solutions and benefits.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.600
I would like to give you the example of PowerMJ.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.080
There are millions of people in

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.900
the world who would like to have

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.580
more knowledge about business,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.500
strategy, etc.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.440
That is why we have created a very efficient

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.660
and very affordable program.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.390
It helps our students grow

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.390
professionally.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.550
As you can see, it is a problem, a solution and a benefit.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.670
I have left you many more or several more.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.270
Your company name, the product

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.690
description, for whom, what

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.130
problem it solves and what

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.430
is the benefit.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.410
Or one very similar, but that instead

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.710
of ending the profit what you end

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.950
up with is your competitive

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.830
advantage or your differential factor.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.270
There are some longer.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.730
I am, COD, what we offer, for whom,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.150
what allows them, with what benefit.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.350
And here what we do

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.590
is, unlike who our competitors

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.710
are, we offer, etc.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.450
As you can see, it is a matter of adapting.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.420
As the elevator pitch you will

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.280
use in different circumstances,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.520
in some cases you will have

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.760
more time, what you can also

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.220
do is incorporate more information

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.920
in the event that you can

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.580
do so.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.940
Information about the opportunity

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.780
or who the team is made up of,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.220
what your vision is, or the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.960
milestones or what you have demonstrated.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.670
I leave you also a longer one, in this

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.090
case it is in English, which would

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.690
be almost like the complete one in which

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.150
you are incorporating almost all the

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.290
information from the pitch.
