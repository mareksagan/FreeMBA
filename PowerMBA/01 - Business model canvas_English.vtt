WEBVTT

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.560
We will start with the first class

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.120
in which we will learn to use the

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.760
business model canvas, the tool

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.220
I have talked about, which

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.660
in Spanish, translated into Spanish,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.840
is a canvas of business models.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.240
We will usually give it canvas,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.640
from now on we will use

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.760
this term.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.640
I like to describe canvas as

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.840
a tool that allows us to

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.120
understand the mechanism, right?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.300
How to fit the parts in a business

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.340
model.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.300
The structure of the Business Model

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.300
is composed of nine blocks, which

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.460
are the nine main blocks of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.400
a business model.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.300
Then, what we do is fill

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.360
each of the blocks and in that

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.820
way we draw a business

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.300
model.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.780
I want you to be aware that canvas

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.940
not only allows us to draw

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.860
or describe a business model,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.080
but that what we will do

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.020
is, from that description,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.740
we analyze it.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.820
And once we’ve got certain

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.200
ideas, we’ll use an evolution

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.060
or innovation, the generation

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.340
of a new business model,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.840
right?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.180
Today, what we’re going to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.400
do is draw a business model,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.920
learn to describe it.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.660
And when we talk about drawing,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.520
we use this concept because the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.660
canvas is usually drawn, it is

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.960
used as a canvas on which

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.380
you paint.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.980
Well, today we will see, I will explain

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.320
it from the case of Mango, the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.140
Spanish clothing manufacturer

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.720
and retailer that has

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.160
expanded internationally.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.400
Why did I use this example?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.020
Well, because I think it’

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.140
s a company that we all

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.480
quickly get a little idea of,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.940
right?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.760
Well let us start.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.220
We start with the nine blocks of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.540
the business model.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.760
Every business model should

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.460
always start from the knowledge

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.800
of who our customers are and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.240
we have the first block called

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.820
customer segments.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.720
In this case, what we will

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.700
identify is who we are targeting,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.560
which customer segments

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.700
we are creating value.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.360
There is no point in making a

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.100
micro-segmentation of ages,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
sexes, geography and so on.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.660
It is really a high-level analysis,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.420
that is, what are the different

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.960
customer segments to which

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.540
we really offer tailored

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.060
value proposals or address

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.400
through different channels,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.520
right?

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.480
I don’t know if you understand the difference.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.880
Really, to consider it a separate

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.180
customer segment, the criterion

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.720
is that, we offer it, that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.300
it is a group to which we offer

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.940
something different to others.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.200
And I think in a company like Mango,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.620
in principle, we have men,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.340
women and children.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.800
If you think about it inside the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.180
points of sale, there are spaces

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.640
adapted for each of them.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.580
The products that are created

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.180
for each segment are different, etc.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.120
I think that would be the main segmentation.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480
Once we already know who we are addressing,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.200
we already know who we are addressing,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.340
the next thing is to analyze

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.720
what we offer them and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.700
we have the block called

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700
product and service offer.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.680
Some people give you a value proposal.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.480
But the question is what?

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.280
What do we offer?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.700
Is it worth?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.200
In the case of Mango,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.240
what Mango offers is mainly

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.220
clothing.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.680
We could say that it is clothes for

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.980
men, for women and for children.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.380
We could differentiate.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.520
And we could add some value, such

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.520
as design clothes at affordable

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.780
prices, for example.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.620
But well, I think it’s easy

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.500
to grasp what it is, what’s going

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.380
inside proposed products and services.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.060
The following.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.340
We know who we are, we know

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.780
what we offer.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.360
The next is the distribution channel.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.600
How did we get to them?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.300
What are the means we

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.840
use so that customers know

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.000
us, convince them, buy us,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.500
buy us, provide them

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.480
with after-sales service, etc.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.340
And in the case of Mango,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.080
mainly, are the points of sale to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.980
the stores and, in addition, the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.640
website.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.660
We could do a bit more analytical

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.020
and identify that Mango has a direct

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.860
channel, that they are point

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.520
of sale or indirect channel, that they

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.100
would be franchises, right?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.720
The next block is the relationship

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.240
with customers.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.740
That is, I think it’s the hardest block

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.120
to understand and there are people

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.800
who use it in a different way.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.040
But basically what you need to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.980
do is explain or describe how

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.080
our relationships with

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.360
customers are.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.580
That they are personal or are produced

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.880
through, or are digital, are

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.900
close or not.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.660
Well, it’s a matter of explaining it, right?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.740
It is something that is really valuable.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.600
Because customer relationships

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.180
are determinants of many

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.240
things in a business model.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.360
In the case of Mango, we could

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.820
say that the main relationship occurs

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.560
at the point of sale with the sellers,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.740
but then there are more touch

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.300
points.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.900
For example, clothes, once you have

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.400
bought them, you have some interaction

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.280
with the permanent brand

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.560
and, well, then the brand,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.000
I think you can establish

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120
in some case, in the case of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.300
fashion, for example, certain

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.100
relations of loyalty.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.040
Well, we already know who we sell

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.140
it to, we already know what we

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.480
sell it to, we already know how we will

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.120
get to them.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.240
But all this has a goal and is to

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.300
generate income.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.040
And we have the revenue flow

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.980
block in which we will

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.980
describe how those revenue flows are.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.600
Not if we earn a lot of money or a little

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.220
money, but in what format.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.280
We will see it in detail in one of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.780
the classes.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.280
For it can be by selling products,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.460
it can be by selling services,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.940
it can be by recurring services

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.200
in subscription, it can be rentals,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.360
it can be licenses,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
right?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.720
In the case of mango, it is very simple.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.860
The model is very simple.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.540
They just sell clothes.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.960
If we think, for example,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.920
of Amazon, imagine the different

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.300
revenue flows it has.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.940
Intermediacy in products on the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.500
marketplace or sale of products

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.700
in e-commerce or subscription

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.780
quotas, etc.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.780
Now, we go to the left

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.100
block.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.240
In the block on the left, what

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.980
we’re going to identify is what

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.120
we need to offer that value

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.400
proposal to those customers.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.640
We need resources, we

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.660
need key activities, we

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.760
need to establish alliances,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.660
right?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.120
It is a different concept.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.580
And we will start with the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.500
resources, which is something

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.900
very important that we will also

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.780
analyze in detail in this course

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.480
of business models.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.260
The resources we have to

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.940
answer the following question.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.460
What are the assets, whether

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.300
material, intangible, human,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.420
intellectual, that we need for

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.840
this business model to work?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.520
In the case of Mango,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.200
it primarily needs to have a large

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.540
capillary of points of sale, it

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.100
needs to have a very powerful

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.000
brand and also needs to have

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.640
a lot of stock within those points

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.780
of sale.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.140
The stock is to imagine

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.380
the financial resources you also

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.860
have to have to have permanently

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.600
funded a stock that is

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.260
worth hundreds of millions

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
at all points of sale.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.060
In order to offer that value proposition,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.980
in addition to resources, we

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.300
need to be good at some things

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.520
or we need to focus on certain

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.560
key activities.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.240
There are business models that

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.440
require you to be very good, because in

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.660
I plus D or that you are very

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.200
efficient or that you are very good in

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.220
the relationship with customers.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.340
Well, it depends on the business

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.360
model, but it’s very good to do this

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.360
analysis.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.520
In the case of Mango, I think

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.940
that Mango has to focus on

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.560
all the parts of purchases,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.800
the management of suppliers,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.580
etc., with suppliers

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.660
all over the world.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.900
It has to focus on the design, to always

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.700
have permanent collections that are

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.660
attractive, it is another of

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.780
the key activities and also

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.960
the management of the distribution

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.400
channel, of that distribution channel

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.620
we have talked about, because it

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.860
is something that requires a

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.320
lot of attention and a lot

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.960
of focus.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.420
It is something vital.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.240
Now let’s go to the alliances.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.960
Any business model to be able to

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.480
offer that value proposal, as we

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.540
said, to those customers, in

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.200
addition to resources and key activities,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.660
is convenient that it is supported

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.440
by third companies with which

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.080
it develops relationships more

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.540
or less stable, but that help

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.280
it to offer everything else,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.800
right?

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.460
Usually here the main

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.960
suppliers are usually incorporated

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.280
into this analysis.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.860
These are third companies that are

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.040
really important in the business

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.600
model.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.300
I in the case of Mango would say that,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.960
in addition to the suppliers, I could

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.560
incorporate the franchisees, who

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.900
are entrepreneurs who are part

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.400
of the distribution channel, but

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.500
who are true alliances, true,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.600
yes, true alliances, strategic

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.660
alliances because they are

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.240
very important for Mango.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.800
Well, and from all this, those

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.520
resources, those activities,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.680
etc., will generate costs for

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.740
us and we must be able to identify

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.840
what the main costs are,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.300
describe them as they

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.360
are.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.980
They are fixed, they are variable,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.180
they are produced, they

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.240
are produced mainly due to

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.200
wages or the purchase of assets, etc.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.160
We have to do an analysis without

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.640
much detail and at a high level, that

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.980
that in the end are the analyses that

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.960
allow us to identify or draw more

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.480
valuable conclusions, right?

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.260
In the case of a company like

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.560
Mango, I think that the variable

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.040
cost for all the goods sold is

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.940
very important and the fixed

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.780
cost of structure you have,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.760
then, at the points of sale

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.180
and also all the staff.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.600
It would be the two

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.840
main games, right?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.340
Well, since we’ve already seen

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.340
the nine Business Model Canvas

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.900
blocks, we’ve seen how they fit

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.960
and what you have to do is

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.860
get familiar with this.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.140
It’s likely today, that we’ve seen

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.760
them all very quickly, as you

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.260
haven’t been able to remember

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.040
them all, but don’t worry because

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.600
we’re going to use this tool to

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.340
analyze many cases in the

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.820
coming days, the coming weeks.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.840
Then you will be gradually assimilating

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.140
it, but I hope to have transmitted

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.180
the value of being able to

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.740
draw in such a simple

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.860
way and have intuitive

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.380
any business model.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.620
One of the things I love and

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.060
will see is that when we

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.500
analyze success cases, when

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.060
we analyze innovations,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.260
etc., at the end always.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.840
You can draw on the canvas,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.200
you can always explain it in this

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.440
way, always the pieces fit, right?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.100
I think that’s one of the

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.120
key reasons why this

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.220
tool has been so successful.
