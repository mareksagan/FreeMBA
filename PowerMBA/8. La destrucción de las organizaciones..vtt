00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.330
In today's class I'll share a series

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.450
of conclusions that start

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.950
from our professional experience,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.030
in this case as strategy

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.970
consultants and working

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.630
with large corporations.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.650
And I'll start with a very drastic

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.070
statement and it's that around

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.550
40% of organizations are pure

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.790
fat.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.770
It's like if you have fat on the tripa,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.010
it doesn't serve you for anything,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.730
in addition to getting bad, making

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.650
you heavier, etc.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.550
It is not worth nothing, it is worth nothing.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370
By the way, this is more dramatic in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430
more hierarchical and more functional

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.510
organizations.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.390
The most modern, more democratic,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.390
more horizontal, more flat, more

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.230
client-centered organizations,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.950
this percentage may go from

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.430
40 to 10%.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.650
But I want you to stay with

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.670
the idea, right?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.090
You may be part of the organization,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.410
but it's not your

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.350
fault.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.890
In fact, you are the main damned,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.290
because being part of the fat

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.890
is very dismotivating.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.930
What I'm going to do is, since I've

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.810
done, let's say, that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.990
this statement, let's make the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.430
diagnosis, I'm going to share

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.490
with you why I say it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.110
Let us highlight four factors.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.550
One, most people do a lot of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.310
things, a lot of tasks, sit

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.950
at their job and do things,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.030
but that are not aligned

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.350
with strategic goals,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.090
do not bring a direct value.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.090
That is number one.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.550
The number two, the more people there

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.010
are in an organization, the more

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.050
heavy the organizations become,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.790
the less agile they become.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.530
Three, the intermediate command,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.850
in many cases you may be an intermediate

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.770
command of your organization.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.970
The intermediate commands in

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.150
vertical organizations do what

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.270
they do is destroy value, because

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.650
they make the company less

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.830
customer-centric.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.610
And look, I share this photo

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.470
with you, which is from a book

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.290
by Tom Peters, from a book from the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.190
year 92, in which he illustrated

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.290
how decision making made decision

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.690
making away from the client with

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.810
very vertical and very

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.190
functional organizations.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.590
The more people there are in the middle,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.910
the harder it is for information

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.370
to come well and it is vital that those

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.130
who make decisions understand customers

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.190
very well.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.210
And finally, how many more people

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.910
we incorporate into the structure

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.890
of an organization and I'm sure you've

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.210
experienced this if you've seen

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.890
how a structure of few employees

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.690
grows to many, you're filing people

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.230
and you've got more needs

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.070
of all kinds, you have more support

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.590
needs for that people, you have

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.630
to go to larger offices,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.950
there's more bureaucracy,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.950
you need more people of accounting,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890
you need people of administration,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.790
you need people of human

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.910
resources to file them, etc.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.190
Well, these four factors are the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.470
main causes of what we have said

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.070
of the large percentage of fat

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.410
in organizations.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.150
By the way, we don't say what

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.370
we say about those resources,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.210
because if organizations

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.530
are structured better, you could

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.050
take more advantage of those

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.390
resources and they't be

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.690
fat, but they could turn them

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.650
into muscle.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.050
What happens is that with this type

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.090
of structure those resources not

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.390
only are not generating additional

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.330
costs, but the organization

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
becomes slower.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.690
And now we go with the solution, that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.070
the solution is also very radical and

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.410
can be assumed in this phrase and is

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.350
we will destroy the formal

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.430
organizations, we will dynamize them,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.810
it is not a matter of decentralizing

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.070
what does not usually work,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.370
of making more divisions,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.790
we will destroy it all,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.730
scrap and new account.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.970
And what we're going to do

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.250
is turn that great organization into

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.770
small mini-organisations, in

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.590
five councils.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.770
The first thing they have to be mini-

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.250
companies, that is, they have to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.150
be formed by very few people, they have

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.130
to be very manageable organizations

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.090
and you will understand it well.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.930
What do you think can motivate more?

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.070
What types of organizations are

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.190
you most aligned with with

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.750
strategic goals?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.170
You want to innovate, etc.? to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.250
If you work in one or it's easier to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.230
organize, among 1,235 people, for example,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.290
imagine what it's like to make decisions

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.010
among 1,235 people, however

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.150
much they are hierarchized

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.370
or between 16.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.810
Well, because the answer is very clear.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.710
Small organizations

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.530
work much better by duty

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.630
than large organizations.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.430
Richard Branson, a visionary,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.750
says that when people start

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.410
to not know the people who

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.030
work in the building, he

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.890
is sure that if you work

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.270
in a big company you get, you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.150
ride the elevator and you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.550
don't know who your colleagues

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.270
are.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.770
Well, because at that moment the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.090
company begins to become impersonal

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.550
and what it says is that it

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.770
must be disintegrated, it

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.210
must be destroyed, as we said.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.150
In his case he says the limit

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.730
should be around 50 or 60

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.490
people.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.530
That is, every 50 or 60 people

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.730
should work in different teams,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.030
in different companies.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.690
Well, we can do this in

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.390
two ways.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.770
That is, we have to create mini-

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.130
businesses, but we have

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.510
to assign them tasks,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.510
functions, goals.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.470
What to do there are two options.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.090
One, if your business, your environment

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.150
is stable, what you can assign them

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.870
are more stable functions, right?

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.850
They are like mini-businesses,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.990
small business units that have

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.830
their goals, etc.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.490
If, on the other hand, you are in a

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.890
more innovative, more dynamic environment,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.170
what you can do is, in addition

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.350
to those business units,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.910
organize yourself by projects, which

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.430
is basically the same, what we have

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.190
seen is a trend, that the large

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.130
matrix organizations are

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.110
increasingly creating more

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.790
internal projects.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.450
One of the key aspects, and if

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.890
not, it won't work, is what's called

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.550
the concept of empowering.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.310
These mini-businesses really

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.010
have to be mini-businesses, that

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.050
is, they have to have absolute

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.790
autonomy, they have to have their

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.090
results, they have to have their

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.390
ability to make decisions,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.990
to invest, to buy this,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.110
the other, to travel, to do

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.950
what gives them the taste.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.330
You have to have talented people

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.730
who are able to make decisions, and

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.950
it is not that you have to delegate,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.990
it is that you have to empower

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.390
them, give them the tools so

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.670
that they can do it.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.410
What will we with

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.830
this?

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.390
Among other things, what we're going

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.710
to get, and it's something that's

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.210
really a very helpful advice,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.590
is that we have to get everyone

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.850
in the organization to feel

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.810
entrepreneurs.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.050
This may sound ambitious, but

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.230
it can be achieved.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.570
And what we get is that when

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.470
someone is responsible for their

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.890
successes and failures, they play

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.370
with sales, with the investments

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.890
they make, etc., they will think like

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.170
an entrepreneur, they will think

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.810
like you.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.390
What you get is that you are

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.710
much more motivated, you will

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.570
give 200% and also make you

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.390
happy of life.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.370
We put this in

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.150
practice.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.930
In many cases, with people from

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.690
the teams we assign you results accounts.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.990
We don't set a sales target.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.350
If you sell so much, we pay you a

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.850
bonus, no.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.090
We assign a result account to

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.030
you, as if you were a shareholder

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.290
of the equity, as if you were

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.110
a more partner.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.430
And you will participate in the profits.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.850
That is, we will make a result

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.510
account with the sales that

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.990
will be generated, costs, margins,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.450
your salary, etc.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.790
And he will take a percentage of

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.870
those profits, as if he were a partner

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.550
of the parent.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.270
And finally, as we have seen,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.310
we have created mini-businesses

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.110
and created a very flat structure.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.250
We will do it on two levels.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.250
What we propose is that it is

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.790
a horizontal structure with two

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.950
levels, the mini companies or

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.450
projects and a top layer, a small

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.410
upper layer that is the leadership,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.930
that what you have to do

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.310
is basically give support,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.890
provide resources, define

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.870
the strategic vision, hire

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.270
talent, etc.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.830
We will make a quick look

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.210
at the benefits we will.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.570
We will make the organization,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.170
the entire organization,

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.630
those mini-businesses

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.610
aligned with the strategic

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.770
goals.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.130
Because it is much more flat, it

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.310
is very close, we will get it to be

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.710
a much more agile organization,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.470
because instead of being 2000 people,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.510
in the end, the decisions are made

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.010
in very small teams and no longer

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.270
depend on, those teams are autonomous,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.850
no longer depend on what they

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.310
say about finance, the purchases

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.730
that put you in a trap, etc.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.470
No, decisions are made and executed

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.710
very quickly, as if they

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.050
were small startups.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.810
We're going to get people

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.550
much more motivated, because

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.190
when you feel a piece inside

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.970
a giant it's very dismotivating.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.510
Instead, when you feel part of

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.350
a small company and know what

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.030
your decisions impact, what

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.410
you do on a daily basis, etc.,

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.670
you are much happier at work

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.050
and give a lot more of yourself.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:41.370


00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.110
And finally, what we're going

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.490
to is an organization that is

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.550
much closer to the customer.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.910
Remember, that screen-up of the

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.550
book I've taught you, in which the

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.650
vertical structure does what it does

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.470
is to push away the decision-

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.490
making of the client.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.950
In this case it is a very flat structure

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.910
in which everyone, the entire

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.450
organization will be closer

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.590
to the customer.
