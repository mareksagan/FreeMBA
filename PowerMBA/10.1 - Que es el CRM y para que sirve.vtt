WEBVTT

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.070
Jaime, we already understand

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.670
what CRM is, what departments use

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.910
it and for what, but now I would

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.950
like to have more knowledge

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.090
of the tool itself.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.610
We can describe how it is used

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.530
or what the main functionalities are.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.690
We could possibly split it into

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.250
three large blocks, which is

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.350
true that then each platform is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890
different and can separate it from

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.450
the way let's say you sell licenses

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.350
is different, but in general

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.890
and what is common to all

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.870
is an analytical part.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.590
The moment you have a lot of data

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.430
in that system you are storing it

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.970
for a reason and it is for making

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.790
decisions based on all that information,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.950
that is, what is usually called

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.950
business intelligence

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.370
and even big data.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.110
All that information we will

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.690
analyze it and we will see what type

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.650
of customer we have, how we

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.030
can segment them, what kind of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.070
message we have to send to each

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.590
of which parts we are more fluffy.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.070
Analyze the company and the market.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.790
And the tool that has functionalities,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.270
I understand modules, whatever,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.250
that which allows us to make

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.390
filters, cross information, etc.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.290
The vast majority of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.530
tools always have a reporting

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.190
part and then you can always

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.310
make views on each of these

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.890
objects.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.910
Many times they are probably

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.590
not all the powerful we need and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.550
that is why it is important

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.510
to integrate that maybe with

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.810
powerful reporting tools that

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.650
allow you to make the advanced

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.570
filters you really need.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.250
One of the tips is analytics.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050
The second leg would be the entire

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.350
operational part, that is, how

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.290
we will automate processes to be

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.350
much more efficient, which would

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.470
be free of operational time

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.150
that we can use in other things

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.390
and that will help us not to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.590
have failures.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.970
In the trading area, we can

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.710
automatize the entire sales

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.770
process, that is, see a little

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.270
how customers move through the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.750
different stages of trading.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.090
We can also analyze what sales

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.190
forecasts are, all of this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.330
can be automated and in the marketing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.310
part is something similar.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.390
All the famous customer journey

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.830
can be automated, we can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.950
launch those emails or those

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.170
SMS or any type of notification

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.590
through all this type of tools.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.210
That is, they are tools that allow us,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.350
say, I don't know whether to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.310
design or create actions and program them.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.070
justly.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.730
Even what you do is that they take

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.570
action based on certain data.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.390
They can be historical data that you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.450
already have stored or we can put

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.690
a component that is very fashionable

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.530
now that it is artificial intelligence

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.710
and try to predict how the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.910
customer will behave.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.550
That is, if a customer has

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.090
entered our website, has been

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.410
visiting the price part, we

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.470
know if he is interested

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.830
in this, we can create a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.350
lead based on this visit.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.050
We, for example, currently use a direct

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.310
response marketing system and basically

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.630
what we do is deliver a series

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.210
of free classes and depending

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.490
on whether they have seen one,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.450
two or which, they receive different

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.850
emails in which we encourage

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.230
them to see them and we get

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.530
to empathize, get closer

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.430
to them.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.930
And here you have a clear example

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.990
of de-automatization, to see a little

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.130
how the customer is behaving,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.290
what type of profile he has and according

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.310
to that to give him a message

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.830
or another and see a little what

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.370
that interaction or that reaction

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.790
that the customer has we will

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750
have put in our CRM and we will

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.070
be able to make decisions based

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.710
on that, either automated

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.910
or at best you pick up the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.610
phone and call him.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.110
And the last part would be the collaborative

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.710
part, we have spoken before all

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.390
the departments that are part

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.150
of this great strategy,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.130
this great initiative, what is

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.810
important is that they do not

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.470
work in silos, but compact

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.810
information between them.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.010
If I as a marketing manager

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.770
have created a campaign, it is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.510
good for my marketing force to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.510
know that the campaign is live

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.650
and who the customers are

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.770
receiving it.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.050
And also the reverse, that is,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.730
if a trader is going to negotiate

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.230
a major contract, during that

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.910
period of time that customer

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.790
does not have to receive

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.830
any communication, no campaign

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.130
to avoid spoiling that

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.190
trading.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.410
Before it has come out an example

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.530
too, the previous class related

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.030
to this, with the functionality

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.970
of collaboration and we talked

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.490
about that customer care, marketing,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.650
sales, especially customer care

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.930
and sales, feed information that

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.130
allows us to know much better

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.050
the customer and other department

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.630
that in principle has no reason

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.770
to have a lot of relationship

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.770
with them, as it can be product

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.230
development, I don't know,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.810
and more...

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.830
Of course, if you have access, if

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.810
you have done well and you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.970
are actually using it collaboratively

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.610
and have access to all that

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.730
information, because you will

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.250
make the decisions about creating

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.270
new products that are fundamental

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.410
in real interactions

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.210
with customers, that not

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.410
doing it is a pointless thing.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.910
And if you want, I will give you another

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.890
example based a little on what

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.770
we were talking about before

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.790
the barrier of entry that has

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.430
the trade force.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.390
If the trade force is putting all

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.770
the business opportunities it has,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.330
we can come to predict if there

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.970
is some demand in certain months.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.910
That information can be obtained by

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.330
the manufacturing department,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.910
the manufacturing department,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.550
to lower the production levels at best.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.610
If the trading force stops getting

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.070
those data or they are not

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.510
correct, we will produce much

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.270
more than we need and that will

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.630
ultimately impact the sales force.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.150
We'll have a much larger stock that

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.250
they'll have to take them somehow

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.710
forward, so even if it's initially

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.950
a lot more work for them

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.210
to put all those business opportunities

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.110
in and upgrade them,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.490
in the bottom it's going

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.130
to be a lot more beneficial

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.090
for them.
