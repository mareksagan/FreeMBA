00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.500
To finish, we will analyze what

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.920
Silvia has told us and we

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.700
will relate it to the segmentation

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.860
variables we have

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.420
learned.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.520
She told us that they have

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.600
traditionally segmented based on

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.320
the geography where their customers

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.720
live and mainly based on demographic

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.280
factors such as age, sex and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.840
sociocultural level, taking

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.300
into account that the OEB

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.380
is a luxury product.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.200
They have also incorporated a analysis

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.940
of the profiles that is psychographic

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.100
segmentation, such as personality,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.960
if they are cosmopolitan,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.220
lifestyle, etc.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, all these variables that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.220
are the traditional ones

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.680
allow us to know who our customers

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.900
are.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600
But as she said, they don’t serve

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.140
us for anything because what they

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.760
don’t serve us is to understand

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.880
why our customers buy us, which is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.420
something very valuable, it’s a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.660
very valuable knowledge.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.740
What is the evolution of all this?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700
Well, on the one hand, thanks

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.380
to the internet, thanks to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.640
all interactions on social media,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.160
etc., we have a lot more

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.880
information from customers,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.740
so we can do a much larger

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.040
segmentation.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.300
Even in the perfume, as Silvia

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.940
told us, it could be given total

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.160
personalization, that is, that each

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.020
person will buy a different

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.960
perfume adapted to their tastes.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.840
And in addition, the last thing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600
we told us is that the brands are

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.320
doing is to overcome the product-

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.360
centric approach, stop looking

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.960
at the umbilical and start

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.060
thinking why customers buy them.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.560
This is the latest of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.480
the segments and it is the perspective

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.360
that we propose whenever

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.580
all companies incorporate.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.780
Why are they buying us?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.040
What are they looking for in us?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.360
But look at it, she proposed,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.080
even in the perfume sector, to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.600
go beyond.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.840
And what we can do is not segment

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.620
by person, that is, this person

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.460
is looking for a certain thing

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.220
in us, this person is something

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.960
else, etc.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.280
No, we can go beyond and segment

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.740
each person or analyze it according

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.040
to the moments of their life.
