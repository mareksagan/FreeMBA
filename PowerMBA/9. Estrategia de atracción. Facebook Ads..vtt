00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.170
Quicks, thank you very much.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.990
Today we are with Quique Corral, who

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.470
is one of my partners, one of the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.770
co-founders of The Power MBA and

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.050
is the craftsman of, among other

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.530
things, the capture strategy in

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.090
social media.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.790
That by the way, what we are

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.790
doing has become and puts us as

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.250
an example in many places and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.850
more.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.510
What I want us to do today is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.170
that Quique teaches us

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.010
how platforms work.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.650
The platforms are Facebook, Twitter,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.510
LinkedIn and so on.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.890
And we will do it with Facebook,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.870
which is the largest and the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.010
others work similarly, but I want

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.330
us to see how they work, that

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.910
is, that you view the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.230
platform, how an ad is placed

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.890
and more.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.570
And what we're going to do

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.170
is share the screen, but before I

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.890
would like to talk about something

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.170
a little more strategic and it's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.430
when we put a campaign on social

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.550
media there's always an objective.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.650
Let's say that is the first part.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.170
What are the objectives?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, unlike the advantages

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.070
that social networks have among

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.550
other channels, such as putting

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.250
an ad on television, it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.870
that you can accompany

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.770
and create goals accompanying

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.910
all the hunger.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.390
You create an objective within the platform

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.950
that you associate with that objective,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.610
you associate a metric with it, and

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.050
the platform optimizes that metric.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.290
This is done for every campaign.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.250
for every campaign.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.070
You create campaigns based on your

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.510
goals and based on your goals you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.270
create, that is, optimize

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.370
them to those metrics.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.090
Then, for example, awareness,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.530
that you can create brand

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.010
awareness campaigns, reach,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.150
video viewing, etc.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.070
So the more videos people see,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.150
the better, because it optimizes

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.090
the viewing of videos.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.270
This first goal, awareness,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.210
or awareness branding, this is basically,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.590
the goal of the campaign is not,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.950
you are not thinking so much

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.190
about conversion, you are not thinking

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.430
about visits, you are not thinking

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.390
about traffic, your strategic

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.930
goal is to get to know you.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.870
and yes.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.030
That can be for, well, because

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.190
usually the big companies do that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.510
what they want is, because imagine

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.010
Coca-Cola on Facebook, because

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.290
what they want is to be present

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.550
in the mind of the customer.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.670
Then you have other types of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.770
goals, such as traffic, generating

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.190
traffic on your website, because

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.750
the platform will optimize

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.690
for people to get to your

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.350
website.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.890
Conversion, conversion to lead,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.010
that is, that people can get to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.150
leave the data or even to sell.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.030
That would be the objectives, roughly,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.750
of prospecting, that is, of generation,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.890
but you can also create remarketing

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.990
goals, that is, of people who have

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.890
already been impacted, people

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.110
who have already entered your web

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.530
or even left the data, but you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.490
want to re-impact

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.090
them, because so that they

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.750
either leave the data or buy.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.090
and yes.
