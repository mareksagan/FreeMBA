00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.690
Today we will analyze the Spotify

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.690
business model and we will do

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.110
so to reinforce some of the concepts

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.430
learned in particular with respect

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.470
to the revenue flows we saw

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.290
in the previous class.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.430
To do this we have been gathered

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.130
with Rodrigo who is one of the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.330
leaders, one of the Spotify managers

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.370
in Spain and what we will do

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.730
is first we will do a couple of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.450
cuts of the talk with Rodrigo

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.750
and then we will analyze

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.810
from the canvas, from the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.030
perspective of the business

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.690
model what Rodrigo has told us.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.630
Spotify reaches an agreement with the owners

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.150
of the content, in this case with the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.270
recording companies, and pays them for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.810
the consumption of that content.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.390
Those are the costs that Spotify

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.430
has and then pays them for having

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.370
premium content, in our case

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.790
it doesn’t hear advertising and

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.910
a lot of premium-only features

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.570
or brands are those that

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.130
support or sponsor free

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.510
users at the expense

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.190
of listening to or seeing their

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.210
advertising.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.570
Well, the main advantage

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.590
I understand is that you do not

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.090
depend on a single financing

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.830
route and then if you have a content

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.910
that is attractive to users you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.870
can tie a lot of people who are

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.090
used to pay for digital content

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.990
for your content and those

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.710
who are not used to pay for

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.710
digital content you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.290
can convince brands so

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.050
that they can pay say between

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.630
the lines or sponsor

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.470
the consumption of that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.110
content.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.090
I think that is the main advantage.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.410
The main disadvantage that the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.950
market can have is that you have

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570
to enter a market that is mature

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.990
so that users can get to pay

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.270
at a given time, go through

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.710
that funnel that is to try the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.950
product for free, see the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.550
needs that are making me

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.430
get that product and be

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.770
willing to pay for it.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.750
So that’s not all markets

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.590
are ready, not all users

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.890
or all kinds of content

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.250
is accessible so users

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.950
pay for it in all

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.550
markets.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.110
In fact, there have been

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.270
many problems in Spain for

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.610
many years so that users are

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.370
used to paying for television

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.110
series film content.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.830
Now not, but five or six years ago it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.970
was totally unthinkable that people would

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.070
pay for it.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.420
Now that we have heard of Rodrigo

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.620
what we will do is do the analysis

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.160
from the business model point

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.600
of view and we will use the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.260
Remember that talked to us

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.960
that Spotify has two ways

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.280
of monetization.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660
On the one hand, free users are subsidized

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.980
by the brands that are advertised

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.500
on Spotify and on the other hand,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.500
there is a percentage of users

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.800
who pay the premium fee,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800
the subscription every month.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.280
Therefore, from the point of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.420
view of business model analysis,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000
it combines two sources of revenue,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.960
the premium model we saw in the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.260
previous class and the advertising

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.740
model.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.980
We will see it in the canvas.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.100
Let’s start with the advertising model.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.820
Spotify offers free music to

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.200
millions and millions of people

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.280
around the world and what it does

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.120
is monetize them through advertisers,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.540
brands that are advertised

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.680
on Spotify.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.460
We have the first source of income.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.020
This is clearly a advertising

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.740
model like a free digital

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.260
newspaper could

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.880
be.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.840
The model is the same, it is to

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.840
attract a lot of people by offering

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.500
free content and that critical

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.860
mass of users is monetized

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.200
by means of brand ads or the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200
usual model of classified.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.980
It works so.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.600
The canvas would be very similar

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.200
but also Spotify does incorporate

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.660
a second source of income

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.360
that is premium quotas.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.780
Therefore, we can also say that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.400
it is a premium business model

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.620
and we have it here drawn.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.620
We also added green to heavy

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.600
users, users who pay for

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.180
their subscription every

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.780
month.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.340
As Rodrigo said, Spotify’s

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.820
challenge is to convert as

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.060
many free users as possible

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.080
into premium users that usually

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.560
premium business models

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.800
do not usually have more

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.480
than a 10% of users who pay

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.500
the fee.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.960
Let us now look at the advantages

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.460
and disadvantages of this

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.940
model.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.600
I think it is very obvious that

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240
this type of advertising models,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.160
premium, etc., generally allow

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.900
you to grow very fast because

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.440
your basic service is free.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.180
On the other hand, you have the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.560
challenge of turning users

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.520
into premium because there

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.220
are many occasions when users get

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.580
used to the free service

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.540
or you are not able to demonstrate

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.420
enough value for them to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.200
pay the fee.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.500
This is a challenge that companies

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.100
that offer this type of

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.300
services have to overcome.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.760
One disadvantage to consider

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.720
is that in these models your

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.220
financial needs are huge because

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.320
you have to reach much more

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.240
critical.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.100
When you are not charging

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.460
anything for your users,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.200
you need to capitalize well.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.660
Think of Spotify.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.180
Spotify is coming to a country.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.040
The first thing it does is offer

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.480
you a free service until it wins

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.600
millions of users.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.660
At first, it is even very difficult

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.040
to negotiate with brands when you

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.320
don’t have a lot of volume.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840
So, that’s why I say you

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.600
have to be very strongly capitalized.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.520
And another analysis I want to do

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.820
is that I want you to be clear that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.580
the premium model in general or the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.220
free model in general is only sustained

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.680
when the marginal cost of providing

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.360
those free services of

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.180
having a more customer tends

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.640
to zero.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.780
I give you an example.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.120
A digital newspaper.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.980
A digital newspaper can have millions

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:43.040
and millions of the cost in this

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.320
case is that it is zero.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.820
Spotify can offer its basic service

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.940
to millions more people at very

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.800
very very very little extra cost.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.200
That is the key.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.860
The key is that the marginal cost

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.920
of having free users is very

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.060
low.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.960
You will also monetize them in different

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.280
ways, but that has to be

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.160
the way.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.520
That is a requirement that must be

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.420
given because if you are costly

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.880
to provide the service to free users

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.080
because obviously the business

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.660
model is not profitable.
