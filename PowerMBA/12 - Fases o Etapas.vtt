00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160
It is absolutely key that

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.580
you understand what the phases

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.740
of a product development or business

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.700
model in a start-up are.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.880
And eye, I speak of development

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.800
phases, are the phases related

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.740
to the business, because there

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.820
are other phases that are related

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.960
to how to finance that development,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.360
we will see them, and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.180
they have to go alongside.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.900
These phases, what they describe us, are

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.320
landmarks.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.860
That is, they are milestones of advance,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.340
they are milestones of learning, it

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.360
is not a matter of time, it can take

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.840
you more or less time, or it may

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.920
be that you never reach even the first

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.020
of the milestones.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.480
These are milestones that we are

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.940
achieving, we are validating,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.040
and that allow us to make the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.340
company more valuable and the risk

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.820
less.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.560
When a start-up, which is an idea,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.180
is born in the founder's head,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.480
well, because the risk is very high,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.380
because you have to prove everything,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.000
and the company is worth nothing,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.220
but as we move forward, the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.820
thing turns.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.260
To explain the relationship between lean

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.580
start-up and these phases, and the development

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.440
phases, I like to explain

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.040
it like this.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.440
Lean start-up is a method that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.040
helps us and teaches us to innovate.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.280


00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.720
How is?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380
Well, with a cycle in which it tells

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.460
you that every time you have to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.800
innovate or validate something,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.860
what you have to do is identify

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.220
the hypotheses and do very quick

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460
experiments to measure and to evolve.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.840
So I advance it.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.960
Stage to Stage.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.480
But the Lean start-up book doesn'

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.460
t really illustrate what the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.760
different stages are.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.800
This is complemented by

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.860
us mainly through another methodology

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.940
called customer development,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.800
customer development.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.340


00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.120
Well, the stages are drawn

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.280
in this way in this picture,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.060
instead of horizontally,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.280
we draw them vertically, and we

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.760
will go see one by one, and we

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.960
start with the first of the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.880
landmarks.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.240
When a company is born, the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.780
first of the milestones, your

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.700
first goal is to problem, solution

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.660
fit.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.200
There is a difference between the problem

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.160
and the solution.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.660
And it is a pre-phase, it is an embryonic

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.280
phase in which the strategic

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.720
approach must be discovered.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.960
Find out why you don't have any

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.360
idea.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.140
If you see it on the link, both of them are like that.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.520
We have to validate

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.860
if there is actually a problem,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.460
a problem that people are

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.480
willing to pay for that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.860
problem, to solve it.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.200
And, in addition, first is the problem,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.320
but then it is the solution, because

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.080
we have to validate that your

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.140
proposal, the technology you propose

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.200
or the service you propose

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.080
actually gives the solution to that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.920
problem, because in many cases

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.900
it is not so.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.380
There are many entrepreneurs

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.540
who have an idea and that is true

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.400
that this problem can exist.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.820
I don't know, solving parking in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.860
the big cities, for example, is a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060
huge problem that still really

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.660
no one has given some very powerful

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300
solution, but that when someone

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.660
gives as a solution parking

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.360
in the big cities or reduce

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.760
traffic, because it will

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.980
have an immense business.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.160
Therefore, we have to validate the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.120
problem, we have to validate the solution

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.380
and at that point we reach problem,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.080
solution fit, which is the first

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.160
of the milestones of advance,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.800
the first of the stages.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.920
And we have to get here by

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.620
spending as little money as possible

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.160
and as little time as possible, using

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.520
the Lean startup methodology,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.380
as much as possible.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.680
The second of the milestones of

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.680
the goals we have to pursue

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.620
and is a very important word

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.680
that you have to understand very

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.240
well is product market fit.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.240
When do you reach product market fit?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.280
Well, you reach product market

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.020
fit when you can validate

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.300
your business model more comprehensively.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.480


00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.140
How do you value it?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.420
Well, because it turns out that at

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.060
that time there is already enough

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.020
people who have bought you, that

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.300
you have checked that they provide

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.040
value, that they are not discounted,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.660
that other people recommend it,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.240
you have checked that you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.360
can reach them through channels

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.620
that are profitable to you, etc.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.980
Mark Andresen, a product market

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.800
fit designer, said that when

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.420
you reach product market fit,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.100
you can feel it, you know.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.940
It's like, I compare it to if you'

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.680
re in love, if you're in

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.460
love you know, because when you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.760
reach product market fit and suddenly

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.060
things improve because you've given

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.720
up something that people want

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.980
to buy, well, sales are shot,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.120
you get a quote from customers,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.820
even the press contacts you because

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.020
you've given up something

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.200
new, etc.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.600
At this point, to reach the product

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.920
market fit, the most convenient

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.740
thing is, we need a minimum

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.620
viable product, we need,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.460
we no longer have to do small

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.600
experiments, what we have to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.980
do is, we have to have a product

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.120
with which people can interact,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.260
that we can buy, that we

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.400
can have relationship with

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.720
customers, we have to validate

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.180
the entire business model

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.400
in this way.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.740
Well, we've already reached product

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.520
market fit, very good news because

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.960
a lot of companies never get

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.780
it, they're never able to

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.740
build something people want

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.360
to buy.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.340
And the next step, the next step,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.400
is to prepare ourselves to grow

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400
and find out what is our growth engine.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.280
Why is?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.780
I will illustrate it.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.200
Until now you have something that

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.500
you know works, you have something

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.260
that you know people want to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.500
buy, there are enough customers

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.620
that have bought and you have validated

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.760
first-hand that they like, but

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.060
really from here to have a very

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.100
large company, there are many

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.660
challenges, there are many

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.720
things to validate along the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.900
way yet, you have to validate the

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.400
growth engine, you have to validate

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.980
what will be the channels,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.500
the mechanisms that will make

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.540
you have a very large company.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.540


00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920
Mierson Ellis is the growth hacker

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.480
by excellence, in fact he is the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.800
father of the term also, of growth

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.620
hacking, he draw us in another way,

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.940
he draw us a few simpler phases

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.500
and does it with a pyramid, he tells

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.560
us that first you have to reach product

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.860
market fit that we have already

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.120
reached and then you have to

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.320
prepare to grow and finally what

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.340
you do is to grow or scale and

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.500
also says that if this intermediate

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.180
phase of preparing to grow

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.800
you do well, the profitability you

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.710
will have is five times greater,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.870
that if you start to grow, that

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.450
if you start to scale before

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.010
you prepare, before looking

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.230
for efficiency, efficiency

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.750
is the strategic approach

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.150
this phase.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.350
How will we go through this phase?

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.470
Well, what we will do is start

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.110
validating especially the channels

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.050
through which we can reach

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.390
and seek that efficiency in terms

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.750
of maximizing the profitability

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.850
of each of those channels, because

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.810
with metrics, for example, such

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.030
as the customer, the extreme

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.110
value, less the cost of acquiring

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.690
customers.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.970
Basically we have to look for our

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.130
way, we have to look for profitable

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.650
ways and I like to put several examples

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.630
so that you understand

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.630
it well.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.030
One of them is, we have reached

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.790
product market fit, we have a

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.470
product that we are seeing that

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.870
works, a product that we are seeing

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.450
that people like, what happens is

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.130
that so far we have validated

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.370
it on a small scale, but we have

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.350
clear that it is something

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.350
potent what we have.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.750
We have 10 million euros

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.270
on the table to grow.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.370
Well, it is very possible that you

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.670
do not know what to do with those

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.210
10 million, because you do not

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.010
have the channels ready to grow, you

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.370
do not have, no, to start with

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.190
you do not have, because

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.450
imagine, delegations in other countries,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.230
you do not have marketing channels

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.390
to invest 10 million euros, you

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.890
can not yet, you have to

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.210
prepare to grow.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.990
And if, and if they force you to do so,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.170
what would happen is that

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.150
you would waste the vast majority of

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.350
those 10 million because you are not ready.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.870
I explain it this way too.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.310
We have to, we have to cross this

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.370
forest and also we have to do

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.350
it running, because we are in

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.370
the next phase, is, is

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.610
growth, is scale, is grow a lot.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.230
Well, if the forest is like that,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.050
we will go very slowly, we will

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.310
not be able to do so, what we have

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.110
to do is find the way.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.790
We have to find the channels where

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.170
we can put a lot of money to create

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.010
a very big company, because look

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.570
if, if the forest, if the panorama

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.650
we have in front of is this,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.890
that here has found the

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.530
channels, well, because

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.590
we can go even in a car, we

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.790
can speed up a lot.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.810
But this is something that needs to be worked on.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.590
Well, what examples can you,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.630
can I give you when you found it?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.230
Well, when you reach product

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.130
market fit, you have customers,

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.770
the English start to grow, etc.,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.870
but you have to start validating,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.070
looking for more channels

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.570
of customer capture.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.150
Maybe they are offline channels,

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.690
online channels, you have or have

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.630
to have delegations in other countries,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.790
you have to do a lot of things

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.370
to grow very quickly.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.550
The day you reach it, the day you

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.130
reach this milestone, the day

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.390
you validate that you can

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.210
really grow, the day you are sure

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.430
that if you put those 10 million

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.270
euros on the table, you can

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.650
invest them in the most efficient

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.990
way possible.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.270
At that moment, what you have

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.610
to do is very clear.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.730
At that point, what you have to do

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.250
is grow as much as possible, as much

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.790
as possible.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.230
If you have done your duties well in the

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.990
previous phases, here what is needed

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.430
is to step the accelerator as much as possible.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.110
If you don't, you're wrong,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.550
because if you don't, others

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.050
will.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.210
It is a real luck

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.810
to be in this situation.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.430
If you have managed to reach product

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.570
market fit and subsequently validated

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.830
channels, of which you can grow

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.010
and also have the luck to raise

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.010
money, raise capital and have

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.630
enough capital to grow, what

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.950
you have to do is to step the

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.050
accelerator as much as possible

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.650
and turn your company

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.030
into something very valuable.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.290
To scale globally if possible.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.550
As I told you, it is very important

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.950
to understand the phases well and understand

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.150
the strategic approach well, what

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.190
you have to do in each of the mistakes

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.810
that there are, one of the most

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.950
common causes of death in startups,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.490
not understanding this.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.590
And I tell you one thing, if we ask

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.510
the CEOs of many companies, maybe

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.350
they don't even know, which

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.230
is a huge mistake.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.250
We will look at the strategic approach.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.110
If until you have absolutely

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.370
validated, you have reached

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.110
problem solution fit, problem

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.570
market fit and also validated

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.550
the channels through which you

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.170
can grow, the focus we have

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.370
to follow is the focus of looking,

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.890
is the focus of learning.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.810
Wake up from the in startup that

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.930
tells us permanently we have to

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.430
be looking, we have to be learning

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.270
and once you've already given

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.490
up with the business model,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.330
what you have to do is run.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.750
They are very different strategic

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.770
perspectives and in fact business

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.350
and management in general what they

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.550
have always taught us is to

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.530
run and we have to break this scheme

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.430
because until we have the

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.890
business model absolutely validated,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.650
that are those three phases

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.770
as I told you, until that moment

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.290
what we have to do is all our

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.850
head, all the focus, all the

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.850
effort of the company has to

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.630
be in finding that business

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.770
model, not in executing it

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.250
because you still don't know

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.030
what you have to execute.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.030
Do not start doing something that

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.670
we have not yet validated.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.310
On the other hand, as to how to

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.770
invest, well, because until you do

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.170
not find what the business model

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.630
is you have to be very cautious

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.070
with all the investment you make.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.730
You don't have to spend, you don'

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.810
t have to spend a lot of money on

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.470
marketing, you don't have to spend

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.550
a lot of money on public relations,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.610
you don't have to spend a lot

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.390
on creating brand or notoriety.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.490
No, the only thing you have to do

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.430
is learn, it's to look for that

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.210
business model and when you get

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.530
it, when you reach all the milestones,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.210
when you're sure you're already

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.570
ready to grow, here's what you

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.830
have to do at this time yes,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.730
at this time what you have to

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.170
do is invest very aggressively,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.430
as much as possible,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.050
but why?

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.530
Because it is that you can do

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.250
it, because you have a product that

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.790
you like, because you validated that

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.170
customers are happy, that they do

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.750
not drop down and above you validated

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.010
those channels to be able to

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.150
put a lot of money.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.450
What has to worry you?

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.930
What metrics do you have to

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.050
worry about in each of the stages?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.510
Well, because in the initial

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.590
stages, until you have not validated

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.970
the business model in an integral

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.290
way, you do not have to worry

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.270
over sales or growth, you do not

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.370
have to worry about that, you

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.490
have to worry about the metrics

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.190
that Eric Rice recommended

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.470
us in the In Startup, you have

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.350
to worry, the metrics are representative

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.930
that allow you to make decisions,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.570
that allow you to learn, because

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.190
the representative metrics

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.390
that the customer likes what

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.170
we are selling, the representative

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.710
metrics that the

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.510
channels are actually

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.210
profitable, etc.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.490
So, until now don't worry

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.930
over sales, they're not important,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.390
because as you focus on

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.330
growing, you won't

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:40.830
learn.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.030
But once we have validated, that

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.110
we have reached all the milestones,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.450
when we have to scale, then

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.150
here obviously yes, here the

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.450
most important thing is to grow

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.530
very quickly in sales,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.770
in profits, etc.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.290
This is a company where there is

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.330
no longer uncertainty and the metrics

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.810
and management approach must

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.450
be the traditional one.
