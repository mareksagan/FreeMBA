WEBVTT

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.570
Gerardo, thank you very much for being here.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.330
for you on the invitation.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.670
We will talk about a very interesting

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.510
topic that is Agile, which is an

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.210
unstoppable trend, which has been around

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.790
for many years and that is something

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.490
that I think that all Power MBA

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.010
students need to know, understand

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.350
well at least the principles

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.430
of Agile.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.870
In this first class, what we will do

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.510
is understand a little bit what it consists

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.910
of and the first thing I would

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.850
like you to explain to us is

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.030
What are the reasons why Agile

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.630
is born?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.150
Or to answer what problems.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.390
Yes, I think the best way to actually

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.510
start is to explain why you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.710
were born and what it gives the answer.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.910
They are basically two points.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.910
The first is about adaptability,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.470
companies either adapt

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.590
or die.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.890
It's a cliché, but it's a cliché

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.450
because it's true.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.970
We have heard it millions

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.530
of times.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.770
We've heard it a million

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410
times since the 1990s.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.870
And there are a million reasons

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.690
to say it.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.470
And without going too far, Hardware

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.410
Business Review, which is the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.670
best business authority, published

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.070
in 2016 that of every 10 companies

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.490
that existed in the 80s, only

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.110
two of them still survive.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.550
If you look at the time and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.710
life period of a company, in the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.090
1960s, a company that was founded

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.930
could last 60 years, today it

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.250
has dropped dramatically to 10

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.670
or 12.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.590
There are a million people

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.250
who say it, and there are a million

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.790
truths that corroborate it.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.350
If you don't adapt and don't reach

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.190
your time to market, if you don't

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.850
change business, you can die.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.310
This, the cliché, the truth is that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.590
every day is a bigger problem.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.650
Threats are growing every

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.430
day.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.270
If you are a non-agile company, that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.070
is, it is difficult for you to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.210
adapt, define a new strategy.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.310
Well, it is very easy to understand.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.610
If it is difficult for you to adapt, if you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.630
are not agile and you are like a transatlantic,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.590
it doesn't matter whether you are large

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.250
or small because there are small

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.990
companies that are very unagile.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.650
They will be given them everywhere,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.470
and that is the truth.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.910
You will die, point.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.230
There is no other story.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.150
A better example of Borja is the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.170
example of Nokia.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.550
Who didn't have a Nokia or a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.030
Blackberry less than 6 years ago.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.990
And despite that, people like Apple,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.670
people like Samsung came to the market

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.010
and they have completely shattered

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.250
them in a matter of a year.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.150
They have not adapted, they

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.730
are dead.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.070
The market share they have is poor,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.770
the income is poor and they

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.590
are a company that goes bankrupt.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.150
Yes, but that example you put,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.590
to the small businessman you say,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.130
no, that's another story.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050
If you are a small businessman, it doesn't

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.890
matter what type of company you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.810
have, if you are not adaptable, if you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.270
are not agile, you will die, point.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.730
There is no other story.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.790
In fact, my experience, which

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.150
also goes for all branches of companies,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.170
even in the not so large world,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.810
is because you have not even

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.790
had the opportunity to mount

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.470
entry barriers.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.450
And in that delicate period, as

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.330
you don't adapt, it's much easier

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.490
for you to be pissed and not passed

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.910
over.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.310
That is for me essential, if you don't

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.410
adapt, you die, first argument.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.990
and recorded.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.910
And a second and not

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.570
least important, and is

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.950
also a topic of much concern,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.730
is the level of commitment

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.530
that people have today in the jobs.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.210
The traditional way to manage talent

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.790
doesn't work and people are becoming

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.250
less and less unfaithful to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.670
their company.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.630
He becomes more unfaithful.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.390
Yes, and I will give you a test.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.070
Anyone you know in human resources,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.810
ask them what is one of the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.670
biggest concerns on their

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.790
agenda and they will tell

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.930
you the rotation.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.930
We don't have employees, it's not just

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.210
cost to capture them, but also

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.990
to train and maintain them.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.230
So we're talking about two very

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.650
real points of view that are, I have

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.710
to adapt and I have to do it with

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.830
a talent that I can secure

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.730
in my company.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.510
These are the two great answers

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.410
that Yael has been born with

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.610
and which have proven that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.090
it works.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.690
actually is.
