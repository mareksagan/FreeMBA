00:00.000 --> 00:11.760
I want us to analyze a website because I think it's a spectacular example of how to apply

00:11.760 --> 00:18.200
history and how to transmit it through a website with very clear messages and that from the

00:18.200 --> 00:25.480
first moment they hook the protagonist and make it very clear how they can help him.

00:25.480 --> 00:30.960
This is a company that sells photography courses for a niche, that is, for parents and helps

00:30.960 --> 00:34.320
their parents to get better photos of their children.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.480
We are going to see the homepage from top to bottom and we are going to draw conclusions.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.560
What I would like is for us to learn how they have done it.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.020
We start with the headline, as you can see it is very simple, very clear and tells us

00:50.020 --> 00:53.740
to help parents to get better photos.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.500
What are they achieving in this way?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.460
The first thing they are achieving is that the protagonist, his target audience feels

00:59.460 --> 01:05.220
identified from the first moment because I did it very simple, we help parents.

01:05.220 --> 01:09.580
And also it is transmitting us not only with the text but with the background image, it

01:09.580 --> 01:12.020
is transmitting us really what is the happy end.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.360
What are we going to get?

01:13.360 --> 01:16.800
We are going to get better pictures of our children.

01:16.800 --> 01:23.800
And the next thing in a story is that the protagonist has a problem and if we show him that he has

01:23.800 --> 01:28.800
a problem and that we can help him, our message will be very clear.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.800
And the next thing is that the protagonist is not happy, he is not satisfied, he is not

01:35.800 --> 01:40.800
satisfied with the result, he is not satisfied with the result, he is not satisfied with the

01:41.800 --> 01:46.800
results.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.800
We are going to get better pictures of his children, not only give him goals, but also

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
help catch his heart.

01:52.800 --> 01:59.800
When we show the fake photos of someone we say that we have a problem, there are some

02:00.800 --> 02:06.800
consultancies about this issue, representing us with this kind of fake photos because that

02:06.800 --> 02:11.800
is a waste of time, because he is taking photos that are not good enough.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.800
And there are 86,000 people who are already taking wonderful photos.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.800
But we continue.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.800
And here, the generation of the problem is even bigger.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.800
Our children grow fast.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.800
It is making us see that we are going to lose a unique opportunity if we are not able to

02:30.800 --> 02:32.800
take photos of our children.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.800
Because they will grow and that will never come back.

02:35.800 --> 02:41.800
I think it is really brilliant how they are able to make the protagonist visualize that

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
he has a problem.

02:42.800 --> 02:49.800
And also what I say, be careful, because learning to take good photos usually comes with long

02:49.800 --> 02:52.800
tutorials, with a very technical language, etc.

02:52.800 --> 02:57.800
Here he is identifying the villain, which is the rest of the courses, which are boring,

02:57.800 --> 02:59.800
etc., very complicated.

02:59.800 --> 03:05.800
The protagonist is already dreaming of those wonderful photos of his children.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.800
What happens, and also, is that he knows that he can not miss the opportunity because his children

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
will grow and that will never come back.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
And here they give you the solution.

03:14.800 --> 03:21.800
You have this course, Snackable, which is digestible, that is, simple, microlearning, etc.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Seven parts.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
We put it super easy.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
Shools Photoschool makes it very easy.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.800
Here we have the solution.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.800
This is a very simple course, one week, one minute every day, designed for busy parents,

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
etc., effortlessly.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
As you can see, they have positioned themselves, they are giving you the solution.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.800
And they give you two options here, look, sign up now or if you are not, keep informed or

03:41.800 --> 03:43.800
scroll down.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
And it makes it very clear.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.800
Here they tell us what the plan is, in case you have any questions.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.800
We did not have many doubts, here it will be simple, but in case you have any questions,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
I will make it very clear.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.800
You sign up for free.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
Look at what a simpler language.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.800
Only with an email, no tricks, etc.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
Get one snack per day.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.800
That is, every day a simple class, microlearning, directly to your inbox.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.800
And also, what it tells us here is that they will continue to send us things in the future.

04:11.800 --> 04:18.800
They put us three call to action, but they all go to the same thing, and it is the form in which

04:18.800 --> 04:20.800
we will receive the free course.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.800
As you can see here, what they have done is solve that we have doubts and make it very clear

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
what the plan is, which is something very important in all history.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.800
They put some of the logos, well, to generate some confidence.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.800
But I'm going here, I love this, and it is, as in all history, we have to make him see

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
what is being played.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
Well, transmitting the benefit that he will get and also making him see what risks

04:46.800 --> 04:48.800
we are going to avoid taking.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.800
And this is, this meets perfection, as you are seeing.

04:51.800 --> 04:57.800
They tell us, is that throughout the life of your children you will take many photos.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.800
That you will do yes or yes.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.800
Every father has thousands of photos of his children on his mobile.

05:04.800 --> 05:11.800
And they tell us, you can capture them in a beautiful way and build a treasure for you

05:11.800 --> 05:15.800
and for your children, this is the happy ending, to which they will help you.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
But how are they going to help them?

05:18.800 --> 05:24.800
Be careful, or what can happen is that you do not change anything and what you have are a lot of instant.

05:24.800 --> 05:29.800
Well, there is no translation really to Spanish, but basically what it is saying is that you are going to take

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
many photos.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.800
If you let us help you, you will build a treasure.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
And also look at the photos behind, smiling children, etc.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
We are all visualizing it.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.800
But be careful, what you can do is not do anything and what you will have is a lot of photos

05:43.800 --> 05:46.800
that it seems that it is telling us that these photos are not going to be worth anything.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
And look at what is the call to action, build a treasure.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
Build a treasure, it is really powerful.

05:53.800 --> 06:01.800
Also, use the web page, the homepage, to give testimonies of people who have done the classes, etc.

06:01.800 --> 06:06.800
And use the call to actions very well, join more than 70,000 happy snackers, as they call it.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.800
Join a large community, it is something very aspirational.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.800
It is telling us that there are many people.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.800
You have no doubt that they do it well, because if they have more than 70,000 people...

06:17.800 --> 06:22.800
Finally, what they do is, she introduces herself, who is the founder, Kyle Schultz.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.800
Well, and he tells you a little about his story, a photo of his children, and it becomes more credible.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
It is generating authority.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.800
It is she with her family.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
All the photos are from her family.

06:32.800 --> 06:38.800
To finish, I think it is really brilliant how they have managed to create a story on a web page with very few texts.

06:38.800 --> 06:45.800
The protagonist are the parents, they feel identified from the first moment, and also they have identified what is the desire of those parents.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.800
And it is to have beautiful photos of their children, a treasure that is worth all his life.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.800
A treasure, he uses the word treasure several times in the call to action.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
Therefore, it hooks from the beginning.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.800
And also what he achieves is to make him visualize that he has a problem.

06:58.800 --> 07:04.800
Because his children grow very fast, and because probably they have no idea of ​​photography.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
Well, like everyone.

07:06.800 --> 07:13.800
So the problem is that they will have photos, their children will grow fast and they will have photos that are not as good as they could be.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.800
And that generates an internal problem for the protagonist.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.800
And it is that concern, that desire to say, I'm going to miss a unique opportunity.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.800
And here comes Schultz Photo School and he positions himself as a guide.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
I can help you.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.800
And he tells you exactly how.

07:27.800 --> 07:34.800
What he does is give you a course in seven days, that you will receive an email every day with a very short class, very simple.

07:35.800 --> 07:42.800
And finally, what you are seeing at all times, in a very bright way, is what you are playing.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.800
And what you are playing is, on the one hand, wonderful photos of your children all their lives.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Because we see it in the images.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
They have almost nothing to say to us.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.800
We see it in the images of the website itself.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
And what is the risk that I am helping you to avoid?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.800
Which is almost as powerful as the benefit in this case.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.800
What I'm helping you to avoid is that your children grow.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.800
And in the end, the photos they have are not good enough.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.800
And you are not able to build that treasure that we are going to help you build.
