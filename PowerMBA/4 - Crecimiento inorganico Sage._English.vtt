00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.320
In the program we have studied the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.740
differences and the advantages

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.120
and disadvantages of organic

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.520
and inorganic growth.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.560
What do you look at who they are

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.080
and if you can tell us any anecdote

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.620
of some problem you have

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.440
found in some organ growth

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.160
operation?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.840
First of all, I’ll give you an

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.940
example because I think it can

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.280
serve everyone of how you can grow,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.140
especially in anorganic

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.800
way, which is not the usual.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440
It is common to grow organically

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.620
and during your life to have

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.600
sporadic inorganic growths.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.220
That is the nature of most

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.900
companies.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.500
Companies grow organically and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.000
occasionally make acquisitions

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.380
or mergers that allow them

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.860
to either win a market booth,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.080
or diversify, or have things

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.320
that they can’t organically

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.980
do.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.880
In the case, but look at that also

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.480
gives the chance that was in the case

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.140
of our company, from SP, but then

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.640
especially in the case of Saje,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.420
which is what Saje does in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.960
the world.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800
The vision that Saje had in the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.640
world, which we also shared

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.940
without having met, imagine,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.800
is that we don’t have time to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.180
grow organically, there’s

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.920
no time.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.500
Time to market is brutal.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.420
Of course, if we compare it with what

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.920
I see now, it is no longer brutal,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.440
but at that time compared to what

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.360
had happened before it was brutal.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.200
In a year a market had matured,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
then it didn’t give you time

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.060
to grow organically.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.020
So what are we deciding?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.060
We decided to buy the number one,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:02.840
number two or number three of that is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200
very complicated, it’s very easy

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.440
to say here, but the first thing you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.040
have to want the number one or

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.680
number two or number three to

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.980
sell, you have to be able to somehow

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.480
acquire it, in agreement, and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420
on the other hand you have to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.340
have a price that allows you to acquire it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.060
All these things together at the same

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.920
time are very complicated.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.680
But well, like everything in life,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.980
there is that both our, in my life

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.120
as an entrepreneur, as that that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.360
had Saje, a company listed on the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.780
FTSE 100, with a treasury, brutal

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.460
cash flow, we made the purchases

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.120
directly without leveraging

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.980
us zero.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.920
So all this has allowed the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.200
growth strategy to be very

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.240
fast and the advantage is huge.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.580
What are the huge disadvantages

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.160
that this has?

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.460
First, there is no culture

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.280
in the company.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.620
These people have no culture.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.640
Why is?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.780
Because you’re buying different,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.140
mature cultures in different countries.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.020
When the time comes to switch to centralized

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.920
processes, when the time comes

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.460
to share things, that is

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.660
very difficult, very difficult.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.340
In fact, we have suffered

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.620
it later and there has been

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.760
a huge restructuring that

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.640
has hurt a lot.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.580
Why is?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.960
Because that growth has made the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.020
members of that company have a quasi-

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.640
sympathic half-synchrony

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.600
that didn’t allow them

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.640
all that.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.540
On the contrary, when you have companies

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.960
whose main growth is organic,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.020
they align culturally and allow cultural

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.240
movements like those we see in

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.640
other types of companies that suddenly

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.280
decide to align from one

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.480
business model to another and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.140
with a message or bulletins

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.240
of nothing.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000
That is, South Africans

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.060
compared to Brazilians, compared

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.860
to Europeans, were companies with

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.240
different values, who shared

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.920
a logo, a brand, of course no

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.920
products, because each had

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.060
their own products, and they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.400
listed on the stock market

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.580
all together.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.960
Then, you’ve seen that there have

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.160
been many advantages that

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.440
have allowed us to make a time to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.500
market and be world leaders that

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.640
we’t have been, but there

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.880
have been many problems that

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.780
are not leaving us, that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.960
are not leaving us, to make

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.820
the transformation that the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.000
big company needs.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.760
What is better than worse?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.600
There is no real answer, that

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.460
is, depending on the moment the company

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.480
has, the moment the market needs,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.180
what needs the market has and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.380
what you are able to, you have

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.220
to choose this world, and it

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.940
is that there is no real

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.420
solution.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.880
There is a real solution in every

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.400
moment, in every situation.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.980
That is, I company, it goes very

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.620
well to me, now I have to grow

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.640
organically, but this does not mean

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.840
that within three years my inorganic

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.260
growth axis will not

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.660
be more important.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.320
And it can be an inorganic

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.060
growth moment, because the value

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.960
of the companies, the market environment,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.500
allow me to do things I could

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.880
not do at another time, then these

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.300
companies that say no, no, I just

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.660
go to do this, I don’t want to

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.540
do anything else, they’re wrong,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.540
they’re wrong, you have to be

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.220
flexible, you have to be willing

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.220
to change your strategy according

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.840
to the needs you have.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880
And I think that’s what happened.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.040
We have been at a time when

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.180
we were making big purchases

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.260
and then paralyzed that and

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.780
focused on the axes of

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.720
organic growth.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.540
And then we realized that this cultural

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.740
change was very complicated.
