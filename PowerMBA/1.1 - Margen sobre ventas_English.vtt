WEBVTT

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.320
It is interesting that we analyze

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.240
the relationship between sectors

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.880
or characteristics of a sector

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.380
or of a segment of a sector with

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.400
the margins and I will start

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.660
by putting examples, we will

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.920
see sectors in which the margins

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.700
are very low, because for example

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.120
airlines, especially low cost

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.580
airlines or wholesalers

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.000
or distributors that provide

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.780
basically a logistical value

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.060
in any sector or agricultural

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.240
producers, for example these

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.100
are that have very low margins

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.540
and we go to with higher margins,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.080
because we can think of premium

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.440
competitors within almost

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.940
any sector, for example

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.000
in Ferrari, or we will think

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.780
of a pharmaceutical laboratory,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.860
in this case Phispharma

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.720
that we will then analyze.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.040
You have seen several examples,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.820
we will analyze a little of

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.620
the sectors with high margins

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.340
and low margins from different

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.620
perspectives, I think you will understand

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.380
the concept well, in principle

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.300
the volume of sales is usually

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540
greater in the sectors with lower

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.920
margins, because as you said the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.640
agricultural producing companies,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100
since they are usually companies,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
any company that bills many

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.580
million, but of course they

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.840
earn very little money with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.820
each, if we go to sectors

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.020
with higher margins, because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.900
usually the bills are

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.700
lower.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.420
Think about competitive advantage,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.840
how do you compete?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.340
When your competitive advantage

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740
is based on differentiation,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.020
remember Michael Porter’

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.320
s generic strategies, this usually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.160
allows you to have a margin,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.520
have larger, larger margins,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.600
however companies with low

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.320
margins are usually companies

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.540
as we saw with very

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.520
large sales volumes that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.480
seek economics of scale and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.640
usually seek cost leadership.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.220


00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.820
Why is?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.360
Because price sensitivity is much

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.480
higher in this type of companies,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.680
they choose you almost by

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640
price, but when price sensitivity

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.860
is low, because your competitive

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.480
advantage is differentiation,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.460
etc., there you can have

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.500
much higher margins.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.480
Another perspective of which

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.020
we can, since we can analyze

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.440
it, although it is very simple,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680
is value added, usually when

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.300
a company is able to provide

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.940
a lot of value added, that allows

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.100
you to have higher margins.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.340
Let us look at concrete examples.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.420
The first thing we will analyze is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900
the pharmaceutical sector and we

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020
will analyze three companies within

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.400
the supply chain.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.500
We started with a laboratory,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.880
in this case we have taken the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.300
annual accounts of Faes Pharma,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.920
think what the laboratory

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.760
does, research, patents, new

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.860
products, much value

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.460
in the chain.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.580
We have the wholesalers, who

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.620
in this case is Cofares, the leader

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.900
in Spain, who does what is, has

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.420
a huge logistical structure,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.080
with thousands of employees,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.220
and what he does is, well, because

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.440
to supply the pharmacies of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.600
the products of the laboratories.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.560
And finally we have the pharmacies,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.700
they serve the customer, etc.,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.140
you already understand the concept

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.760
of a pharmacy.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.080
And what we’re going to do now is,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.180
let’s analyze the margins of the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.800
three types of the three companies.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.140
Look, Faes Pharma bills 214 million

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.920
and Cofares 2,700, but already when

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.280
we go down to the gross margin,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.920
here we are seeing directly the effect

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.780
of what we were talking about

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.620
before.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.780
The laboratory has a 70% gross margin

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.700
and Cofares has a 7%, in the case

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.000
of the pharmacy it is an average

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080
of 30%.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.660
This answers many questions,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.760
who is bringing more value

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.440
within the supply chain?

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.560
We continue to go down and see

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.580
for example the wholesaler,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720
remember how the business is, the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.080
wholesaler mainly provides a value

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.940
that is purely logistical

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.000
and has a 1.5% and the pharmacy

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.600
a 12.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.280
Please note that the data is very representative.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.040
Faes Pharma with a turnover of 214

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.000
million has a avoidance of 47,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.680
while the wholesale Cofares

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.360
to have a avoidance of 41 has to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.760
bill 2,700 and if we continue

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.920
to fall, well, because the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.200
effect is more dramatic.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.200
In the case of Faes Pharma it has

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.620
a profit of 30 million meters and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.820
the net margin, fix them, is 15%,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.100
is spectacular.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.000
In the case of Cofares, the margin

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.560
is very low and in the end what it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.840
does is to win 11 million

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.440
with a turnover of 2.700 million,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.320
a giant structure.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.500
We will compare the two companies

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.040
that provide services to other

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.240
B2B companies, providing professional

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
services of different

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.760
types.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.280
On the one hand we have Oliver Wyman

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.360
who is a strategic consultant, in this

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.860
case we have analyzed, we have

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.980
taken out the accounts of Oliver

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.300
Wyman in Spain and what he does

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.480
is basically provide outsourcing

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.520
services with staff.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.300
Let’s compare the margins.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.240
In the case of the strategic

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.180
consultancy has sales in Spain

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.940
of 58 million and Eulen has

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.400
1.300 million.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.740
This, if we go down,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.660
is very representative.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.440
Oliver Wyman has 124 employees

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.720
and Eulen has almost 82,000

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.660
and Oliver Wyman’s evita is 4.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.220
5 million and Eulen’s 72,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.860
but if we go to the margin, as

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.220
we see the margin is much

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.240
larger in the case of Oliver

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.920
Wyman.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.540
Why is?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.920
These are services of great

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.140
added value.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.820
A strategic consultant, obviously,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.180
someone who for now charges a lot

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.540
but who participates in very important

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.760
processes of another company,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.540
is not comparable in terms

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.420
of added value to outsourcing

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.680
services of staff

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.540
of all kinds.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.520
To finish, we will make a comparison

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.980
that is very representative

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.120
of what we are saying.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.060
Let’s compare Facebook with Walmart,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.920
which are two of the world’

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.060
s billionaire and leading

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.460
companies.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.330
Let’s compare sales, the number

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.030
of employees and profit and

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.630
margin.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.650
Let’s start with sales.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.450
Facebook has sales of 40

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.030
billion and Walmart is

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.310
more than 10 times larger.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.190
Facebook has 25,000 employees

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.270
and Walmart has 2 million.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.630
A real barbarism.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.990
But here when we get to the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.450
profit is when the surprises begin.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.430
Facebook’s profits are three times

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.270
greater than those of Walmart.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.880
We see this in the net.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.700
Facebook’s share is 37 and a

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.120
half percent.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.580
It is a real barbarism.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.060
It is a company that believes that it

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.720
creates spectacular added value.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.700
It has huge barriers to entry.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.700
That has thousands and thousands and

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.340
thousands of loyal business customers

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.840
spending a folder monthly on

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.300
Facebook.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.500
Find out what the margin is.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.920
This is a very important

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920
indicator of the health of the business.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.880
In contrast, Walmart, which

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.540
is a $5 billion-earned company,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.160
i.e. a giant company, has a margin

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.780
of 1% because it really

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.700
competes for that.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.880
Absolutely lead something

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.260
in cost, seeking scale

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.380
economy, etc.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.960
But the added value it brings

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.860
is much lower.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.980
And as we said, when your value

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.820
added is low, when customers

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.860
choose you by price, etc., at

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.960
the end of the day your margins

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.220
are lower.
