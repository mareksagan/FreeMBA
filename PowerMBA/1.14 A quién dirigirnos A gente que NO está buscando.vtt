WEBVTT

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.640
We will analyze the overall strategy

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.140
of segmentation and targeting

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.040
of a personal trainer.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.420
This is a generic, but probably

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.080
almost everyone acts like that.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.440
And we'll relate it to what we're

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.580
talking about targeting, that instead

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.820
of directing you to the people

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.300
you're already looking for, what

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.080
we're going to try is to direct us

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.640
to the people and convince

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.000
the people that are not still

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.420
looking but that they have that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.920
problem.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.080
First, what do personal

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.340
trainers do?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.200
To whom are they addressed?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.600
Who are your messages

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.780
and suggestions for?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.200
For the people you are looking for.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.000
A personal trainer does what it does

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.640
is compete within that portion,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.780
that quesito.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.000
Then try to compete with your

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.340
competitors who are other

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.760
personal trainers,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.680
gyms, etc.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.520
I don't know, being a little better,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.720
selling better, etc.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.480
That is what they do.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.600
Now let's go to the segmentation

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.080
strategy, which is very interesting.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.800
Do they somehow segment, look for

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.280
specific people to adapt their

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.640
proposal and their messages

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.540
and others?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.960
I don't know anyone who does

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.640
it, I say.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.560
They generally do not segment.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500
They are aimed at everyone who

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.860
is looking for a personal trainer.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560
And within that all of you have

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.260
people who have very different

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.940
problems, seeking different benefits.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.700
It can be segmented by problem and by benefit.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.400
People who want to, I know, get rid of.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.900
People who want to stay in shape.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.000
People who want to be strong.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.760
Things like that, right?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.720
They are not segmented.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.980
Not even by age.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.760
They do not segment, because they do

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.320
not adapt their proposals.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.640
So is it.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600
They have customers of all kinds.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.800
I am a woman who is training

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.020
a woman of 60 years.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.360
And then they're training a 25-

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.520
year-old guy who wants to gain more

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.020
in muscle.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.260
When you don't segment, what happens

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
is that it's harder to differentiate.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.220
And it's harder for your messages, your

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.020
proposal, your product to be more

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.340
convincing, more powerful.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.000
That is clear.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.540
Let us see as a suggested evolution.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.420
What happens to us, right?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.780
well well.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.900
To begin with, instead of not

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.200
segmenting, what they could do is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.880
segment more.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.040
More segmentation looking for a very specific

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.060
customer person.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.340
A very specific niche.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.240
And how could they do it?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.560
For example, by segmenting

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.400
by problem or by benefit.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.320
We said several, right?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.140
Imagine it though.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.620
You can have a customer person of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.660
people who want to gain more in muscle.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.680
There is a lot of competition, right?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.980
People go to the gym and so on.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.200
You can have customer person of people

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.980
who want to crawl.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.100
This is powerful.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.680
If you adapt to this much, you

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.620
can surely generate a lot of additional

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.420
market.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.480
But let us say.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.860
You can have a customer

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.100
person of people who have

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.520
a very specific problem.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.980
They are aware but they are not

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.500
looking for it.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.840
What is?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.220
Imagine people over 60 years old who

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.480
are beginning to feel they are

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480
getting older badly and more.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.340
You can segment in that customer person.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.440
You can create a design adapted

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.960
to that customer person.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.040
with an adapted method.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.160
with adapted messages.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.560
That you are able to convince thousands

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.980
and thousands of people that are

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.200
within this customer person.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.340
They have this problem.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.380
But that still, very

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.100
likely, is still that they have

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.940
not been raised.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.260
They are not looking for a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.020
personal trainer.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.140
This personal customer is not

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.540
looking for a personal trainer.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.040
But an eye.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.620
If someone goes to them and shows

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.120
them.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.260
that actually.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.600
well well.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.600
How they are getting older.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.700
He makes a proposal for that.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
I do not know the proposal anymore.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.660
Because I am not dedicated to this.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.760
It should be a suitable method

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.660
etc.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.000
etc.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.660
Someone tells them.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.900
You are not worried.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.880
Two days a week, etc.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.360
etc.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.900
We will.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.400
well well.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.400
You are getting old.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.580
Instead of getting much better.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.600
You will see better.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.860
You will feel better.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.280
You will have more energy.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.720
etc.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.920
etc.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300
Look at the power.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.760
What the personal trainer

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.360
would be doing.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.600
in this case.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.520
would be.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.460
to direct.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.980
Instead of fighting.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.100
People are looking for a coach.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.720
In the red ocean, etc.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.460
What an annoyance.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.940
Fight with others.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.920
Do the same etc.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.100
It is a great way to increase the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.820
size of the market.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.420
Go to people you are not looking

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.280
for yet.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.860
That can.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.460
If you let him see.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.980
You are aware of the problem you have.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.660
That bread.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.920
And they also have.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.200
I am sure they have those.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.560
They seek those benefits.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.560
Feel better etc.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.940
etc.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.040
They are not looking for a personal

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.700
trainer.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.720
If you enter there.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.940
You position yourself there.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.480
You are addressing someone.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480
Be your target audience.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.700
And have that bread and more.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.980
That he is not looking for.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.060
He will not be looking for any

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.960
more personal trainers.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.620
Not even a cousin.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.640
You buy safe.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.740
How to do?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.480
well well.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.340
We have already seen.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.500
Adjust the proposal and so on.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.100
And then there are tactics to do so.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.000
There are many tactics online.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.460
It is a lead magnet.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.200
You offer something of great value.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.320
Imagine it though.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.120
The five keys.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.960
For that and that.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320
Take leads and more.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.440
But I will not advance to this.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.040
Because we will see that.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.440
When we learn.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.760
to communicate.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.900
The messages are good.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.860
And the entire strategy.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.160
and ether.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.100
and ether.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.980
to convince you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.000
What we have to do is stay with

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.500
this.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.300
It is almost always possible.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.220
and expand.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.500
Think a little differently.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.120
Do you know?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.880
Get out of the box.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.740
Thinking outside the box.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.540
and try.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.020
Creating of proposals.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.960
and adapted.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.200
People who are not looking for.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.320
You can have those pains.
