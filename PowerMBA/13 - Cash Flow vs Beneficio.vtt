00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.080
The first thing we have to do

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.380
is define the concept, the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.560
term, because you may not have

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.580
the whole clear.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.180
Cash flow, cash flow, cash

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.820
flow, cash flow, or cash

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.380
flow, is the amount

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900
of cash generated in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.280
the company over a period

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.180
of time.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.660
That is, at the end of the day

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.840
is the difference between all charges

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.060
and all payments.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.020
The company buys commodities,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.620
invests in fixed assets, pays

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.800
employees, pays suppliers,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.140
receives loans, returns

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.200
them, pays interest, pays

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.760
dividends, many cash flow

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.320
movements occur, and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.060
cash flow is the difference

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.580
between all of

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.640
them.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's compare the net profit,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.720
which is a magnitude you know,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.040
with the cash flow and so we'll

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.240
see what the differences are and why

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.740
you need to use one or another magnitude

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.500
depending on the circumstances.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.900
The first thing, net profit is

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.900
the difference between all income

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.060
and all expenses, and cash flow

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.460
is the difference between all

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.840
charges and all payments.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.680
Net profit and profit magnitudes,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.880
such as EBITDA, gross profit,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.240
gross margin, etc., are

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.100
accounting magnitudes.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.000
I mean, these are subjective

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.160
dimensions.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.600
Why is?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.180
Because they depend on the interpretation

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.180
of the rules, they depend on

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.840
the tax regulations of each country,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.000
they depend on others, and there

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.200
is a certain margin or some

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.600
flexibility that allows you to report

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.620
a net profit greater or lesser.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.600
You can play with the amortisations,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.940
you can periodize

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.260
expenses and income.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.540
However, the cash flow is a totally

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.400
objective magnitude, you can'

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.800
t incide on this, here there is no

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.400
adjustment that is valid, it

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.820
is the treasury or cash that has

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.960
been generated for a period

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.900
of time and there is no mechanism

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.140
to influence it.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.160
I would say that the main difference

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.340
or the main conclusion

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.400
is that net profit does not

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100
take into account the potential

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.520
liquidity problems a company

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.420
may have.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.980
Well, it's very easy to say that

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.940
companies are reporting

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.160
a positive net profit and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.600
are apparently in a situation

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000
of bonanza, but have a lot of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.680
trouble paying off their debts

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.380
or even paying off their

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.700
employees, their suppliers,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.460
etc.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.100
And what is this due to?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.560
This is due to a number of circumstances

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.840
that we will be going to see.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.020
One of them is that you do not

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.960
take into account the timing of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.080
payments and charges, income and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.520
expenses is not the same as payments

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.880
and charges, so you can give circumstances

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.100
like the one we will see.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.900
Imagine a lawyer's office that is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.240
the first year of life and has captured

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.020
a very powerful client to whom

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.680
it has billed a million dollars.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.240
During that first year, he has

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.800
expenses worth $300,000,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.200
three employees, offices,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.240
etc.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.380
He has a profit of $700,000

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.860
in his first year of life.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.320
However, there is a problem, a problem

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.840
that the State of Results does not

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020
consider and that is not considered

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.720
in the benefit and is that it has

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.120
not yet been charged from the customer

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.800
because a payment form has been

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.880
agreed in which the totality

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.100
of the payment, that is, the million

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160
euros, will be perceived at

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.920
the end of the project.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.820
As we are seeing, in this case the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.080
magnitude of the profit has not

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.460
informed us of that liquidity problem

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.620
that the company has had.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.400
So, go to the cash flow

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.980
and see.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.140
We have a profit of $700,000.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.180
However, what we have to do is

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.380
adjust and deduct that million

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.780
dollars that we haven't yet

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.840
collected.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.940
Well, at the start of the activity

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.160
the partners put $100,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.420
000 to capitalize the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.240
company, but during this first

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.740
year a $200,000 mismatch

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.000
has occurred.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.960
They have been forced to apply for

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.420
an additional debt because

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.280
they needed those $200,000 to

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.580
take on the 300,000 expenses

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.740
to pay employees, for example.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.340
Another reason that net profit

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.680
is not able to reflect whether

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.420
we will have liquidity

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.320
problems or not is that it does

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.760
not reflect the necessary

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.460
investments in fixed assets,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.760
unlike cash flow that considers

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.120
absolutely all charges

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.860
and all payments.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.800
Let's look at another case.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.980
In this case, we have a transport

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.080
company.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.320
During the year, he has achieved

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.760
a result, a net profit of

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.800
$200,000.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.620
However, the state of results,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.780
the net profit doesn't inform us

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.400
is that it has been forced to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.160
renew two trucks of its fleet to

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.020
be able to continue providing

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.000
the service to its customers.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.400
These two trucks required

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.180
an investment of $300,000.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.560
As we can see, a profit of 200,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.880
000 minus an investment of $300,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.460
000 has needed an additional

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.680
$100,000 to be able to fund

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.480
your activity.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.680
Therefore, it has been forced to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.800
make an additional capital increase

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.760
that it did not have in mind.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.880
The partners had to take on or

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.580
put an additional $100,000 inside

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.140
the company to continue

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.960
operating.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.240
As we see, it is another example that

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.560
the net profit was not providing

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.940
us with all the necessary information.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.020
Let us see the last

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.700
circumstance that makes the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.560
net profit not tell us about

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.480
possible treasury problems.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.180
In this case, the net profit does not

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.480
reflect debt collection and debt

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.660
amortization payments.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.920
Let us go to the previous case, the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.440
case of the transport company.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.760
He also has a profit

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.360
of $200,000, but that

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.220
year he wins a long-

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.600
term loan worth $250,000.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.960
So, he was in a compromised

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.300
situation, as in the previous

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.220
case, with a negative cash

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.940
flow of $50,000 he had

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.220
to assume.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.660
In this case, the partners had

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.620
to increase capital and provide

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.780
an additional $50,000 to the

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.860
company that they had not

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.820
planned to do.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.200
In conclusion, what I would say

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.780
is that net profit is necessary.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.060
The company must have a

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.440
positive result or profit.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.060
It is a very important

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.940
part of cash flow.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.620
However, it is a magnitude that

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.960
is necessary, but it is not enough.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.380
Why is?

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.180
Why is it not enough?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.600
Because it doesn't take into account

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.120
the variables we've seen before.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.260
It doesn't take into account when

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.320
the collection and payments occur, it

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.140
doesn't take into account the investments

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.540
you have to make in fixed assets or

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.780
it doesn't take into account the

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.680
relationship with debt.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.560
Cash flow is a measure

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.100
that provides a wider

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.360
or more real perspective

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.620
on the company's situation.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.120
