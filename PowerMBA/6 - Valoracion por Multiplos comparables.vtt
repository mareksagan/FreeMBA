WEBVTT

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.930
We will learn to evaluate a

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.870
company using one of the most

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.430
common methods that are the comparable

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.530
multiple.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.010
What we will do very briefly is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.330
to analyze how much other companies

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.910
that are similar to ours are worth,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.430
because of our sector,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.790
in the same geographic

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.350
area, etc.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.990
We will get conclusions and we

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.030
will apply it to our company.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.950
We will then be able to look at the market.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310
What are the advantages of this?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.710
For example, if we compare it with

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.070
the discount of cash flows, to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.150
start with it is easier to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.090
do, it is easier to get information

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.430
from similar companies,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.270
etc., or from listed companies,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.310
than to do the projection

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.530
of cash flows, which is

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.610
more complex.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.690
It is a more objective assessment.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.510
That is, you won't be based on your hypotheses

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.290
on how much you're going to grow,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.650
on your opinions, no.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310
We will be based on data that is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.190
objective, which is, for example,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.910
by how much have sold companies

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.130
that are similar to ours, which

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.190
does not mean that it is

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.730
better.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.090
I say it is objective.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.110
The first thing you need to know is to

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.710
understand well what the concept of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.590
the multiple or the comparable multiple

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.630
consists of.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.270
Basically, the multiple what they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.490
do is to relate the value of the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.690
company, which can be the value

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.250
of the company or the value

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.710
of the equity, they relate

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.870
the valuation with some

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.450
of the main business indicators,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.890
such as sales, such as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.250
the levit, such as net

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.290
profit, etc.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.070
It is a relationship between the two.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.710
What we do is look at other companies,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.370
see how much they are worth and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.230
relate it to their sales or

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.290
avoid them, etc.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.990
As there are different indicators, there

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.710
are different multiple.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.210
A company can be valued based

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.410
on different multiple.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.670
Some are the most well-known.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.430
For example, the multiplier on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.410
sales, the multiplier on avoidance,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.790
the PER, which is the value

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.830
of the quote related to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830
the net profit, etc.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.790
We will leave you a listing on the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.930
additional resources and so that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.910
you understand well what we will

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.230
do is deepen into some of the most

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.370
well-known multiple.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.810
Let's start with the multiplier on sales.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.550
The formula is on the screen.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.130
What we do is to relate the value

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.990
of the company to the sales of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.710
that company.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.670
Imagine you have a pharmacy and you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850
want to sell it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.570
And it turns out that the multiple in

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.090
your sector is between 1.5 and 2 over sales.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.950
What is this meaning?

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.190
Well, what it means is that the value

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.190
of the company is equal to the sales,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.550
the sales of your pharmacy, multiplied

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.090
by that usual multiple

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.050
in the sector.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.870
We will apply it to ours.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.690
It turns out that you have a pharmacy

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.110
that bills a million euros and we

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.050
will apply the multiplier of 1.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.870
5 in the low range.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.250
The minimum value of the company

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.050
is 1.5 million.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.950
So of simple.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.890
Another common multiple

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.670
is the over-evita multiple.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.090
In this case, we do not start from

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.570
the sales above in the result

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.570
account, but we go to a magnitude

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.850
that is more representative

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.310
of the profit.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.270
What is the formula?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.650
Well, because the multiple over

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.550
avoids what it does is to relate the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.070
value of the company to the avoids.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.190
If we want to calculate what the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.490
value of our company is,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.470
we will have to multiply the avoid

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.050
by the multiple that is reasonable

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.950
in our sector.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.710
In this case, we will think that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.230
we have a shoe factory.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.470
And it turns out that companies

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.130
in our sector are being valued

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.350
and are selling in a multiple

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.290
of avoid by 7.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.030
Imagine, it's just an example,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.150
but it could be real.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.470
If it turns out that in our company

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.570
we have an annual avoidance of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.210
one million euros, well, because

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.510
we can already make the valuation

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.790
of our company.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.650
Using the multiple over

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.830
method, it results to be worth

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.290
7 million euros.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.090
Another well-known multiple, which

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.530
is very used when we talk about

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.090
listed companies, is the P.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.890
It may sound.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.530
It is the relationship between price,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.810
quote, in this case we talk about

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.290
the value of the own funds

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.950
or equity and net profit.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.690
Price-earning ratio of the project.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.850
If a company is being rated with

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.290
a 20, imagine, it means it's very

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.210
high, it means that the value of

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.390
your quotation is equal to your

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.430
annual net profit by 20, for

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.370
example.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.450
By the way, I want you to keep

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.470
in mind that multiple, as I said

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.330
before, can be applied to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.630
different magnitudes.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.450
And, in addition, good, because

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.770
it is that really within each sector

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.910
it makes sense to apply or use the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.070
magnitudes or others.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.190
And let's think, for example, that

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.310
we are in the internet sector,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.910
in the classified sector, imagine.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.670
All this is a supposition.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.350
It turns out that companies

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.830
in our sector, almost none

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.870
have, many have not yet been able

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.290
to monetize their users,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.570
will do so in the future, and in

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.550
addition, obviously, none has benefits.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.130
Companies must be valued in

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.810
some way.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.690
There is a value indicator that is

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.290
representative of the value of

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.750
the company.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.830
In this case, it could be, for

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.370
example, indicators such as the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.070
number of users or traffic, for example,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.150
it could be that it was done

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.270
many years ago.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.010
We use a multiple of

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.130
the number of users.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.650
We link the value of the company

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.090
with the number of users.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.490
And it turns out that in your industry

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.190
it is being evaluated, similar companies

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.230
have been evaluated to a multiple

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.550
of 10 on the number of users.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.130
In other words, each user is

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.710
considered to be worth 10.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.570
If you have a million users,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.090
your company would be worth 10

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.910
million euros.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.130
To finish, we will summarize

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.070
what steps we would have

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.750
to take if we want to evaluate

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.610
our company using the comparable

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.930
multiple.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.010
The first thing we need to do

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.510
is identify which companies

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.730
are comparable.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.650
We have to look at companies

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.590
from which we can draw conclusions

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.110
that make sense.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.010
Companies from our sector,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.450
from our same geographic

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.810
area that resemble us, etc.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.010
And by the way, there is a big distinction here.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.590
There is a distinction between

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.370
whether we are talking about listed

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.130
or unlisted companies.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.110
In fact, I sometimes say it because

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.150
you may see it separately as

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.690
if they were different

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.630
valuation methods.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.410
In the end, the multiple is

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.430
always used.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.890
The practice is very different

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.130
when we talk about

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.010
companies.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.510
Why is it?

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.110
Because the information is

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.630
accessible and what you are doing

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.610
is to compare the company's

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.090
quotation price at that time

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.810
with your business's indicators.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.650
However, when we talk about non-

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.750
listed companies, as we talked

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.830
about the case of the pharmacy,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.970
you obviously can't start from

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.690
the value of the quote or the

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.770
price of the quote at that time.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.390
What we have to do is fix ourselves

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.150
on transactions, in purchase

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.550
and sale operations, for example,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.890
that have been given previously.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.470
It's like buying a house.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.710
What you do is consider what

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.710
the purchase price has been

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.950
given in similar operations

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.330
near your home, for example.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.530
As I told you, it is different

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.630
methodology if we talk about

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.650
co-opted companies or non-cointended

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.070
companies, in which case

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.290
we fix on previous transactions.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.410
We know which companies

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.790
we need to look at.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.450
The following is to identify which

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.810
are the multiple that make the

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.110
most sense to value our company.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.290
And here you have to take into account

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:26.850
the following.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.670
In many cases, multiple

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.010
is conditioned by the

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.490
multiple that is used.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.330
If you use the multiple

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.930
over avoid, you will have to

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.350
consider the multiple over

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.110
avoid.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.990
What happens is that it is true

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.650
that from the concrete knowledge

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.770
of your business it is possible

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.410
that you can make certain nuances.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.230
For example, imagine, we will put

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.010
ourselves in the case that we

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.130
have a tax advice and it turns out

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.270
that in our sector the advice is

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.710
valued to a multiple, imagine,

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.590
of 1.5 survents.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.850
But it turns out that you have a much

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.530
higher margin of surplus sales than

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.890
your competitors.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.750
That is, if your advisory bills

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.850
two million, your profits are much

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.690
higher than the average of advisory

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.190
with the same invoice.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.950
In this case, if what we do is

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.570
to apply only the multiple

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.950
surplus, we are

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.110
undervaluing our company.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.690
So we would have to make certain adjustments,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.050
it has all the sense of

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.030
the world.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.890
Well, we already know what we are going

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.410
to fix on, we already know what

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.650
multiple we will use.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.250
What we do is analyze those data,

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.250
calculate the multiple, apply

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.630
them to our company and so we

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.670
will get the value of our company.
