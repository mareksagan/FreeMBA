00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.250
It seems clear that SEM is a

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.990
channel that has many advantages,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.850
and we talked about the immediate,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.470
few risks, performance and

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.910
others, but I would love to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.150
know all the companies that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450
want to opt within their mix of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.050
channels for SEM, what they

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.970
have to do or what they have

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.390
to take into account to do well.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.910
From the same Google AdWords

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.710
platform they have to generate their

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.830
campaigns.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.970
The first thing to do is

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.810
ask yourself what the keywords

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.490
are, the searches on which

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.490
I have to appear.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.630
There are three elements to choose from.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.830
The volume itself, because I have to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
be able to have a volume of searches.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.230
I am relevant.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.770
I can be a small neighborhood shoe shop

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.010
and be relevant for sports shoes,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.790
but if I am going to fight with

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.090
a Didas, a Nike or an Asos, for

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.490
example, because maybe I have to

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.490
look for other niches and see,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.510
take advantage of another way.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.510
The third is the cost

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.650
of the keywords.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.290
It's profitable, it'll be profitable

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.730
for me some time.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.570
You need to make some calculations

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.990
to get an idea.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.310
We have to choose.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.230
In the end, searches are words

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.450
that are introduced.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.070
Then we have to choose

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.610
which words we want

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.470
to appear in.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.910
At the end of the day, each

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.450
company has a different choice

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.350
of words.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.910
The stars are costume, measurements,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.410
stars, they can be different.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.690
There is one key point that

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.170
we always discuss with our customers.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.750
This is Pull Marketing,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.250
not Push Marketing.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.490
This means that we need to understand

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.370
what the target language of my users is.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.150
Then I can, as the CEO of my

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.470
company or marketing director

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.490
or marketing manager, have

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.170
an idea of what my super chulo

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.710
product is and what it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.170
is.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.030
But that's not why the user I'm

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.210
looking for will look for this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.370
product itself.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.990
So I have to do this exercise

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.350
that is sometimes a bit complicated,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.870
but really my users

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.850
look for it.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750
This is the first key of all

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.270
of the SEM.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.950
Yes, because you can name your

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.790
product in one way, but in the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.050
customer's mind the search is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.570
different.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.510
It is exactly this.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.830
And we have to keep in mind, when

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.190
we choose those words, we have

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.210
to keep in mind that there are

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.390
no competitors that are much

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.590
stronger, willing to pay

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.790
much more basically.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.150
Of course, in fact.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.350
We have already identified

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.330
what the keywords are.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.190
That is.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.610
Then we have to define the ads.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.010
As we said before, a text ad

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.410
is two lines of title of up

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.650
to 30 characters.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.250
You need to have a little writing

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.390
ability and a 80 description.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.490
Then this ad has to be credible,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.850
be consistent with the search

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.910
and give the user a wish to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.370
click.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.030
A lot of things in a few characters.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.770
And the fourth fundamental element

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.030
is where I send the tragic.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.770
Because I can send to my homepage,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.190
to the homepage, but if I am doing

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.350
a search for men's costumes

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.350
in Madrid, then I have my

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.830
category of men's costumes.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.270
I will have the courage to

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.730
send this.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.170
Why is?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.350
Because always maximize the relationship

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.510
and consistency between the search

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.970
that has been performed and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.310
the content, the response I am giving,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.710
which is a mixture between the ad

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.810
itself and where I direct traffic.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.910
It is not only that the advertisement

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.210
is very attractive.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.810
It is one of the parts.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.650
It is one of the parties.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.450
But you pinch and take you to something that

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.430
doesn't have excessive relationship and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.190
you say, this isn't.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.310
Not only will the user penalize

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.790
you, but the algorithm

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.950
itself, the Google or Bing

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.290
tool itself, will penalize you.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.610
And in the end, what will happen?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.750
You will pay more and more.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.670
Why is?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.810
The tool identifies

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050
these positive or negative

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.110
behaviors of users.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.890
and Genius.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.570
We have chosen keywords, we

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.810
have created our ads within

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.870
Google AdWords and now we

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.710
have to hire them.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.570
What else should we consider?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.090
It is that I have to define the pooh

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.550
up to how many euros or how many

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.530
cents I am willing to pay for each

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.950
click.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.410
This has to be defined for every

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.210
thing.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.030
So what does this poo influence?

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.710
It affects how many times I will

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.070
appear and it affects where

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.210
I will appear.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.930
First, second, third, fourth and so on.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.330
It's not the only element

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.610
to determine positioning because

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.670
as we talked before, the overall

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.970
charity of both the ad

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.770
and the ad landing page

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.070
also affect this.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.070
But it is one of the elements.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.070
That is, imagine, they give us

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.630
a range, we can pay for this to this.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.230
Or not, a recommendation.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.330
Google gives you a recommendation.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.790
And it's not me having more money, I'

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.070
m willing to pay more and I'm sure

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.590
to be the first.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.290
That's a criterion that Google

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.030
uses, that you pay more than

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.590
others, but what it says is

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.090
quality.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.610
actually is.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.410
There is something that is fundamental

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.930
in all this.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.210
The three elements we have

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.570
mentioned, keywords, ad and

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.610
auction, are dynamic elements

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.170
that if I have a new

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.930
ad idea I will be able

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.710
to try.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.630
If I have a new keyword idea,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.970
I will be able to configure

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.470
it and see what results

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.490
it will bring.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.430
And the auction is something I am going

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.130
up and down based on my results,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.170
where I come from, with respect

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.170
to my business plan, this

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.390
type of elements.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.470
And that's where we get into

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.430
a real professional management

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.470
Well, really what Google AdWords

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.210
allows us to manage it to permanently

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.590
optimize it because you

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.470
can play with the three levers.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.530
That's what I said, it's immediate.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.330
It is immediate.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.430
And there is an immediate effect to the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.510
game on these three levers.
