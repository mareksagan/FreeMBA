WEBVTT

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.500
Cris, we have already identified what

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980
we want, and it is also very interesting

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.900
the approach you have proposed

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.600
in which the key is attitude, it is

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.520
the multiplier, and you have to have

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.100
clear what attitude you want and attract

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.860
talent, attract people with that

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.800
attitude, and we will already

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.600
develop them and give them the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
knowledge they need.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.140
And now the next thing we have

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.560
to do is, I know what I want but

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.100
I have to look for it.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.460
First, where do we look for it?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.640
There are different

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.960
tools to find talent.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.820
These are job portals, such as

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.500
a job and talent, an info

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.020
jobs, a job today.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.080
How they work?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.660
Basically, you pay an annual

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.120
license and allow you to publish

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.320
offers and receive candidatures

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.160
and contact people who

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.960
have applied your license.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.880


00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380
The typical software

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.920
as a service plan you have...

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.480
Indeed, where you publish, well,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.960
they are like listings for if you

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.400
say, where you put the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.760
information in each of the fields.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.620
Information about the position,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.100
reports, salary levels and others,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.080
and then based on that you publish

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.240
and receive the CVs of all

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.320
the people who have applied

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.060
your candidacy for the position.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.820


00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.820
This is an instrument.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.260
Then there are the universities

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.700
or study centers, business

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.480
centers, which through employment

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
fairs and in their work bourses

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.480
can publish your positions

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.300
or your job offers.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280
That requires you to have direct contact

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.400
with those centers, right?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.160
actually is.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760
That is, you usually set

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.820
up a collaboration agreement

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.960
with a university or a study

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.480
center and then they

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.800
allow you to post job offers

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
on their job bourses

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.080
and then students or

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.020
college graduates apply

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.040
to your positions.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.800
That is another tool.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.000
Then there is another tool that are

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.920
headhunters.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.880
For very specific and high-level

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.240
positions, headhunters are used,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.820
which are of all kinds, they are

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.560
focused on the different industries,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.640
depending on the profile of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720
the job that is being sought

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.520
and so on.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.360
And they work for a purpose.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.240
There are people who work for success

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.320
and there are people who work for exclusivity.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.620
That would be the headhunters.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.220
And then there is a last tool that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.760
is basically internal

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.800
or spontaneous candidatures.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.060
The internal candidatures, logically,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.160
you do what you do is on your portal,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.920
in your intranet you publish that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.040
job offer and apply your

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.480
employees.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.880
And spontaneous candidatures are,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.460
in the company profiles you have

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.740
on LinkedIn or in people spontaneously,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.940
regardless of whether

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.020
you have posted an offer,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.900
because they send you their

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.160
resume or ask for certain

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.060
information.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.920
This is what companies that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.240
have worked well brand employee,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.420
employee value proposal,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.820
companies that are attractive

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.080
to people, receive spontaneous

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.240
candidatures, the rest

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.180
not.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.920
actually is.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.220
And probably the spontaneous candidatures

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.540
are the most interesting,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.340
because it is people who like your

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.660
values and who write you for that

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.840
and who have taken the initiative

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.760
to do so.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.980
That is.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.100
This is the traditional

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.440
way to manage it.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.080
How do innovative companies

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.960
manage it?

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060
We, in our case, at Pernod

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.220
Ricard, what we do is, we get out

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800
a little of this methodology

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.560
and, for example, we publish

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.040
our vacancies on social

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.460
networks and also do it in

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.540
an innovative way.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.020
Why is?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.320
We do not publish a vacancy.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.760
We have put them in place,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.660
so they do not know what will

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.360
happen.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.040
You know that there are probably

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.860
a number of jobs or a number

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.520
of scholarships in this

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.460
company.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.500
Then, we send them teasers

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.820
at the call level through social

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.340
media.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.880
Social media is not advertising.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.360
This is not the social network of...

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.420
We are not talking about LinkedIn.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.120
Yes, we use LinkedIn,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.540
we use Twitter, we use Facebook

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.240
and we use Instagram.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Do your followers see

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.380
you on social media?

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.280
That is, that is.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.600
They see our followers and then

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.260
the media impact you have is much greater,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.060
logically, because you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.900
go beyond the employment portals

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.800
and you know that you will receive

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.460
people who, as you do because you

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.540
like them, are people who are

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.380
probably very close to the level

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.840
of attitude and self-confidence.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.880
Not yet defined the position.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.360
You bring a lot of people who are

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.560
aligned with that attitude that you

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.540
defined to us before and bring them

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.900
to all and what do you do?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.500
What allows you to do so?

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.280
That is, logically, it allows you not to

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.120
be stressed, that is, it allows you

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.720
to continue focusing on the person and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.020
not on the position, right?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.980
Because you place them to have an experience

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.340
and what guarantees you is that the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.420
candidate will be comfortable and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.220
will have fun, because when people

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.500
are comfortable and have fun, they

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.340
give the best of themselves and you

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.380
there, logically, with the human

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.500
rest department that are the ones

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.740
we design the dynamics and everything

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.200
that will happen during that day,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.540
because there are many things and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.940
you are already fixing on

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.480
behaviors that candidates have,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.100
in attitudes, in certain

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.300
skills, but in a playful

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.980
environment and then it is not

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.720
an interview to use, that

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.120
then we will talk about the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.320
interview process, it is not

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.920
an interview use to, it is an

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.060
interview where people will have

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.760
fun is and at the time when

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.320
they give the best version

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.800
of themselves.
