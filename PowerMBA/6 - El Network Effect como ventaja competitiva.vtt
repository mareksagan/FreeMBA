00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.710
I will dare to review and evolve

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.890
one of the most well-known and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.810
most accepted models in business

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.530
strategy, which is Michael

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.110
Porter's generic strategy.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.590
What happens is that the so-

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.830
called model we have studied,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.010
because it really is excellent,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.410
is born in the mid-1980s and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.250
since then many things have

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.070
happened.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.070
And among other things, what has happened

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.730
is that platforms are revolutionizing

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430
absolutely almost every sector

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.450
and in fact, as we have seen,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.490
even the five largest companies

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.810
in the world in terms of business

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.950
capitalization are platforms.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.890


00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830
Let us consider the following.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.530
What is the competitive advantage of

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.130
the platform?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.310
We have to give a response within

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.970
the scheme of the generic

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.690
strategies.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.250
Is it cost leadership or is it differentiation?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.470
Let us think about it

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.830
with a concrete example.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.170
We have here the two leading real

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.550
estate portals in Spain, Fotocase

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.910
and Idealista.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.190
What they do is connect

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.070
the housing offer by owners,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.590
real estate agencies,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.230
promoters, etc. and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.330
demand, which are buyers

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.990
or tenants, purchase

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.910
and rent.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.990
So, what is the competitive

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.630
advantage in this sector?

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.650
What is it that he does?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.290
What is the factor that contributes

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.050
to one of the two, to that Fotocase

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.070
and Idealista grow one relative

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.050
to the other or that Fotocase and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.050
Idealista have grown more than the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.730
rest of portals with a lower quota?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.980
Or would you challenge me to give

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.180
me an explanation from the point

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.680
of view of Michael Porter's generic

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.400
strategies?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.240
Have you sought cost leadership or

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.720
have you sought differentiation?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.540
What is the key really?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.780
The key in a platform model is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.240
the network effect, the network

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.500
effect, the ability to connect,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.280
the volume of users

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.220
it has.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720
Really the competitive advantage

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.260
that Fotocase and Idealista have

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.860
over the rest of portals with a lower

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.180
share is not that they are

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000
cost leaders or that they offer

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.780
nothing different because the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.620
functionalities are

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.180
exactly the same in almost

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.700
all marketplaces of this type.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.520
The real competitive advantage is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.000
the volume of users, it is the network

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.520
effect they have generated that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.440
makes as we saw that they bring

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.840
much more value and generate

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.920
a huge barrier to entry.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.660
So I think we should review Michael

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.240
Porter's generic strategy model

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.880
since platforms are gaining

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.860
so much importance we

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.640
should review it and we should

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.000
incorporate a third source

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.660
of competitive advantage

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.980
that is the ability to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.620
connect, which is the network.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.440
And only so would we be able to answer

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.560
the question I have asked you in

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.120
a sector in which several marketplaces

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.780
or various platforms compete,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.900
what is the competitive

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.900
advantage?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.220
What makes some people grow

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.260
more than others?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.580
Until now we could not give the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.420
answer because it is neither

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.320
cost leadership nor differentiation,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.960
the true source of competitive

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.300
advantage in this case

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.580
is the ability to connect.
