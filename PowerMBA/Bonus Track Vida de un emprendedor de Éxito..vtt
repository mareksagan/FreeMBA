00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.020
Hugo, I would love if you told

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.320
us a little about your life story,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.860
how you started doing business,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.520
what companies you participated

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.140
in, what have been your greatest

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.580
successes, or what you are proud of.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.460
Well, starting a little with the process,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.720
my family, both my grandfather, both

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380
my other grandfather, my mother have

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.340
always been entrepreneurs,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.280
in one way or another, and that I think

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.620
I have lived it and I have been

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.260
able to keep it silent throughout

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.320
my life since I was a little boy.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.000
That was reflected, for example, when

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.240
I was in school and I was 13,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.700
that the truth that I only had

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000
were the 100 pessetas or 200 pessetas

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that I gave to take a snack, a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.880
bowl, because I decided I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.720
wanted to have something more

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.540
of money and do something

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.180
of business.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.060
So what I started doing was getting

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.100
silk worms to sell them to

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.460
all my classmates, college-

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.400
mates and so on, and it was

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.960
a pretty profitable business

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.560
and it didn't bring me

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.780
much trouble.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.560
At the beginning of that,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.980
already at college, well, we did

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.480
some business and so, any, and then

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.600
at the university I met Felix and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.000
then, a friend of Felix had the idea

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.380
of creating Twenty, and there I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.880
could be involved, I could

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.180
be a partner, then what happens

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.160
is that, one way or another, I

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.120
decided to go to London to finish

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.240
my studies and I wasn't working

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.900
at Twenty as such.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.100
That's what brought me a little into

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.960
the world of entering the world

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.740
of startups.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.220
Then we created a copycat of Groupon,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.680
which at that time, in 2009, was something

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.520
of super-media and an incredible success

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.280
in the United States, we decided to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.380
create it with the perfect timing

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.080
and with the leverage of Twenty,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.820
and the reality is that when

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.400
we launched it was an impressive

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.720
success, we had a team, theoretically,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.260
pretty good, and as a project

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.840
that is created in the perfect timing

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.060
with, supposedly, the right

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.820
people, does not triumph for

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.040
series of sizes.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.500
I like to say that because, at the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.080
end of the day, everyone believes that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.240
here everyone is successful and behind

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.340
successes there are always failures.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.060
That was one of our

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.160
failures.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.800
I think you sold the first day.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.860
Well, in fact, the first day we launched,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.780
I think they sold, I don't remember

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.780
if they were, like 4,000 or

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.800
5,000 cards cards of Carlos Sainz,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.260
I don't know if it was an approximate

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.220
turnover of 90,000 euros, launch,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.180
we believe that, look, that was

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.440
one of the releases we said,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.080
this will be a much bigger success

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.520
than Twenty, and then, as in

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.620
the end, not surrounding yourself

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.280
with the best of such a professional

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.720
team, or maybe not going to risk

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.900
with greater strength, for not

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.720
having created a powerful sales

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.800
team, how can an idea that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.200
is launched with success roughly

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.840
and that we ended up buying

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.200
Ferum, but for a non-

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.280
relevant amount.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.530
In which provinces

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.490
did you participate?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.790
Then, later, I went to New York,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.170
and New York what did me, is

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.450
that I went to work on a

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.510
backdrop in a time of crisis,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.550
a time in which New York was

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.790
not easy for me, but that made

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.810
me completely change the mentality

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.690
I had, more Spanish,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.370
less risks, more quiet, of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.270
thinking smaller, in

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.170
the little bit, and made

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.670
me think very big.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.490
I thought, I met a lot of people

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.970
that I went to find there in the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.890
life of New York, and I understood

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.290
that it is the same to create

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.410
a restaurant that you may probably

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.890
have to be in that restaurant

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.590
15 hours a day, that you may

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.770
think big, and instead of

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.630
creating a restaurant, because

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.330
the timing you will devote to

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.750
that business will be the same,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.250
because at the end the time

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.490
is limited, they will be 12, 15,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.990
20 hours a day, which are, but

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.970
you don't have more, and what

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.070
you will have to do

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.570
is surround yourself with an

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.730
amazing team, knowing to delegate,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.650
which is super important,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.810
and above all that is one thing

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.130
that I want to nuanced, is

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.770
that people believe, when

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.530
a business model sees, joder,

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.570
that's how he has done,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.090
that's he knows everything,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.350
he doesn't know everything,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.150
he doesn't know everything,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.450
he knows what'

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.950
Then apart from that, then I started

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.170
to be curious about going back

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.650
to work on my own, I saw that New

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.750
York was a good place to do so,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.070
but there were complications as

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.770
well, because in the end it wasn't

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.430
my native country, and in the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.050
end it needed much more money than

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.370
in Spain.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.170
Then, finally, I thought,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.810
to begin with, as I was within the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.210
Internet ecosystem, I decided

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.330
to set up a strategic consultancy

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.830
for public financing, they were

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.010
times in which the start-

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.910
ups found no funding, neither

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.510
funds, nor people, nor

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.070
Friends and Family, nor, of course,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.370
banks, because it was a

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.810
time of crisis, people did

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.470
not want to invest, I was afraid,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.790
and it was a time in which,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.950
in Spain, there were many

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.630
public aid with very good

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.090
conditions that could apply

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.870
companies of new creation,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.710
and I decided to

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.770
set up that and come

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.670
to Spain.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.630
It was a tough time, because my heart

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.930
wanted to be in New York, in that

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.610
city I dreamed of since I was a kid,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.070
from the day I saw the movie Solo

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.330
at Home, in fact, I told my

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.690
mother, I am going to live there

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.210
and I am going to succeed

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.030
there, my mother laughs, I would

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.190
have nine years, I actually lived,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.170
I don't know if I succeeded, but

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.090
at least what I am, is what came

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.870
after New York, it has been something

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.730
incredible for me.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.870
I mounted the consultant and say

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.150
the strategic consultant, because,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.290
in the end, people what they always

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.870
want and intend is to have the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.290
business model, the best idea, is

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.690
that, of course, you had that best

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.730
idea, there is no better idea, there

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.770
is no better idea, what there

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.890
is is a very persistent execution,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.850
very day-to-day, very constant, surround

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.890
yourself very well with the right

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.370
people, follow and follow, because

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.070
most of the we know as such,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.010
as can be Amazon, as can be Airbnb,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.570
as can be many, have pivoted,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.090
that is, Amazon started being

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.570
an online bookstore, and

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.430
now, what is it?

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.690
Would anyone describe it as

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.690
an online bookstore?

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.750
Or would you describe it as an English

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.290
cut online?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.210
Or is it going far beyond that?

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.010
I came, I created the company,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.510
thank God, I had to move a lot, I

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.490
had to get millions, talk to

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.570
millions of entrepreneurs

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.110
who were starting with lots

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.590
of desire, but disappointed because

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.670
they didn't find funding,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.290
in the end, I managed to

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.950
create an ecosystem, I managed

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.690
to finance approximately more

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.590
than 100 million euros in companies

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.370
through public aid and public

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.430
financing, and that's what

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.030
made me get back to illusion

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.470
and to start again

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.190
and start again.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.950
As a result, with all those companies

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.390
I knew, I started investing with

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.950
what I was billing in the company,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.670
I managed to invest in Cabify, a

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.430
company of great success, in which

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.830
it has been a clear example of execution,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.270
because it has a much larger

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.670
competitor than he, which is

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.670
Uber, and has managed, with a clear

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.210
competitive advantage, giving

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.030
a great service, to create a gap

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.670
in Latin America, in Spain, obviously,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.770
is a leading company, but

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.550
in Latin America, for example,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.710
is the second in most countries,

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.010
but grows month by month,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.350
above a 30%, as far as

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.470
GMB, as regards revenue.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.970
I also went to a

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.610
marketplace, why?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.490
because I loved to know that

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.890
immediate is what is looking for

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.990
any user, who was Globo, invited

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.390
us the founder and...

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.610
I'm going to tell you because this

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.250
is curious, I think they were

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.350
calling me and I think it's

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.340
a Globe distributor.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.040
No, we are going to follow.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.260
A clear example of this is

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.920
that you clearly give a service

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.920
we need, you are now working,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.680
we are here right now, you

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.340
don't have time to get the

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.680
thing you've asked for and

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.880
you have it here only with,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.000
say, a click on the mobile.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.180
Then, also, obviously, a very nice

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.460
story that I had, parallel,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.520
when I saw in New York, Joppan Talent

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.960
was in trouble in 2012, it is

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.760
a company that has pivoted

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.060
a lot of model, and in 2012 I

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.580
decided, not for the business

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.220
model of that day, but for the

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.420
team that there was at Joppan

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.600
Talent, I decided to help them

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.400
go ahead.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.140
That I did in a way, let's

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.200
say, strategic, vision, and

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.280
also achieving...

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.640
Basically, the money was

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.200
lost, what happens is that

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.820
for me there is no money lost

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.920
if you trust the people behind

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.260
them, they had a lot of illusion,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.560
they still have a lot of

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.220
passion, which is something

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.620
fundamental to take your

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.100
project forward.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.160
Finally, it was able to make a

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.440
relatively beautiful story with many

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.680
problems on the way, and for me

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.360
it has been one of the companies

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.420
that has most marked me at that

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.920
stage, because it is what made

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.000
me live and feel that any critical

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.880
situation of any company,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880
no matter how much it has, can

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.540
come forward and can be a

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.140
rotating success story.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.240
I went on, I got involved in De Port

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.160
Village, I am in the board, I

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.220
also invested in that company, it

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.800
is a company, a vertical sports

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.380
company, it is a company that is

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.540
virtually the second, third company

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.600
in southern Europe, Spain, France,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.120
Italy and Spain, it is a company

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.080
that grows above 80% year-

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.620
on-year, and it is a company of

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.920
great success for Spain, it is

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.640
an e-commerce.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.460
And finally came my challenge, one of

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.780
the most important in my life, that

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.800
was, we were, Felix and I, in fact,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.980
on vacation, on the beach, and we were

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.380
thinking what company, he is President

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.000
at Joe Pantale, and what company

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.160
we could involve, and I involved

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.000
in the operative of the company,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.780
that it was very good company

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.300
in Spain, or that we liked

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.880
very much, with a lot of potential,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.660
and that it had something

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.540
special.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.580
And finally we believed that Hawkers

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.960
was a very special company, very difficult

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.400
to enter, because we didn't

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.400
know the companies involved,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.760
we finally managed to have a relationship

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.280
and a bond of union, and we decided

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.100
to do a great operation with Hawkers,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.280
raise all the capital of a large

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.660
Spanish round, for, above all,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.880
we wanted to give a blow to

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.420
the table in Spain, and say that

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.160
in Spain you can do operations

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.180
at the level of the United States,

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.380
we return to that thanks to my

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.740
stage in New York, I could think

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.500
big, and that not only could you

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.740
do small things in Spain,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.640
I am involved in the operative

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.900
of Hawkers, and it's a

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.280
wonderful adventure

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.340
Hawkers, which I'll tell later

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.560
in more detail.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.580
You have said before that it is impossible

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.340
to have only successes, and you have

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.440
given an example, but the reality

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.900
is that you have demonstrated

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.140
an exceptional orphanage, because projects

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.640
that triumph over projects that

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.980
fail, there are very few, and you

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.600
have had the luck, but not luck

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.240
probably, to give with several

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.900
of the great successes.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.020
So I would like it very much, I think

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.100
it is very enriching, if you told

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.700
us what you are looking at, how you

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.160
analyze a company, what you are looking

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.120
at, whether they are metric people,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.200
I don't know, to invest or not

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.980
to invest.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.740
Well, depending on the stage of the business,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.800
I fix myself on some variables or other,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.100
that is, in a company that you

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.120
will be mounting from the start, obviously

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.000
there are no metrics, I fix myself

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.680
if there is capacity for the market,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.340
so that it is a big business,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.620
then, on the other hand,

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.760
I fixed a lot...

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.120
I'm going to take a look, right?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.820
The size of the market.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.200
The size of the market is fundamental,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.320
at least for me, and that's what

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.400
I need to know if so.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.990
Second, the idea, the business you

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.830
want to build, is creating real

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.990
added value, that is, is there a

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.710
real competitive advantage?

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.150
That is, there are some shortcomings

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.630
in that sector, in which you want to

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.030
mount it, that you can cover by

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.730
doing it better, with many fewer resources

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.010
than your competitors, because

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.810
they are much bigger, yes or no?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.630
If the answer is yes at that

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.690
moment, it is when what I do is try

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.830
to surround myself with the best

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.250
team, the best team, and in the

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.230
end that choice is what will mark

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.750
your company.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.110
Then there is another

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.070
important thing, which I always

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.410
ask, is timing.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.490
I will give you a simple example so that

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.510
you can see it clearly.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.850
If you understand that instead of

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.010
having been mounted in 2004, when Facebook

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.230
had not yet arrived in Spain, if it

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.290
had been mounted in 2008, I don't know

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.270
it scientifically, but I can assure

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.010
you that probably, in

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.670
a very high percentage, it would

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.130
not have been successful.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.790
Timing is also important.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.790
I love it, because you have said

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.390
four factors that are key, market

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.430
size, value creation, because

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.270
there is a problem that has not

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.070
yet been solved, and in addition,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.410
not only that it resolves a

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.570
problem, but also that it resolves

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.210
a problem with certain competitive

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.550
advantages, in a more efficient

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.690
way than current solutions

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.990
or whatever.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.410
We said team, the third leg,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.990
and the fourth you said timing.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.070
I think it is a good summary of

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.130
the four factors to analyze for...

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.970
So that's what in a first stage,

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.510
sit or create, is a bit of what

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.430
I look at or what I want to do,

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.530
if I run it from the investor

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.170
side, if I'm going to invest.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.030
And then, from the more growth

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.970
part, let's say I look at those four

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.770
variables, and then I would add a more

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.530
quantitative part, which would

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.670
be, say, metrics, KPIs and so on.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.590
And as for KPIs metrics, if you tell

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.570
me which are the most relevant,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.410
it depends a lot on which

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.390
sector we are in.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.790
For example, if we are in a marketplace,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.370
because the cohorts is something

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.310
that fixed me very much, the cohorts,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.430
then I fixed very much on the repetition

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.070
ratio, because at the end of the

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.990
day, today it is very well that

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.950
many companies that what they

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.730
do is a lot of investment in marketing,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.430
you have a few metrics, for

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.890
example, of downloads very

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.850
large, but then your product

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.950
is not used.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.810
So what does that mean?

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.970
It is worth nothing.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.270
They just try it, try it and it doesn't

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.170
work.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.330
Example of companies in which

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.410
it has large metrics, having

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.590
compared with many of the same

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.590
sector or different marketplace,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.830
has a very large recurrence

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.670
rate, or Lobo has a very

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.270
large recurrence rate.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.830
From village, as it is an

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.390
e-commerce, for example, I fix more

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.030
on the lifetime value, how

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.250
much I cost to buy, acquire a user,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.710
and in lifetime value, how much

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.610
at the end I am getting out.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.190
It depends very much on

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.890
repetition, and it always depends

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.230
on the creation of user value.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.410
Of the repetition, or also in this

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.870
case it may be that the purchase is

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.330
very high.

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:08.830
No is?

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.950
Then, for example, depending

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.430
on the sectors, you fix yourself more

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.670
in all that has talked to you, if

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.130
then we are in front of a new disruptive

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.290
idea that really does not

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.370
exist in the market, that is, you did

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.810
not have it in Spain, it is true

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.250
that there were events in the past

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.150
that were badly executed, or

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.770
that it really did not fill the

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.990
needs of the user, such as

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.770
high five, etc., because you fix yourself

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.990
a little more in your intuition.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.310
In your intuition, if you really

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.530
believe that there will be a space

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.330
for that product, if you really

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.610
like people, and I tell you that

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.790
it can be a smell, it can be

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.730
more intuition, it can be a

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.290
need that I see, try to see

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.350
it for the mass of people, etc.,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.390
but there is little more

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.510
you can see.
