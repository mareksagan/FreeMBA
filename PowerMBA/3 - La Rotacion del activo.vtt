00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.970
Today we will learn how to analyze

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.050
a company from the perspective

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.950
of asset rotation.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.430
I think it is very enriching because

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.830
it will help us understand a lot

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.490
of things.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.110
The rotation is very much related

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.430
to the volume of investment that

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.550
we have to make, it is very

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.770
related to profitability.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.010
We will see.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.990
What is the rotating of the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.810
asset?

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.410
It is the number of times throughout

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.230
the year or period that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.530
we consider that asset, that

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.870
investment we have made,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.750
becomes sales.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.950
Does it have a significant

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.130
impact on profitability?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.970
Think so.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.010
We have two companies that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.190
we have invested in.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.350
The asset is the same amount.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.210
The one with a higher rotation will

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.410
generate more sales.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.170
The profitability will be greater.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.830
Let us think of it differently.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.090
As we compare two companies,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.570
one has a larger rotation than

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.270
the other.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.150
In the case of a higher turnover of

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.730
the asset, the investment we will

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.430
have to make is lower.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.950
In any case, the profitability

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.150
will be higher.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.430
Why is it interesting to measure

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.750
the rotation of the asset, as well

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.510
as because it has a huge

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.890
impact on profitability?

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.410
Because it allows us to

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.010
draw conclusions about how the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.150
managers of the company are

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.130
using, whether they are using more

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.270
efficiently or not, the investments

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.730
they have made.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.850
It is an indicator of how

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.270
the company is managed.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.430
Now let's see how we can calculate

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.570
the rotation of assets.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.390
Always look at financial

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.110
statements.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.130
We need to go to the financial

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.530
statements to get the information.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.640
Now, back to the situation balance.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.580
Remember, in the balance sheet,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.700
in the block on the left,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940
it tells us where we have invested,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040
what are the assets

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.240
we have.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.960
And within the balance sheet

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.240
we have assets that are non-

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.520
current assets, which are immobilized,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.240
and we have current assets, which

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.540
are assets that have a higher liquidity

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.100
and that will become treasury

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.960
in a period of less than one

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.560
year.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.480
We can calculate rotation

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.680
in many ways, but I propose

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.860
two mainly.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.000
What we can do is calculate the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.320
rotation of the entire asset.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.740
And how do we do it?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.280
very simple though.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.620
What we do is divide the total

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.740
sales of a year, for example,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500
between the total asset.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980
What does this ratio tell us?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.360
It tells us about the number of times

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.300
over a year that the asset is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.680
converted into sales.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.600
Imagine that we have a gym and we

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920
have an asset of one million

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.380
euros.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.240
Sales are one million euros.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.800
The rotation is equal to one.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.100
It is just an example.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.840
Also what we can do is, instead

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.560
of considering the total asset,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.480
we can calculate the rotation

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.980
of stocks.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.280
Remember that inventories, inventories,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.080
are the part within the current

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.920
asset that is most related

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.900
to the production process.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.460
This is the game that should

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.040
be continuously rotating.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.520
How will we calculate the rotation

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.580
of stocks?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.640
For what we do is divide, in this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.560
case, instead of dividing sales

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.200
on the numerator, what we

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.700
will do is calculate or

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.940
consider the cost of

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.100
the goods sold.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.460
Not at the price we sell

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.660
it, but at the price we

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.700
have it accounted for.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.640
And in the denominator we

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.440
will not divide the total

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.460
of the asset, what we will

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.100
do is divide only between

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.460
the stock or inventory.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.340
What will this inform us?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.660
For the same as before, it will

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.380
inform us over a year how many

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.500
times they have rotated, what

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.760
is the speed with

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.700
which we get those stocks

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.060
to become sales, they will

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.820
generate us income.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.900
And here the question is, when is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780
it meaningful to use one ratio and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.220
when is it meaningful to use another?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.760
And for this there is no objective

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.160
answer, but I want you to understand

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.760
that we could mainly

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.720
classify industries,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.220
sectors or business

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.700
models into two.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.360
Although things are not white and black,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.240
but you have to understand the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.520
concept.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.180
We could in one extreme classify

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.860
business models that require

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.380
high investments in immovable.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.460
By the way, I want to incorporate a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.880
concept here that is CAPEX, which is

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.400
Capital Spenditure, which you have to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.640
know because it is very common.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.060
We'll think of industries that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.740
require high investments in immovable.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.120
That is, that of the total of

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.960
its assets a large part is immobilized.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.920
Almost all are non-current active.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.920
And they are also industries

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.060
that usually have huge

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.340
assets.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.220
For example, a shipyard

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.440
or a nuclear cell or a nightclub.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.420
And now let's think of

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.280
different industries in which if

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.540
we analyze the asset

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.360
mainly its asset will be current

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.300
assets.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.220
Current assets and usually

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.900
mainly stocks.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.140
We can think of business as a

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.780
cellar in which it has a huge

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.980
amount of inventory that is wine

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.760
during the production process.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.940
We can think of commercial

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.340
business of buying-selling goods.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.280
You can think of a food store.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.140
You can think of a jewelry, for example.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.260
I am sure many of you come to mind.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.200
Well, because in where a large

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.120
part of the asset is non-current

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.500
assets, CAPEX, I think it makes

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.660
more sense to directly

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.340
calculate the rotation

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.820
of the total asset.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.140
Because the rotation of

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.220
stocks in these cases is less

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.340
representative.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.660
And if we think of the that mainly

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.400
the investment is OPEX, current

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.900
assets, stocks, it would

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.440
make sense to calculate the

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.020
rotation of the entire asset

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.660
but we cannot lose the perspective

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.000
of the rotation of stocks

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.860
because it is absolutely

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.180
determining.
