00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.370
To understand branding, to understand

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.950
branding, we have to understand

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.070
a number of concepts.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.330
We have understood the positioning and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.070
there is another concept that I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.470
think is very important that

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.010
Power Envié students understand.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.450
It is elasticity.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.550
Then you would be grateful if you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
explained what elasticity is and also

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.370
if you put us some example

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.490
to understand it better.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.910
In a very simple way, elasticity

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.970
is how far you can stretch

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.730
your brand.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.270
And once you have chosen a

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.450
brand positioning, that positioning

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.250
determines in part the capacity

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.290
of extension, the capacity

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.130
of growth of that brand.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.190
I would say that it is the customers

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.350
who give you permission

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.670
to stretch your brand or not.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.730
If you want, let’s give you an example.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.090
An example of a job we do

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.430
on your day, for example, for

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.570
Taurus.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.090
A small appliance

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.310
that decided to jump

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.430
to the category of large

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.710
appliance.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.070
Then buy Neupol.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.550
But what you actually buy is the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.150
factory, the processes, but not

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.730
the brand.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.170
Because he says, no, it’s that I already

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.610
have the brand, that I’m Taurus.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.170
Then when you do market

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.270
research you realize that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.270
the customer didn’t give

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.390
you permission to jump.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.190
And for Taurus, let’s say he didn’t allow

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.770
him to sell washing machines, for example.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.770
I remember talking to the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.090
then CEO and saying, well,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.650
but this is like Volvo suddenly

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.930
sells motorcycles.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.150
Then I’m going to believe that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.710
Volvo can sell motorcycles.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.250
And I told him, of course, but it’s that

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.550
you’re not Volvo, you’re Derby.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.910
And Derby that will sell cars

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.690
will have it very difficult.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.030
Volvo will have it complicated

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.670
because it is associated with

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.090
cars, with cars, not so much with

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730
motorcycles.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.410
But whoever will have it much more complicated

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.610
is Derby because you have to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.770
climb a ladder.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.530
It wasn’t very good, honestly.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.470
It is an example of if you are

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.910
a small appliance, if you have

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.430
moved a trusted image,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.130
of robustness around the small

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.930
appliance, you have

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.810
to do a very, very important exercise

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.850
so that it is to be credible

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.250
and reliable within

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.430
that leap to the you want

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.030
to give.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.690
Sometimes it’s the brand in the sense of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.210
how they understand them.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.810
And when I say them, I mean the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.890
customers, that brand.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.170
Sometimes it is the name that determines

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.250
you.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.470
Telepizza is a beautiful name.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.870
Pizza and phone.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750
Your name determines how

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.510
far you can stretch your brand.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.750
You can’t sell as they are, I

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.450
don’t know if they still

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.650
do, but they introduced the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.410
hamburger a while ago.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.210
The hamburger is not telepizza because

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.530
then you would have to call

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.430
yourself differently.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.970
You are in a certain inconsistency.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.170
Your brand cannot stretch toward

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.730
certain products that are

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.190
pizza substitute.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170
You can introduce accompanying

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.530
items, but you can’t replace

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.730
pizza with hamburger.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.990
Another brand, maybe.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.730
The most common concept is

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.570
fast food.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.570
You are not fast food, you are

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.050
pizza.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.070
You are just pizza.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.890
Brand elasticity is very much

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.510
related, on the one hand, to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.610
brand positioning and on the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.850
other, to brand architecture.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.710


00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.690
If I want to sell hamburgers and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.970
compete with myself, I create

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.750
a brand.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.630
A brand that competes with

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.030
Burger King or McDonald’s.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.530
McDonald’s could

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.050
sell other things.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.490
Burger King can’t sell more

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.390
than hamburgers.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.110
So, is it a correct exercise

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.490
of brand architecture and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.590
market segmentation?

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.010
by Inditex.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.510
Different brands, for different

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.550
audiences, with different

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.470
styles, with different prices.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.850
I have Massimo Dutti, I have Pull &

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.970
Bear, I have Stradivarius, I have Zara.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.590
This will allow you to have more elasticity.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.210
of course.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.650
Why is?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.310
Because I can’t reach

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.010
a specific target audience.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.750
And so I can’t stretch the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.650
brand beyond what my

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.070
own brand positioning allows

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.490
me.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.030
And so, to solve those needs

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.230
that are different from

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.510
a particular target audience, I

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.770
have another brand, which is Massimo

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.470
Dutti.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.610
This is really a corporate

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.490
strategy.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.490
That is, if my brand is not elastic,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.790
instead of trying to stretch

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.110
it to failure, as the case that

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.250
Studio Taurus said, I use another

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.430
brand or create another brand.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.930
Another brand that wanted to stretch too much.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.630
I would have found the hole.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.330
All drinks and refresks

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.050
are gas.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.850
I am throwing trinitrotoluenes without bubbles.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.930
And I associate myself with the no-bubble concept?

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.370
What is happening?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.750
What do you say?

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.550
Why can’t I throw trinitrotoluenes

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.770
with bubbles?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.370
Then they threw trinitrotoluenes with bubbles.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.790
Of course, your brand concept, your

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.390
positioning had been the sin.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.450
Now you throw it.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.350
I’m going to launch another brand.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.430
But trine with bubbles doesn’t work.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.130
and Chirr.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.870
It costs.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.770
It is more difficult.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.310
This does not mean that you cannot sell.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.830
There will be people who will

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.950
buy your product.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.930
You are experiencing a lack of consistency.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.170
Within the land of no bubbles

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.370
you would have much more traveled.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.230
By entering with bubbles, you

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.890
start to deform your essence,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.870
your positioning.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.910
What your opportunity meant.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.530
and thanks!
