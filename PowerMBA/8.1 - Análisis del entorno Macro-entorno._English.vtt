00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.250
If we do a PES analysis, what factors

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.210
affect you?, because many factors

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.450
are affected.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.050
Political factors are

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.110
very important.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.610
Now, recently there has been a strike

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.650
in Bangladesh that concentrates a large

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.890
volume of production, because

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.050
you are obviously delayed in shipments

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070
and as the times are adjusted

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.830
in Fast Fashion, you can get without

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.050
stock of some very relevant models

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.510
that then on the other hand

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.230
you will have to discount

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.330
if you have enough.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.390
Political factors are very

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.010
important.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.470
If you remember, a few years ago there

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.930
was a political crisis for some

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.950
aircraft between Russia and Turkey,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.850
as they began to put barriers

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.530
to the import of products produced

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.930
in Turkey, which is a large

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.490
producer.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.110
Countries like Iran, for example,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.690
are restricting the volume you can

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270
sell inside the country that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.470
has not been produced in Iran,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.410
so you have to produce a portion

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.150
there.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450
China, for example, requires

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.130
different chemical analyses,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.970
which makes you have to do relatively

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.530
different processes to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.690
sell there, because if

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.770
you can’t sell it there.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.270
I have understood that the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.150
adaptations of the product to

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.170
export, having to meet the different

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.450
local regulations requires

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.670
an increase in costs.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.950
Yes, but it’s a well-used cost.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.610
In the end, what can’t be allowed

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.310
at the industry level is that humanitarian

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.750
tragedies happen like they

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.850
have happened in the past

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.130
or that people work in awful

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.210
conditions.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.550
And that’s why there are huge

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.890
efforts in terms of quality inspectors

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.210
of factories, although it’s a challenge

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.170
because we’re talking about huge extension

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.410
of terrain, we’re talking about

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.610
thousands of suppliers, multiplies

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.630
each supplier by n factories

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.150
and it’s very difficult for

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.550
the trace to be absolute.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.910
It’s a cost, but it’s

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.870
a cost that benefits

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.450
us all.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.430
Not to mention the part that

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.790
can affect in a more direct

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.070
way, such as the subject

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.510
of chemicals, in children’s clothing,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.550
for example.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.930
There are many lines of clothing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.910
for children that need to be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.750
taken care of, for example, in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.350
the chemical part, but also in

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.030
the sewing of the buttons or

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.530
even in the shirts that can

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.930
not harm a baby who is in a certain

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.310
position for a long time.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.910
I was told as an anecdote a shoe

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.270
manufacturer belonging to a large

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.450
group told me that almost the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.490
shoes are pants, that almost children

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.290
can eat them.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.270
We’re at a point where it would

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.870
be even edible, it’s an exaggeration,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.430
isn’t it?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.030
Well, it’s an exaggeration, but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.990
of course what they can’t carry

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.150
are chemicals that produce

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.410
them no adverse reactions.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.410
And this is very important because

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.610
children are children and don’t know

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.790
what they are doing many times.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.750
And yes, they are restrictions, but

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.650
they are taken, it must be done and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.790
the industry must continue to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.730
work in that direction.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.410
Political factors, of course, are

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.450
affected, we have seen.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.010
Economic factors, I imagine that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.090
the economic context of the different

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.890
countries affects a great deal.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.910
The economic context affects, I would

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910
say there is an economic part, the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.610
debate is very broad, but it is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.510
obvious that you have an economic

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.650
part that has to do, for example,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.390
growths, are very different

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.610
by geographical areas.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.710
The Asia-Pacific area at retail,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.610
apparel and accessories level grows

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.610
approximately 9-10% per year,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.110
while traditional Europe

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.150
is around 1-2%, this without

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.290
deducting inflation,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.390
with which it is quite

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.650
flat.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.750
In fact, it is very dependent

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.750
on consumption.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.150
But then there are other concepts that

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.290
have to do more with consumption

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.630
habits.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.370
There are studies that are done,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.610
which some consultants do on consumption

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.870
habits, for example, a few

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.510
years ago, which still lasts,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.570
a lot was spoken of the concept

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.870
of cocooning.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.430
of?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.270
Cocooning, because people were deriving

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.810
their share of wallet, the amount

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.330
of money they spent, to things

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.650
that are done at home.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.730
In fact, the decoration of the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.910
house was greatly improved.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.030
Ten or twenty years ago, we didn’

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.310
t take as much of the money

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.990
as the consumer, when today it’

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.090
s much more relevant.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.030
This part of being more at home,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.830
the theme of video platforms

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.090
where you can be more at home

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.310
watching a series.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.010
Interestingly, in the end, all of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.010
us, all of the consumers,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.350
all the companies compete to take

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.130
a significant part of the net

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.970
wage of a worker.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.950
Something goes in food, that there is a

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.790
tendency to warm and very clandestine,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.590
for example, another in clothing,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.130
etc.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.090
So cocooning is something that in

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.670
principle’t come well in fashion,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.850
except for a rather logical

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.390
trend, which is that many pyjamas,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.590
many clothes of this style, were

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.090
started to be sold.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.410
There are habits that change

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.790
people.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.830
Of course, it is the social factor,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.990
for example, clearly, the social factor.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.150
Another is sport.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.030
That was going to tell you, because

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.690
I have seen that in some of the chains

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.910
there has been a lot of enhancement,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.230
within the stores, the sports

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.890
clothing, which almost resembles these

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.830
specialized stores.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.130
Yes, in fact, there are two cases

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.430
of a very big bet, because there

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.610
are many chains such as, for example,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.150
H & M, which have quite relevant

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.270
sportswear, etc.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.150
But, for example, GAP, GAP has

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.550
created a concept that is sold

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.490
fundamentally in the United

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.330
States, I think they already

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.690
have stores in America, which is

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.810
called Atleta, which is a store,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.610
and it is also very curious, because

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.670
it is a sports store specialized

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.210
in women, which is a very nice bet,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.850
because they have realized that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.930
women have begun to do sports

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.690
much more in recent years, and

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.370
that they were not well served,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.950
and they were not so well served

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.970
by traditional brands

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.130
like Nike or other perspective.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.950
And it is a brand of its own, with a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.250
store of its own, that is, it is not

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.530
a multinational, you don’t have a hand,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.230
like in the case of H & M, that you would

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.870
have a man, woman, etc., accessory, linen,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.750
etc., but it is a bet of your own.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.390
And then there are stores that

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.290
are going very successful, the clearest

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.310
case is Lululemon, which I think

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.230
is Canadian, if I don’t remember wrong,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.590
that is sports stores, it is also very

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.890
female, for example, work

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.130
a lot the part of yoga, but, let’

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.110
s say, quite luxurious, we talk

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.370
about quite high prices, of

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.530
a sweater of 120 euros, 80 euros,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.250
that order of magnitude, and

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.110
have had a bestial success,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.730
a fantastic success.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.470
And then, let’s say that GAP, the

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.710
athlete concept is this, but a little

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.490
more low cost.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.110
And finally, what are the technological

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.610
factors that affect them?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.410
I imagine there is some technology

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.770
in the point of sale, in addition

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.130
to the digital channel.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.990
The technology, then...

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.550
Here the biggest challenge is to be able

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.670
to integrate the traditional

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.330
retail part with technology, that

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.130
is, to offer what is much spoken

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.370
of omnicanality.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.870
And that experience that is the same

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.190
on all channels is very difficult,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.750
a lot of effort is being made

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.590
to make it so, and it’s where

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.270
all brands are investing in

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.950
a fairly relevant way.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.090
For example, you can make an interaction

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.890
between buying something online and returning

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.650
it to a store, or buying something

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.010
online and going to pick

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.990
it up to a store.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.990
All this is tremendously

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.330
relevant, but it can go much further.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.790


00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.830
In the technology defined in a

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.550
wider way starts from the wearables,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.290
which now has been brake a little,

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.450
but there is something, for example,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.570
the other day was seeing that

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.170
it has been developed, I think

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.790
it was Nike, a jacket to go sports,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.250
to go on a bike, that can

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.550
be connected to the phone, so

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.370
that it warns you when you have

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.670
to turn in a certain direction,

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.790
you are illuminated a part

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.350
of the sleeve by which you

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.250
have to turn.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.210
These are things that are being done,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.870
that are very interesting and that are

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.650
at many levels of the chain.
