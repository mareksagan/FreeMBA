00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.040
Now you understand what Lean Startup

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.340
is, you understand what the process

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.820
is, what the Lean philosophy

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.140
is, and what we will do is identify

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.180
or anticipate what are the mistakes

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.720
that almost everyone makes, and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.420
they are the ones that make a 90%

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.160
of startups die almost in their

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380
first year of life.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.660
I want you to have them very clear

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.060
because they are very common mistakes

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.100
and I would like that if you see yourself

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.080
in the situation that you have to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.820
create a new product or that you

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.060
are developing a business model,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.640
you do not make any of these

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.920
mistakes.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.520
Well, the process of creating a traditional

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.620
product in an environment in which

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.400
there is no uncertainty,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.420
in an environment in which you know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.480
what the characteristics of

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.480
the product are, you know the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.680
customers you are going to address,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.580
you know how it will put the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.880
market, etc., because it is a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.920
market that exists.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.880
The traditional process is that you have

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.840
an idea, you execute that idea, that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.980
is, you develop the product and when

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.880
you go to the market, because

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.480
the market validates it or does not

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.260
validate it.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.720
This means that you make the investment

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.160
before you go out to the market.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.500
However, Lean Startup, what we

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900
propose is a different process in

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.100
which from the idea, the first

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.140
thing we will do is validate

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.140
that idea.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.180
Validate that idea as soon as possible,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.080
without the investment and the strong

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.940
investment we will do it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.240
a posteriori, once it is validated.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.740
Well, let's see what are the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.060
main mistakes that almost

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.480
all entrepreneurs make.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.560
The first thing I see is that when

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.460
someone has an idea, what they

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.220
do is waste a lot of time thinking,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.380
planning, making a business

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.920
plan.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.180
And, more training entrepreneurs

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.660
have, the bigger and more

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.520
sophisticated the business plan is.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.280
They include more variables

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.600
and plan what will happen

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.320
in the next five years.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.720
They plan everything customers will

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.320
do, how much they will pay, how

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.100
much we will grow in sales, when

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.000
we will invest in marketing,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.780
and so on.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.180
Imagine that in a startup the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.020
degree of uncertainty is so high

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.460
that you hardly know what

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.460
will happen in two weeks.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.400
So planning what will happen

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.700
in the next five years is a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.400
sovereign stupidity.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120
It's a stupid thing that will

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300
lead you to get wrong in almost

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.540
everything you're planning.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.820
So don't waste time, don't

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.780
waste time on what you have

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.980
to do is do.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.120
There is also a lot of time being spent

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.020
on market research.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.300
Market studies are very good

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.240
at times because they give you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.080
information about the size of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.580
the market, the competition, etc.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.620
But of course, when you are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.300
creating a new product, a new

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.300
service, when there is so much uncertainty,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.300
when you are creating a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.240
new market, you can't draw

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.740
excessive conclusions

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.820
because they can lead you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.500
to error.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.760
Another very common thing is

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.620
to ask people from your environment

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.020
that the industry.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.440
And in very many cases I don't

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.680
care about the opinion of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.720
the experts, nor do I care about

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.540
the opinion of people, your

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.880
friends, the people around you.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.620
Even if they are people, people tend

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.560
to trust people who have had a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.700
lot of professional success in other

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.640
environments, in many cases in multinationals

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.980
or managers, whatever it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.400
is.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.820
If they say that it is a good idea,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.060
it seems like it strengthens you.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.320
Well, I would tell you that you don't

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.660
listen to the experts in the sector,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.100
nor to the people, even if you have

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.260
a lot of common sense around you,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.520
because they don't have any idea.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.800
The only information that is valuable to me

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.340
is that that which the customers give me.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.860
The only thing that matters is that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.440
when you bring that product to the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.780
market, customers are willing

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.440
to pay for it.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.100
It is the only important thing.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.920
The rest, the opinions of people

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.960
who may seem to you that have

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.160
criteria to know what customers are

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.740
going to do, I think is to take

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.960
excessive risks, because you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.640
have no more criteria than you.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.060
We don't have to assume that we know

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.820
what customers are going to do, we'll see.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.200
So, from that business plan, from

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.600
all that work we have done, from asking,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.980
from analyzing, from studying the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.000
market, what is usually done is, when

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.960
you have already convinced you that

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.620
this, because you have been told

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.180
that it is a very good idea, because

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.840
you have convinced you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960
that it is a magnificent idea,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960
what you do is execute

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.380
that idea.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.680
Execute before validating.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.500
Execute what does it mean?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.600
Start creating the product,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.620
start spending money, start

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.840
getting people to marketing,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.800
for sales, etc.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.940
You will be wrong.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.200
Why are you going to be wrong?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.080
Because in that business plan you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.600
have given, of course, very many

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.780
hypotheses, very many hypotheses

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.380
that a large part of them, customers,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.320
when you go to the market,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.740
will make you see that you

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.540
were wrong.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.080
The first is the main hypothesis,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.980
as I said, and it is to think

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.300
that we know that the customer

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.120
will act as we think.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.460
And that, if you have ever participated

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.320
in meetings, for example, in product

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.800
development, etc., it is very common

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.960
to hear people say, no, because

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.920
if we incorporate these

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.140
functionalities we will

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.400
bring more value.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.520
The best thing is to go out to the market

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.200
and that the customer validate our hypotheses.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.700
But don't give them, of course, because

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.520
it's very easy to get wrong.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.960
It's something you should be going to

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.200
respond to as you think, because it'

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.080
ll surprise you.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.340
Another very common mistake.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.900
Well, since the beginning,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.020
try to build a product that

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.780
is, that is finished, that is

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.120
perfect.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.500
Try to build the product

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.100
you want from day one.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.740
And why?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.760
This product, as we have

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.920
mentioned earlier, is

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.400
the result of many

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.440
hypotheses.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.920
All the features you have added

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.640
to that product are because

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.100
you are considering that those features

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.740
bring more value to the customer.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.900


00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.860
But you do not know.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.900
It is better to do it in another way.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.060
It is better to build a minimum

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.440
viable product and that the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.640
market and customer feedback

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.100
help us build that product

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.320
that is perfect.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.420
Perfect hipo, between cuddles,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.740
because what is perfect for you doesn'

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.240
t have to be perfect in the market.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.940
What does this lead us to, in addition?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.420
Trying to build a perfect product

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.500
leads us to delay the

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.360
launch date.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.320
Usually in the business plan

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.640
you set a launch date, for example,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.020
within six months.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.720
But then you start building the product

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.600
and everything gets complicated and

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.460
deadlines are not met.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.780
In addition, you want the product

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.460
to have more functionality,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.080
be more perfect, perfect

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.420
for you and end up delaying.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.860
What is it that is delaying?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.500
It is delaying the most valuable.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.540
It is delaying contact with

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.660
customers.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.880
Contact with customers is really

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.220
what will allow you to validate,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.360
identify whether those hypotheses

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.800
that are within your business

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.940
plan are valid or not.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.020
Well, and finally, something

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.920
very common is that when you have

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.380
created a product, even sometimes

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.520
you have some attraction, because

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.500
there are customers who

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.020
buy it, etc., well, what you

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.720
do is invest in marketing or

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.280
invest in sales before time.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.920
This is especially true of

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.180
entrepreneurs who come more from the

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.220
business world and who consider that the

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.120
most important thing is to sell it well.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.960
It is also a mistake, because in many

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.180
cases what they are doing is

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.220
trying to prove that they have not

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.480
yet validated, that they bring

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.020
any value.
