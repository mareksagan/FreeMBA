00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.290
Today we will go deeper into

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.490
the concept of discount rate.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.730
The discount rate is a key piece

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.650
that will help us understand

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.730
the van, the shot, how the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.190
discount of cash flows works,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.290
how a company is valued, etc.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.670
If we do not understand this and do not

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.510
understand it intuitively, it

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.510
will be very difficult for us to

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.630
understand the subsequent classes.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.010
Let us go back to the formula.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.590
We have the discounted cash flow

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.670
formula, in which we have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.490
a current value that we will

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.890
get by discounting a series

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.450
of flows that occur in the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.950
future.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.690
They are predictable to occur,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.930
are in the future, have not yet

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.610
occurred, and there is a certain

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.470
risk that these flows will

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.310
occur or not.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.470
So what is the key?

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.870
We make a projection of cash flows,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.830
estimate the flows and what is

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.590
the variable that makes the current

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.910
value greater or lesser?

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.470
The discount factor.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.330
We are dividing each of the flows

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.810
and bringing them to the present moment.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.490
Therefore, it is the discount

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.750
rate that determines the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.950
value of that project,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010
the value of that cash flow.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.860
The first thing I want you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.560
to understand is that the discount

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.520
rate, the rate at which we will discount

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.160
all those flows, depends on

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.080
the profitability we demand

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.720
from the investment.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.120
It may not be intuitive for you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.420
at this time, but I think we will

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.840
understand it throughout the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.520
class.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.440
The discount rate depends on profitability.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.120
If we demand a higher profitability,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.160
we will discount those flows

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.820
at a higher rate and the current

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.940
value will be lower.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.540
Well, let's go deeper into this.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.720
Let's think, I said, the discount

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.140
rate depends on the profitability

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.320
we demand.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.800
We must be able to calculate

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.780
it.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.620
What is the value of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.820
a project, an investment?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.930
It depends on two factors.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.450
The first is the risk-free interest,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.250
that is, the interest you can get

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.070
from another investment

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.650
that does not have risk.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.350
It is usually said in the letters of the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.610
Treasury, for example, of Germany or the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.350
United States.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.430
I want you to understand the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.210
concept.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.550
Imagine that you can get, in

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.150
government bonds, you can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.990
get a return of 25% annually.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.170
What would be the minimum return

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.330
you would require from

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.150
any investment you make, anybody?

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.110
For if I can get a 25% on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.890
an investment that has a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.830
very low risk, why am

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.310
I going to get into any jaleo

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.530
if it doesn't offer me

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.590
a higher return?

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.950
I think it is easy to understand.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.310
The first factor is

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.450
risk-free interest.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.090
In addition, to the profitability

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.310
we demand we will add, in addition

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.190
to the interest without risk, we will

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.870
add the risk premium.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.830
What is the risk premium?

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.310
Depending on the risk that exists

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.330
or we perceive, we will demand

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.830
greater profitability in that investment,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.910
in that project, in that company.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.410
This is one of the class economics.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.410
More profitability, more risk

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.350
If we perceive that those cash flows

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350
that have been projected,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.390
imagine, they have told us, you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.230
will receive $100,000 every year.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110
If we perceive that there is a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.730
lot of risk that these cash flows are

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.250
actually given or not, because it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.970
depends on many factors, well, whatever

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.670
it is.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.090
If we perceive a lot of risk,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.710
we have to discount those cash

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.090
flows at a higher rate.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.710
We have to take this risk premium.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.010
Therefore, the required profitability

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.630
is equal, we must understand

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.970
that it is equal to the interest

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.270
we can get without risk plus

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.210
a risk premium.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.690
As I said, the discount

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.010
rate is this.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.370
The discount rate is calculated

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.910
as the risk-free interest

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.790
plus the risk premium.
