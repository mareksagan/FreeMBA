00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.380
We will learn to calculate profitability

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.360
from the financial statements,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.380
the profitability of

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.200
a company and the partners

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.260
of the company.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.040
We have started by reinforcing the basic

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.300
concept of profitability.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.440
What is Rentability?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.960
This is the profit divided between

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.760
the investment.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.540
Therefore, to calculate profitability

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.960
we must go, on the one hand,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.940
to the state of results,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.140
to the account of results,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.460
which informs us of the profit.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.100
And on the other hand, we have

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.300
to go to the situation balance that

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.400
informs us of the investment

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.740
we have made.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.640
And what we will do is remember

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
the functioning of the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.400
balance sheet.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060
Remember, on the one hand we have the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.580
origins of financing, it is the block

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.840
of the right and it tells us where

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.780
the financing comes from.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.240
And on the other hand we have the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.140
applications, which informs us about the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.080
destination of those investments.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.300
This is the picture of the balance sheet.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.100
What are the origins?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.360
Equity or equity

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.900
and the debt.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.820
Are the destinations?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.540
The assets we invested in.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480
Well, the most important thing about this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880
class is that I want you to understand that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.520
there are two different concepts

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.500
or two different profitability that are

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
two different perspectives.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.620
We have economic profitability and

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.800
financial profitability.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.480
And I will begin by explaining the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.060
profitability assets.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.620
Rentability on assets.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.700
Why is it called economic profitability?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.800
It is very important that you understand

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.920
the difference in the concept between

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.440
economic and financial.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.920
Economic refers to the economic

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.340
activity of the company.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.100
It does not matter how we are funded.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700
So how is the ROA calculated?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.020
The net profit is calculated by

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
dividing the total asset between

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.440
the total investment.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.260
How we consider what the company

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.420
is doing, whether it has made

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.520
good investments, whether it is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.400
getting a good profitability

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.980
from its assets, etc.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.320
But this gives us a perspective

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.460
but does not give us the full

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.680
perspective because often what

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.920
we want to know is, well, but what

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.060
is the profitability of the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.380
investment we have made?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.240
What is the profitability of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.440
the company’s own funds?

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.760
This is called financial profitability.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.620
ROE, Return on Equity, is the term

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.320
for profitability on equity.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.100
How is it calculated?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.760
very simple though.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.460
In this case, what we do is divide

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.760
the net profit instead of between

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.800
the total of the asset, we divide

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.920
it between the equity, between

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.080
the own funds.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.980
You understand both perspectives.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.940
Now what we need to know is how it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.720
is calculated or how they

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.040
relate to one another, right?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.600
And we see it in this formula, it is very simple.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.120
Financial profitability, i.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.380
e. the profitability of equity,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.260
is equal to the profitability

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.680
we obtain in the asset, by

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.620
the asset, by a multiplier

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.020
that has to do with leverage.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180
Let us see it briefly in this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.700
example.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.920
We will think that this company

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.860
that we have on screen with this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.920
balance sheet is getting

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.680
a net profit of one million euros

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
and the equity is 300,000, the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.060
rest is debt, that is, the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.860
partners have put 300,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.900
000 euros.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.280
And now we’ll think of the same

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.640
company, but let’s imagine

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.960
it has been funded differently.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.920
In this case, the partners instead of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.740
putting 300,000 euros, have put

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.780
only 150,000, that is, they have obtained

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.920
more debt, they have invested half

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.460
that in the previous case.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.380
So what is the return

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.740
on funds that the return on profit

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.880
is the profit divided between

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.280
the investment?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.540
If the investment is half,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.140
the return will be double.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.700
We will see in this formula.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840
It is the same formula, but more detailed.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.220
The ROE is equal to the ROA, remember,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.180
the ROA is the profit divided between

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.140
the asset, by the multiplier.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.120
And here what I want is

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.040
that we go to the leverage

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.040
multiplier formula.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.080
I am aware that the formula

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.660
you will forget in five minutes.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.660
The important thing is that you

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.900
understand how leverage makes

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.640
multiply or leverage, leverage

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.220
the profitability of partners.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.740
Go to the detail.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.160
We will multiply the profitability

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.120
of the asset by an amount and

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.720
that amount is equal to the asset

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.060
divided between the equity.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.500
And so that you are more

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.800
intuitive and easier to remember,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.260
let’s look at a case.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320
Let’s look at a company where the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.920
asset is 100 and the equity is 100,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.260
that is, the multiplier is one,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.420
because there has been no

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.980
leverage, because all the asset

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.720
has been financed with own funds.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.860
However, now we will see

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.160
another case in which there

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.240
has been leverage, because

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.540
part of that asset that

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.820
is also 100 has been funded

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.080
with debt and equity we

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.560
only had to put 10.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.460
Therefore, there is a multiplier of

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.520
10, that is, in this second case

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.780
what we have achieved by leveraging

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.240
is to multiply by 10 the profitability

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.180
we get from the asset.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.780
