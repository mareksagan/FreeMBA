00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.360
We already know what are

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.860
the operational needs of funds, what

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.860
is the net investment it has to have,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740
what a company has to carry out

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.660
to be able to carry out the operational

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.720
activity, the daily activity

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.060
of the company.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.620
And we also saw that they depend on,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.800
if we see it in the balance sheet,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.180
it depends on the balance of customers,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080
it depends on the balance of stocks

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.200
we have and it depends

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.080
on the balance of suppliers.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.940
The lower the NOFs, the smaller

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.520
that investment is needed,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.420
the better, because that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.380
minimizes the financial

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.720
needs we have.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.880
Today we will look at the NFC

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.080
from a different perspective.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.820
We will analyze the working capital

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.140
cycle or the cycle of exploitation

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200
or also known as the middle

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.040
period of financial maturity,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.620
as you see it is called

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.910
from different types, but we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.080
always talk about the same.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.980
Basically, the NOFs, that amount

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.360
we have to finance depends on three

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.420
magnitudes, three magnitudes

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.660
that we will relate in a cycle

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.020
and are magnitudes as to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.140
the number of days.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.580
You will understand well.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.220
Let’s think of a company that buys

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.540
goods or buys raw materials,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.800
it doesn’t matter if it’s a commercial

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.700
company that is a manufacturer

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.320
and pays its suppliers

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.800
a few days later and is the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.100
average payment period.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.740
That company, in addition, from

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.900
the time it buys the goods until

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.100
it sells them, since it usually takes

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.840
an average number of days that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300
depends on the rotation of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.620
the inventories of stocks.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.340
The higher the rotation, the shorter

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.380
that time limit and there comes a day

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.380
when it sells.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.640
And in this case what it does

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.740
is pay a few days later.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.000
You could charge the bill, but in this

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.140
case it costs a few days later,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.920
it’s the average period of collection.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.660
The working capital

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.200
cycle is the number of days

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.120
since we pay the suppliers,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.920
that is, from the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.700
time the treasury leaves

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.480
our box until we

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.000
recover it.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.580
It depends on the three factors

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.280
we have seen.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520
It depends on the average payment period,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.180
depends on the average number of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.340
days in stock and depends on

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.980
the average collection period.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.180
What we need to do is optimize

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.040
these sizes the later we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.700
pay the suppliers.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.700
The less time it is in the stock

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.280
in the warehouse, that is,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.260
the higher the rotation

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.680
and the sooner we charge

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.220
customers, the better.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.020
This cycle has been cut.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.840
What implications does that have?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.260
The operational needs

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.660
of funds are much smaller.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.780
Let us look at two examples.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.620
Let’s think first of a distributor

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.200
or a wholesaler of furniture.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.500
And we will think that it sells,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.800
on the one hand, sells to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.160
small distributors, retail and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.000
also sells to the consumer on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.740
a giant ship.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.380
Let’s look at the two cycles.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.720
The first is the following.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.300
Buy the furniture from the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.000
manufacturers, pay them 30 days.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.340
From the time you buy until you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.720
sell the furniture, it usually

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.460
takes an average of 90 days,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.640
which other dealers do is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480
charge 30 days.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.560
The furniture store pays you

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.520
for 30 days.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.680
So what is the working capital

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.540
cycle in this case?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.740
It is 90 days.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.380
From the time the supplier pays until

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.500
it charges customers, 90 days

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.140
pass.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.400
You have to fund the activity

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.480
for 90 days.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240
But, as we said, it also sells to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.440
the private.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.380
You can go to the ship and buy

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.900
furniture.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.400
In this case, the individuals

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.180
pay the bill, not pay 30 days.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.300
We have shortened the cycle.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.460
We cut it from 90 to 60 days.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.560
This activity, the sale

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.220
to the private, in this case,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.520
has a smaller operational

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.460
fund needs.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.020
In either of the two, if we

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.960
analyze the situation balance

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.840
sheet, what this company has

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.440
is that it has positive NOFs,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.900
because suppliers help you to

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.740
finance part of the operational

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.160
activity, but not all.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.660
Therefore, you have to have that permanent

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.440
investment there that you have

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.060
to finance.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.240
As we can see, the red block

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.880
is the total amount of the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.960
financial needs that the company

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.380
has.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.180
Now let’s go to a case where

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.620
NOFs are negative.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.740
That is, we do not have to make

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.260
an investment because the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.900
company’s own activity is financing

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.560
the operations.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.160
When is this given?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.300
For example, in

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.560
the food market.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.820
This is the most common case that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.260
always occurs.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.660
And what we do is that stocks,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.320
food products are purchased, and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.200
we have a high and average

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.860
rotation from when they are purchased

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.640
until they leave the supermarket,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.720
about 30

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.340
days pass.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.120
What happens here is,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.920
look, as our suppliers are

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.400
companies much smaller than

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.700
us, we’ll pay them 90

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.640
days.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.880
We pay at the expense.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.640
Look at how the situation is.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.080
We buy goods, we pay for 90 days,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.580
but at 30 days we have already

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.720
sold them.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.340
In this case, the cycle

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.360
is negative.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.740
That is, the suppliers are

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.480
helping us to finance the

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.740
company’s operational activity

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.220
for 60 days.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.000
The NOFs are negative.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.120
We do not really need to make an

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.100
investment.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.080
Very simple, right?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.160
You buy, but pay very late and

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.320
when you have to pay the supplier

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.500
you already have the stocks,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.420
those goods.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.060
Is the provider funding you?

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.500
If we go to the balance

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.580
sheet, we see it clearly.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.200
In this case, NOFs are negative

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720
and the overall financial needs

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.340
have decreased enormously.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.020
So, the providers are helping

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.920
us finance the fixed

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.660
assets.
