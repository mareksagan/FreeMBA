00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Power Launch Formula, as you surely know, is a formula, a guide, a method that helps you

00:09.800 --> 00:16.800
step by step, accompanies you, helps you to launch innovative products, services, business models.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.320
So today we are going to talk about this innovative concept. Why? Because you are going to understand

00:21.320 --> 00:26.560
the scope of this well. It will help you identify whether this is actually for you or not, but also

00:26.560 --> 00:32.560
I want us to reflect on the concept of innovation because it has enormous implications in the business world.

00:32.560 --> 00:38.560
It is very important that we understand well what it means to make decisions with a certain degree of innovation

00:38.560 --> 00:43.560
and what are the implications in terms of potential, risk, focus and so on.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.560
We are talking about launching products, services, business models. So what we are going to do is

00:47.560 --> 00:51.560
we are going to compare two extremes, although as we always say, things are not black or white,

00:51.560 --> 00:56.560
there is usually a gray scale, but when we understand the two extremes it is much easier.

00:56.560 --> 01:03.560
So we are going to compare the case that we launch a very innovative product with the opposite case,

01:03.560 --> 01:08.560
which is what we do is imitate competitors in a market that already exists.

01:08.560 --> 01:16.560
Innovative product. Really here it is very easy to understand, what we do is create a disruptive, different value proposition

01:16.560 --> 01:22.560
and you have to understand that it can be in a market that already exists or if the degree of innovation is still greater,

01:22.560 --> 01:26.560
what you do is create a new market, for example a blue ocean.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.560
In the case that what we do is compete in a market that already exists, well that's it.

01:30.560 --> 01:37.560
There is a market that has a size to the market, a number of customers, we already know and there are a series of companies

01:37.560 --> 01:40.560
that have their proposals and what you do is do the same as the others.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.560
It can be a little better, a little cheaper, etc.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.560
I think we already understand the two concepts and we go to the implications.

01:49.560 --> 01:57.560
The first and very important is that when we innovate the risk is much greater, because there is uncertainty,

01:57.560 --> 02:03.560
because what you do is launch a new product, a new service and you have no idea what is going to happen.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.560
You have no idea if there are going to be values, if they are going to buy you, etc.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.560
In the case that what we do is imitate the proposals of others, the risk is very low,

02:11.560 --> 02:15.560
because you already know what is going to happen, because there are people who are buying those companies

02:15.560 --> 02:20.560
and I am going to imitate a company like that, I am going to change a few things, I already know more or less what is going to happen.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.560
Higher risk when we innovate, but, and this is very important,

02:24.560 --> 02:29.560
you have to be clear that the potential is much greater when you are innovating.

02:29.560 --> 02:35.560
You can grow faster, the benefits are greater, the margins are greater, because at the beginning you do not have competition

02:35.560 --> 02:41.560
and this is even more extreme when what you do is create a blue ocean, a new market space in which you do not have competitors.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.560
On the other hand, when you compete, the potential is much lower.

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
There are already other competitors and what you do is, well, if you do it well,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.560
what you are going to get is a percentage of the market share.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.560
It is very important that we take into account, and this is perhaps a little more difficult to understand,

02:59.560 --> 03:07.560
that really the focus, the management approach, the competencies that you need are very different to innovate and to compete.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.560
There are even people who are worth one thing and people who are worth another.

03:11.560 --> 03:17.560
When we innovate, the approach has to be to look for, and you will understand it well throughout the Power Launch Formula.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.560
You have to permanently look for what is the best value proposition, how to evolve that proposition,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.560
until it fits perfectly with a client segment.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.560
On the other hand, when you compete, when you enter a market that already exists, you do not have to look for,

03:31.560 --> 03:35.560
what you have to do is execute, execute in time, in form, in cost, etc.

03:36.560 --> 03:42.560
It is totally different, it is to innovate, to look for, it is a much greater intellectual challenge,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.560
but as we have seen before, the potential is also higher.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.560
And finally, regarding financing, there are many entrepreneurs who are concerned about this.

03:51.560 --> 03:59.560
When you launch innovative models, if the market is large, if the model is scalable, etc.,

03:59.560 --> 04:05.560
you will be able to count on the help of professional investors, business angels and others,

04:05.560 --> 04:10.560
because they will be interested in you, because they will be able to obtain a very high profitability from your investment.

04:10.560 --> 04:16.560
If you enter a market that already exists, with a proposal like the others,

04:16.560 --> 04:22.560
the potential will be much lower and therefore it is very difficult for investors of this type to trust you.

04:22.560 --> 04:29.560
What you will have to do is put your money and resort to traditional financing, like all companies in life.

04:29.560 --> 04:35.560
We summarize it, innovate, when we innovate the potential is much higher, you can do whatever you want,

04:35.560 --> 04:38.560
you can revolutionize a sector, you can become a millionaire, whatever,

04:38.560 --> 04:43.560
but you have to take into account that it is much more difficult and that the risk is much higher.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.560
I am going to give you three examples of Power MBA.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.560
What we did was go to the market with an innovative proposal,

04:48.560 --> 04:54.560
a different proposal than the rest of the business schools, and the potential is huge.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.560
We have created a blue ocean and we are growing a lot.

04:56.560 --> 05:03.560
We do not have competition, but the risk was very high, because when we thought about this proposal,

05:03.560 --> 05:06.560
we had no idea at first if a single client was going to buy us,

05:06.560 --> 05:10.560
we did not know if people were going to see value in making an MBA,

05:10.560 --> 05:14.560
that it was like a series in audiovisual format, etc. You already know the proposal.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.560
I assure you that we did not know.

05:16.560 --> 05:22.560
Your lottery, your lottery is a true case of success, of innovation in the lottery sector.

05:22.560 --> 05:28.560
What Eduardo, his founder, realized that buying the lottery in an application was,

05:28.560 --> 05:32.560
the client experience was much better, but there was no one who did it,

05:32.560 --> 05:34.560
therefore the risk was very high.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.560
What happened is that, of course, the subsequent growth has been gigantic,

05:38.560 --> 05:41.560
because no one else did it and there are almost no competitors yet.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.560
Or the case of Samplea, Samplea is a case of true innovation.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.560
Robert, you surely know Samplea already,

05:48.560 --> 05:55.560
because one day he thought that if he placed sample dispensing machines in shopping centers,

05:55.560 --> 05:59.560
people would be interested in queuing, downloading the application and so on,

05:59.560 --> 06:02.560
but that was in his head, he had not validated it yet.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.560
The risk was very high.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.560
And I'm going to end with a reflection.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.560
As we have said, when you are able to launch innovative models,

06:10.560 --> 06:13.560
the potential is gigantic, you will be able to do whatever you want.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.560
And the risk is much higher.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.560
But the important thing here is that you learn to innovate,

06:18.560 --> 06:20.560
it is not a matter of being a visionary,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.560
you learn, it is a matter of knowledge, it is a matter of method.

06:23.560 --> 06:27.560
And that is exactly what we are going to do in Power Launch Formula.
