WEBVTT

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.200
We have already identified what

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.180
are the factors around which competition

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.840
revolves, in which they are

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.020
investing and what we

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.260
value customers.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.240
And what we're going to do now

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240
is draw the value curves of the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.000
four segments I have asked you.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.240
Luxury, premium or quality restaurants

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.180
that are a little below those

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.700
of luxury, neighborhood

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.120
restaurants and low

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.120
cost chains.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.640
You will see how it helps

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.580
us visualize what each

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.100
of them is focusing on.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.260
It is important to keep in mind that

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.000
the different proposals, the different

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.640
value curves are born from a knowledge

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.320
of the particular needs of the customer

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.160
segment to which each segment

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.400
is addressed, because obviously

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.460
they are different segments

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.880
and for different uses.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.720
We start with the luxury restaurants.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.300
We are talking about restaurants

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.100
with a Michelin star, a menu for

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.500
tasting, because a very high price

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.700
of more than 100 euros.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.120
What is the value curve?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.620
It is very easy to draw the curve of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.080
value.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.820
Why is it?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.740
Because they invest a lot and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.540
offer a lot of value in almost every

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.180
factor, in everything related

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.480
to quality, with the brand, with

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.840
the chef, with the environment,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.320
with the decoration, however.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.860
In the only thing, what they

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.480
do not invest in, because it is not important

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.020
and is an interesting analysis,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.960
is in convenience.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.640
It is not important for a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.880
restaurant of this type the convenience.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.380
You may be located 20 kilometers

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.740
from the nearest population

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.280
centre.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.460
No matter, people will move

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.820
to such a restaurant.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.820
You don't offer convenience, right?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.420
No offer...

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.280
Look, in many cases, if you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.940
want to book a table you have to

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.900
wait months, etc.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.980
It is not thought of as far

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.400
as convenience, as far as comfort.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.500
Well, of all these, if

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.180
we had to identify two factors

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.120
that are the key factors now

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.660
that are determining the competition

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.440
between this type of restaurants

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.840
currently is the chef.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.680


00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.400
Having a chef, a recognized

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.260
figure, is very important to them.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.360
And in the brand, the brand, we were

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.440
talking, because remember, for

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.960
example, having Michelin stars.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.940
These are the two factors

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.160
that create a competitive

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.060
advantage.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.220
The main difference is that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.300
you would go to a restaurant

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.120
or another.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.240
Well, let's now analyze the second

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.260
segment that are quality,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.760
luxury, premium restaurants,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.460
etc.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040
Not a lot, but a little below the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.120
luxury.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.720
They are restaurants with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.260
lower prices, but they

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.600
are used for business meals

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.180
or for dinners or weekends,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.900
etc.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.600
What is the value curve?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.040
It is easy to paint because it is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760
a little underneath everything.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460
For as far as price, as far as quality,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.240
as far as a less recognized chef,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.820
as far as the sophistication

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.140
of the food and so on.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.800
There is a point where it is above

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.240
the luxury restaurants and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.720
it is in convenience.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.180
You think that this type

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.600
of restaurants are usually located

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.120
in cities, in urban environments,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.980
often have car parks, that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.420
is, they are designed to make

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.180
it convenient to go.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.400
Because keep in mind that if you eat

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.440
on the weekend or if you are going

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.780
to eat a business meal, etc.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.100
It must be convenient.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.100
It is a less sporadic use than the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.060
luxury restaurant, so it has

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.540
to be comfortable.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.120
Let us now think about how it is

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.900
the proposal of a neighborhood

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.340
restaurant or a restaurant of

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.480
the day menu.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.440
Well, I think the proposal

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
is obviously below the previous

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.160
restaurants in terms

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640
of price, in terms of quality,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.540
in terms of sophistication.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.640
The chef is not a recognized

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.940
figure, you don't have to invest in

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.460
that.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.000
But there are two keys I want

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.500
to highlight.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.300
One, personal service is important,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.120
it is below because they invest less,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.260
but it is important for

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.560
this type of restaurants the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.600
value of knowing their customers,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.740
of being very close to their

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.420
customers.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.600
The most important factor is the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.940
convenience in this case.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.960
You have to remember that they

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.140
are restaurants you have to go to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.060
on a daily basis.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.420
For example, the restaurant

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.980
menu of the day you eat on

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.660
your work break, must

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.440
be nearby.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.220
If you are not near, you are not comfortable,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.440
you are not fast, you will not come back.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.140
Comfort is a key factor.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.940
And it turns out that this proposal

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.400
or this segment has been a

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
huge competitor for a few years.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.060
And they are chains, the first was Pret

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.380
a Manger.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.280
There are many chains, you probably

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.040
know them.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.680
There are many chains of this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.240
type near the office centers.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.840
You can serve yourself, almost it is a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.380
self-service where you pick up dishes, etc.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440
and pay.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.400
And it is very, very, very fast.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.300
So it is very convenient.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.900
It is much more thought-out for this

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.680
type of use.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.500
Therefore, they have sought their

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.100
differentiation from the traditional

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.020
neighborhood restaurant.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.500
This is mainly due to two factors.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.600
One, which we said is faster.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.160
You have an hour of rest,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.260
imagine, at work.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.460
Well, you come here and in five minutes

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.260
you have the food and you are sitting.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.080
In a restaurant menu of the day

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.240
you have to wait, etc.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.060
It is more valuable.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.300
They also incorporated another factor.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.600
You can choose healthy food.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.420
This is something that has made

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.680
a lot of people, say, who migrate

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.700
or prefer this type of proposals.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.460
And they are cheaper than the restaurants

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.500
than the menu of the day.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.240
This is a very interesting analysis.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.960
Here is the curve of value.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.020
The value curve of the chain like

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.560
Pret to Manger, for example, is below

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.680
that of the menu of the day, that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.040
of the neighborhood restaurant

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.840
in terms of sophistication, etc.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.440
As for the price.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.160
But it has more value than

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.760
we say.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.640
It is faster.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.440
It's also healthier, right?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.100
I think this is a very, very interesting analysis.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.780
Now, let's go to the low cost chains.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.860
The low cost chains, the curve

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.240
is absolutely very, very, very

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.700
below.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.680
As for price, sophistication, chef,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.960
they don't have a chef, they're completely

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.400
standard processes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.360
What they offer is a price.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.160
The advantage for the customer is that

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.560
the price is obviously very cheap.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.840
It is a low cost competition.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.060
They are very convenient restaurants.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.300
There are many points of sale.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.760
It is fast.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.300
They often go through etc.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.840
But they incorporate a factor

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.980
that had not been taken into account

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.860
so far.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.040
We did not name him.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.000
None of the above.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.880
And it is the possibility of with

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.180
the family, for example, and that the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.160
children are playing.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.620
Even in many cases in

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.680
restaurants there is a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.800
dedicated space for children

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.540
to play.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.100
This, this particular factor, is what

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.780
makes in many cases families choose

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.820
this option because it is thought

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.320
for family and for child with

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.560
respect to all the previous ones.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.940
This is not the price in many cases.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.640
It is also the price.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.680
But this factor, the factor incorporating

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.880
the family factor is very

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.540
important.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.440
And now I'll analyze the value

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.800
proposal of two types of restaurants

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.480
to illustrate a bit how there are

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.980
proposals that seek their concrete

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.260
differentiation.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.580
Imagine a restaurant in an environment

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.460
like the one we are seeing,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.280
on the beach.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.600
How did you find your differentiation?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.640
In a particular case, such

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.280
as the location of the first.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.180
This restaurant is

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.540
just like that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.660
There is room for all kinds of differences.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.820
I will give you another example.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.660
A vegan restaurant.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.900
How did you find your differentiation?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.340
Focus on a very specific segment

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.740
of customers incorporating

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.180
a factor that others had

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.300
not taken into account.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.780
All food is vegan

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.180
or vegetarian.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.800
It is an example of how he has sought

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.060
his hole, his space.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.340
If we go to Michael Porter's

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.180
generic strategies, in the last

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.760
case we've seen it's clear that

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.160
what they've done is focusing

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.840
on a very small niche of the

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.620
population.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.020
What happens is that by focusing on that

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.680
niche, it allows them to offer a very

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.800
suitable proposal.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.660
They are vegetarians or vegans and

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.520
they offer them a meal, the only

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.360
food that meets the

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.680
needs of that niche.
