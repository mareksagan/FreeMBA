00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.890
Pilar, let's analyze the

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.310
blablacar segmentation strategy.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.970
To know how to segment well, the most

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.410
important thing is to know

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.350
the variables or the segmentation

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.650
criteria and when you know everything

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.950
it is easier to identify what is

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.830
to apply to each case, business

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.950
model or whatever.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.610
And what you do is enter the variables,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.270
for each variable you get some segments

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.750
and then the next key is that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.490
those segments use them for

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.910
something, that is, that you adapt

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.710
something, the proposal, the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.670
channels, the messages,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.910
I don't know what you can adapt.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.550
Because if you segment and don't adapt

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.250
anything, that's what many people

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950
do, because it's that for that you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.270
don't segment, that doesn't make sense.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.190
So, it would be good to analyze

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.910
this, what variables you use, what

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.850
it serves you to and what you adapt to.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.390
Indeed, segmentation would be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.390
the first step because when we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.490
have the significant

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.450
segments for each of those

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.290
segments.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.670
From there we have already lowered

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.750
the concrete message and the most

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.470
suitable channel to reach each segment.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.910
The first variable we use and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.110
the most important in our

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.390
case is the funnel.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.730
What is the Funnel?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.050
This is the moment when the current

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.930
or potential customer is

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.610
in relation to the perception

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.710
of blablacar.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.050
The funnel in our case would be,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.350
first step, who does not know blablacar.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.790
In our case, that stage is already more

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.130
than overcome, because we

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.790
landed in Spain 10 years ago and

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.110
all that 98% of Spaniards already

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.070
know blablacar.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.430
The second...

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.670
That is, you really have no objectives here

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.730
anymore, because you have already

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.190
accomplished them.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.030
Exactly, we have already fulfilled it.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.850
I assume it was.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.790
That is, at some point, this current

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.030
segmentation, all your market

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.570
is segmenting it, in the first part,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.770
above all, there is no longer a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.650
2% that not But I imagine that

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.390
at the time that was the big bread,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.310
isn't it?

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.030
Effectively, at the time, the first

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.970
years of landing, there was a lot

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.830
of work of holding, a lot of branding

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.570
and also a lot of educational content,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.190
because in the end you have

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.870
to start by explaining what the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.970
famous carpooling means,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.970
sharing car, what it brings,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.710
the issue of saving in costs

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.190
and sharing it all.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.610
The interesting thing is what changes

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.570
the strategy in this case,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.290
simply over time, because of having

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.610
to do campaigns, trying

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.370
to educate people in what this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.910
is, Exactly.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.370
What not?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.690
That stage is already over.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.830
You have others now, right?

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.310
And the next, it would be to define

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.350
the target audience we can reach

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.330
first and then divide

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.630
it by stages.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.210
So, to put us in context,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.950
in Spain there are 46 million

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.470
people and who can use it in

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.770
the face is all the older and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.490
with access to the internet.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.510
We understand that from 65 years

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.610
old it is very difficult to convince

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.730
you and that you start using

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.530
it in the face, so our Market

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.910
Universe, our TAM, is 24 million.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270
We will see it in a later class.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.770
24 million, then we have to segment

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.270
those 24 million.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.230
Of those 24 million, five already

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.470
use Blah Blah Car.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.850
It means that we still have

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.630
80% of the cake to focus

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.990
on and convince for the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.010
first time to use it

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.990
in the car.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.270
24 million, the segment that they

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.350
don't know you is residual and then

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.670
you have a segment of people

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.830
who know you but who have not

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.690
yet used it.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.750
What are they?

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.230
For this is our great challenge and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.310
it is that for us the great challenge

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.170
now in this stage is the consideration

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.730
that is that people who have heard

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.030
about Blah Blah Car but who

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.770
still do not launch to use

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.130
it, have not used you.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.650
Here we have to focus the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.530
messages trying to break those

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.670
barriers with For example,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.470
if people don't want to use

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.270
Blah Blah Car because it fears

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.010
that of getting into someone

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.430
unknown, well because we put

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.270
levers in that technological

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.710
layer to make it really

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.490
go from being a stranger

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.590
to being a person you've met

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.630
in Blah Blah Car, then through

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.110
the famous ratings,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.510
through a profile by which

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.650
you can meet in a certain

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.770
way other users.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.410
Let us identify those objections.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.730
Within this segment, many

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.050
segments can also be made.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.530
There will be people who are far away,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.890
there will be people who are closer.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.210
Even within that very large segment,

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.610
if we did, we could do segments

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.950
based on different profiles because

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.970
there will be people who will

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.450
never in life really consider

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.850
you and others yes and others

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.750
yes, right?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.270
actually is.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.610
You have to identify that,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.770
identify what stops them and try to

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.430
activate them.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.890
And if we go down, that is, we already

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.350
have, those who don't know you, there

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.330
are not, those who know you but have

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.910
not used you, there is a giant ocean.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.770
The Giant.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.470
We continue to descend.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.570
We continue to descend.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.330
Have you ever convinced them or explained

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.610
them well what Blah Blah Car is?

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.430
I think it's Blah Blah Car.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.890
So the next step is that when

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.330
they have that need to travel,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.410
they remember you and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.310
use Blah Blah Car.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.710
The next step is the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.010
acquisition.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.870
Acquisition in our case is to

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.390
install the Blah Blah Car app and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.530
register.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.290
The next segment in the funnel

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.830
is those people who have

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.670
downloaded the app but have not

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.450
yet used us.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.130
Our goal here is to activate them

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.030
through actions.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.710
And how is it done?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.630
How do you manage to do it?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.450
through the actions of the FRM.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.790
We send you messages so that

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.850
you remember that we are there

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.050
for the next time you need to make

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650
a trip that you consider.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.190
This is a challenge really in all applications

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.090
because in Tulotero it

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.410
happens the same.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.630
In the case of Tulotero the application

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.710
is downloaded but, for example, because

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.830
they do not make the first bet.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.650
And you risk that it will stay

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.250
there, right?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.990
It is of no use to you.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.970
Do you have to remind them, etc., in

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.750
our case you have to remind

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.370
them depending on whether you are

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.610
a passenger or a driver?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.850
In our case, activation would be

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.310
in the case of a driver publishing

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.830
a trip and in the case of the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.190
passenger it would be to

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.330
reserve a seat for a trip.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.790
The next segment.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.990
The next segment.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.650
You have already activated, posted

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.790
or booked a seat.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.170
So you would go to a Successful

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.810
Trip that would be the real journey

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.830
to the offline experience and the

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.550
next goal, the next segment

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.050
is that you give ratings, right?

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.030
This is a key to re-alimenting

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.290
the community.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.870
After the off-line experience

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.050
and the experience of your car...

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.750
That is, the segment is the one that has

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.290
made a journey.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.910
and exact.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.710
And the next segment is the one that

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.130
in addition to making a trip has made

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.770
a valuation.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.790
You really need to value.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.650
That is, you have already made the conversion,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.730
as it returns to the digital environment

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.310
and values the passenger or driver

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.550
you have traveled with.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.050
This is key for the community to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.930
continue to foster trust.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.850
It is interesting because this is a segment.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.430
If we compare it from above and

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.850
so on, this is a segment with

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.710
more detail,.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.270
That is, this segmentation is

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.390
segmenting according to, look,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.890
how curious you have made or

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.130
not a rating after a trip,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.610
right?

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.730
and yes.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.850
It seems very detailed, but

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.970
it is very important to you.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.450
The key.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.250
Why is it?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.050
Because it feeds the rating and so on.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.730
That is why.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.230
Of course, because it feeds the rating

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.290
and, in the end, what you do is to

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.710
favor people who are there doubting

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.770
whether to use it in the face or

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.830
not, go through the...

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.230
I am going on a trip with the

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.730
driver Menganito, of whom I don't know

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.550
anything, to...

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.470
Well, it is that Menganito has already

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.190
taken 300 people and has a

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.990
score of 4.7 out of 5.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.610
That gives you a lot more confidence.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.410


00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.810
Value is key to us.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.230
More segments, below

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.370
And more segments is, once you have

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.010
made your first trip and you have been

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.970
a success, it is already the retention part.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.310
Repeat with us.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.330
The reality is that, in Blablacar,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.850
people try for the first time for

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.170
pure reason, for pure economic

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.010
fact, but then, thanks to all that

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.990
experience that has passed on the

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.050
trip, it repeats on a more emotional

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.110
side, because it has been an

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.050
enriching experience.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.290
So we play with more

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.410
emotional content so you

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.390
can remember to use us again.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.810
You have really done many events

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.430
based on the relationship it has

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.010
with you, but what has become

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.550
very clear is that the message

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.330
and actions you have to do

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.390
with each segment are absolutely

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.750
different.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.190
In one case, you said no, you value it.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.450
You will have to make

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.050
the rating.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.090
It is a very concrete action.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.930
To him who has already tried it once,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.070
etc., he has traveled and so on, because

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.010
what you have to do is to impact him

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.510
back by remembering.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:20.790
and exact.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.510
Taking advantage, for example, of the

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.930
fact that there is a bridge and remembering

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.250
a week before, you hear, on this

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.550
bridge, what good, good weather,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.650
we all go there.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.310
Remember that if you do it as it

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.550
was, you will have it as well

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.010
as last time, for example.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:33.950
and perfect.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.510
More of Variable?

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.530
The second variable is sociodemographic,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.130
which you can imagine, is

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.010
to understand gender, age.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.670
The population is all of Spain

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.010
except the islands.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.410
And then we try to follow very closely

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.450
the whole part of the

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.210
evolution of our community.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.110
Understand if, for example, at

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.510
the beginning of the first stage, the

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.190
vast majority of our community were

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.270
young students 18 or 24 years old who

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.110
wanted to travel, they didn't have

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.670
a pastry, and the only way to do

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.790
so was with a blabla car, otherwise

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.770
they stayed at home.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.370
And we follow very close to that

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.210
evolution and we see that it has

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.330
now evolved and is a much more

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.250
homogeneous community, since

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.710
a third is between 18 and 24, but

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.890
a third is already between

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.310
25 and 34 and a third is already

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.090
over 35 years old.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.890
So, precisely for those messages we

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.390
have to go to each segment is very

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.690
important because each segment,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.810
according to gender, age and their

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.810
interests, will be interested

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.970
in a value proposal that can

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.070
offer them the blabla car or

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.790
another.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.330
Here is a segmentation, I understand

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.730
that by the model itself, the geographic

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.830
is important, because your

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.950
proposal is a bit different

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.750
depending on where you live.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.390
It is so, you cannot...

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.270
actually is.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.530
The needs that a person

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.610
who lives in a big city has

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.470
or the value you can lend him

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.030
by the number of trips

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.010
there and more.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.030
Yes, the demographic theme is very

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.150
important in blabla car because,

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.630
in fact, one of the biggest

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.270
added values is what we

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.350
call point-to-point.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.270
And it's that you can go from the door

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.930
of your home to the door of your grandmother's

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.570
house in the village directly.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.530
It is the most direct way to travel.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.230
This is especially important for

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.090
locations that are not well connected.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.330
So, all these locations

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.290
can be emphasized with this

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.670
message because it is what

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.830
really brings value to them.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.550
Have you sermented

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.350
geographically, identifying a serment

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.730
of people who live in locations

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.150
that are not capital provinces?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.730


00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.430
and exact.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.230
The message with them is different.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.790
Of course, to the localities that

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.790
are not provincial capitals the

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.790
key message is, hear, what better

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.510
way to travel than with a blabla

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.690
car that will take you by door,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.990
you do not need to go down to the

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.510
station of the provincial

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.310
capital to then go to the station

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.190
of the other provincial capital

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.630
and then have to hole other

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.590
alternative means of transport.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.710
You do it all with one means of transport.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.490
Yes very clear.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.070
More variables you use?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.610
The third variable is the profit.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.350
And profit is exactly what people

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.330
are looking for.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.390
The fundamental benefits of blabla

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.990
car are, as I commented, the first

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.610
and most important is the point-

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.290
to-point and is that blabla car

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.970
is the most direct way to travel.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.370
It has locations that were

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.850
not so well connected before,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.230
thanks to blabla car they can

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.690
now be more connected.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.930
They can travel more directly

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.070
without having to use different

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.510
means of transport.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.250
We are moving from multimodality to single

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.270
use.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.450
There are people who the benefit they are

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.510
looking for is, it can coincide with what we

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.930
have said, the benefit they are looking for

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.930
is that with blabla car, what they are looking

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.350
for is to be able to travel to sites where

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.210
before they could not.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.610
and exact.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.130
That is a very specific benefit

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.490
that we are then inventing based on

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.650
that benefit and when you have it

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.810
identified you send messages there,

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.310
which is potentially great.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.270
actually is.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.570
It's associated with geography

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.950
can be too, but well, it doesn't

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.250
have to be always so.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.330
You can or can't, right.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.630
Another benefit can be the price

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.530
and is that, for example,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.150
the alternatives to travel if

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.890
you are a blabla car driver is

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.470
either driving alone or using

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.690
another means of transportation

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.150
such as bird, train, bus,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.530
plane, boat, etc.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.770
So the price often, the most

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.810
economical way to travel is

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.150
blabla car.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.830
and yes.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.730
And other benefits, even if

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.630
it seems a lie, can be, for

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.590
example, sustainability.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.070
It will seem like a very niche, but

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.370
we believe that we are really increasingly

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.390
aware and it is the

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.890
fact of making a more efficient

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.510
use of the vehicle and of taking

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.550
advantage of the resources.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.270
For we are becoming more and

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.390
more aware and in fact it is no longer

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.050
a consciousness but a social requirement,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.670
these goals we have,

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.930
for 2030.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.530
And we see it every time, especially

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.910
with the younger audience, we are

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.850
increasingly more aware and that

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.710
awareness makes it also one of the

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.110
benefits and that many people decide

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.430
to go in blabla car instead of

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.850
going alone in the car, because

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.290
precisely for that benefit.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.390
I always say it and I think that I

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.010
have already said it in the master

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.350
before, I am very supporter

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.630
of segmentation for benefit because

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.930
in the end I think it is the one that

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.510
best allows you to adapt, messages and

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.570
so on, because in the end there

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.890
will be many other geographical

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.050
and so on, but these you have told

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.530
us who makes it to save, who does it

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.970
to travel to sites where you could

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.730
not, who does it, as you say, for sustainability,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.290
etc., that are three very clear

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.710
benefits, especially the first

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.150
two, within these segments

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.810
you will have people of different

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.830
sociodemographic profiles,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.370
etc., but what most defines them

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.490
is that, is that they want that

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.870
with you, then if you talk to

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.110
them about that is potentissimo,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.310
I always think that is

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.570
segmentation.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.910
Yes, because it is the most direct

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.550
message and the one that will really

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.630
impact them.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.890
If you are 24 or 38 or 46,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.210
but if you want to save, I'm

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.470
talking about saving, it's

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.710
very powerful.
