00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.110
Let's talk about a growth movement,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570
a very common growth strategy

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.090
that is vertical integration

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.350
at once that you have to

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.170
understand well.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.430
Let us start with the concept.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.210
What is?

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.410
This is very clear when

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.490
we look at the supply chain.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.730
The supply chain mainly

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.410
before reaching the consumer

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.530
has four links that are

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.970
raw materials or commodities.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.030
There are usually some manufacturers

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.090
or producers.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.390
The wholesalers are

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.550
the wholesalers in English and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.830
the retailer is the distributor.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.510
There are some sectors where the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.530
wholesaler is called a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.270
distributor, etc., but there

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.190
are four lines and usually in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.910
almost all sectors the functions

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.330
of each of the lines are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.950
very similar and finally the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.830
consumer is reached at the end.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.810
Well, vertical integration

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.670
strategy is a move that takes

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.150
you to occupy within the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.610
supply chain more than

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850
a link but in particular

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.070
going backwards.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.990
In other words, by entering into the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.710
business of a supplier, for example.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710
It is usually done by inorganic

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.230
growth.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.770
It is often more common to buy

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.610
or merge with a supplier.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.330
Let's take examples because you will understand

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.130
it better.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.570
by Starbucks.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.470
He decides to start buying

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.630
coffee growers, coffee farms, as

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.390
they call him in English, in different

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.270
countries.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.690
by Netflix.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.690
Netflix is not only the platform

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.970
through which you access content,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.750
but also Netflix creates

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.430
its own content.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.830
by Amazon.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.730
similarly.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
Amazon has become a Mercadona

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.570
publisher.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.650
Mercadona's strategy with its interproviders,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.730
which we will analyze in

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.070
detail, could be considered

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.590
a vertical integration

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.730
backwards.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.390
Even if you do not buy from your suppliers,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.790
you establish very close relationships

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.050
with your suppliers.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.470
It goes backwards in the supply chain.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.850
What is important is that

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.450
we understand what the goals

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.030
or benefits of this type of

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.910
movement are.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.030
Let us take examples because they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.790
are better understood.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.270
Let's start with the example of Starbucks.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.390
What is Starbucks pursuing when it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.310
starts buying farms or coffee growers

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.690
in different countries around

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.350
the world?

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.090
Let us see.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.310
Let us reason.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.930
One is to ensure quality.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.910
As a manufacturer, you can

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.790
guarantee the quality you want.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.250
It does not depend on others.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.850
or to ensure supply.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.470
You have in mind that when you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.490
depend on suppliers, especially

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.910
in certain sectors, well,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.210
because there can be at

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.330
certain times, there can be shortages,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.490
etc.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.850
If you are the producer, you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.990
have absolute control, as we

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.850
said, on quality, on supply.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.530
In addition, there is an economic benefit

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.890
because obviously that producer

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.750
is applying a margin to the product,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.950
in this case, coffee.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.190
If you enter your supplier's business,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.150
that margin, as it is called,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.050
you capture it.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.550
Once you have captured that margin,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.790
you can choose to either make more

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.710
money or make more money throughout

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.670
the supply chain.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.450
You earn more money or what you could

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.170
do is impact that drop on the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.970
final price.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.410
This, for example, provides

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.830
a competitive advantage.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.030
The cost is more stable.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.490
Think that in many cases the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.570
commodity markets, well, because

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.690
they have some volatility

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.830
that can be permanently affecting

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.170
your income account and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.870
what you do by integrating

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.150
backwards is eliminating

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.750
that risk.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.650
Now we will analyze the case of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.930
Netflix or HBO, which are two

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.230
competitors with very similar

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.630
proposals and both have opted for

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.630
integrating backwards and for creating

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.350
content, movies, series, etc.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.770
In fact, the content they most disclose

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.410
and promote, for example, in

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.390
the case of Netflix with Narcos,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.310
are their own content.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.310
Let's see what are the reasons

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.510
that have led these two companies

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.930
to integrate backwards.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.790
Well, I think the most important

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.450
one is that they generate competitive

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.690
advantages and huge barriers to entry

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.850
into the traditional business, that

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.910
is, in your traditional business

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.010
I am referring to the Netflix or

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.130
HBO business.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.650
Why is it?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.970
Well, you think that if they are

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.890
able to control, to have exclusive

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.290
content, for example, like

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.750
Narcos, like the Narcos series

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.450
that has been a worldwide

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.930
surplus, it is a competitive

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.170
advantage.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.870
You are no longer dependent

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.730
on the content producers to license

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.510
it to you or to license

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.470
it to others, etc.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.870
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.270
The content is yours.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.570
And if that content is very good,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.890
obviously it is a competitive advantage.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.190
I have the same example of Netflix

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.530
and HBO, but similar is Amazon.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.830
Because Amazon, at the moment

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.770
it becomes a book publisher,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.990
generates a huge competitive

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.770
advantage.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.030
Because you have control over that

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.650
product, the control in exclusive.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.350
And in addition, the entry barrier

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.050
that Amazon has is very important

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.850
when it has, say, when

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.790
it has controlled much of the supply

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.890
chain.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.710
But another option is, another

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.610
benefit is that they can enter the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.530
business of their suppliers with

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.970
a huge competitive advantage.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.350
But now the competitive advantage, let's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.370
say it doesn't affect, I'm not thinking

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.990
about the competitive advantage in

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.830
the Netflix or HBO business of which

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.030
you are a customer.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.230
No, I'm thinking about the competitive

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.350
advantage as a producer of that content.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.470
Why is it?

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.850
Because if you are a content

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.170
producer, content that is usually

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.450
sold through platforms like

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.530
Netflix, but you are also

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.110
Netflix, that producer

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.350
has huge competitive advantages

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.590
because it has the insured

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.030
business.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.710
Let's think, let's compare two

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.650
producers who create a series

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.450
like Narcos, but one belongs

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.350
to Netflix.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.990
It is clear that the one that belongs

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.130
to Netflix has a huge competitive advantage.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.710
Therefore, as we have seen, two

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.330
of the common reasons to opt for backward

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.850
vertical integration are to generate

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.430
competitive advantages in the

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.470
traditional business or

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.590
generate competitive advantages

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.650
in the business of an earlier

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.830
link in the value chain that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.090
is the one you acquire.
