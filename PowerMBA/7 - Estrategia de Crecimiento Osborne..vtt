WEBVTT

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.270
We will analyze the evolution or

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.790
growth in the last decades of

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.250
an exemplary company like Osborne.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.390
Osborne is exemplary in many things.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.590
One of them is because it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.650
has managed to create a brand that

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.790
is truly iconic, it is a national symbol.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.750
Another is because it is a company

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.950
founded in 1774 and that still

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.210
belongs to the founding family and

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.290
has not done more than grow

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.970
since then.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.250
But well, what we're going to see

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.370
today is your more or less recent

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.070
growth strategy, right?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.450
The aim is to strengthen the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.350
knowledge learned.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.670
We will use the Igor

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.710
Ansov matrix.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.230
The Igor Ansov matrix

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650
represents the four

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.810
growth alternatives of

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.650
a company.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.750
Grow in your market, grow in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.510
the current market with new

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.130
products or head to new markets

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.570
or, finally, diversify,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.910
which is the most risky

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.410
option.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.570
We are going to be in

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.910
the 1900s, in the 1970s,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.930
right?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.450
Osborne, a company originating

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.070
in Porto Santa María, in southern

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.370
Spain, was very focused on brandy,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.850
it was its core product.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.550
And if we analyze the product

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.370
life cycle, another tool you should

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.950
know well, brandy at that time,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.170
and especially subsequently,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.910
has been entering the decline

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.090
phase.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.050
Sales, as the graph shows,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.130
have been declining.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.510
What happens?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.150
That if you are mainly in a declining

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.430
sector, you have to look for

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.810
other alternatives to growth

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.010
because the penetration in the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.450
market, which is the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.170
most logical, simpler,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.550
with less risk, is complicated

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.170
a lot.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.430
You won't grow up there.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.870
You have to choose others and let'

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.690
s see how Osborne has done

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.730
it from the 1970s to now.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.010
You have chosen to develop

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.870
products, to develop markets

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.570
and to diversify.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.470
The three alternatives of growth

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.490
have been successfully implemented.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.330
Let us start with the development

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.230
of products.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.570
Osborne has done what it did,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.990
starting from being a brand primarily

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.450
brandy, with a beverage, a type

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.110
of beverage, has been expanding

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.710
the range very much within the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.950
sector, especially of alcoholic

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.810
beverages.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.510
And how did he do it?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.450
This is done mainly

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.330
by two ways.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.290
One is inorganic growth.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.250
Remember, inorganic

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.670
growth is external growth.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.050
What Osborne has done has been to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.190
go buying companies or brands that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.570
have allowed him to have a wider,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.350
more varied offer.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.210
It has allowed him to enter the Rioja

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.450
wine or other designations of origin

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.830
or to buy a brand like Anís

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.910
del Mono.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.270
Or enter the gin sector,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.490
which has grown a lot in

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.190
recent years.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.650
In this case, buying

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.810
a Galician gin in 2015.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.630
The beer has also grown a lot

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.650
and Osborne wanted to take

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.590
advantage of that growth.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.230
And what he has done is a strategic

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.730
alliance with a brewery

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.610
company, brewery.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.350
And now it has two brands like

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.690
this that we have on the boxer'

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.290
s screen.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.850
And a brand of beer with Osborne'

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.290
s own brand, with Toro.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.630
As we can see, he has developed

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.490
his product in an organic way, buying.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.010
But, and this is very important, and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.450
it started to do it in the 1970s.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.370
It was a great success, it was

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.250
a very good decision.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.610
Osborne decided not only to incorporate

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.930
into its range of products, brands

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.670
or products.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.630
Acquired by Osborne, but

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.290
become a third-party brand

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.330
distributor.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.050
This is what we call vertical

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.110
integration forward, you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.310
should understand this concept

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.890
well.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.230
You will see it by looking at

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.910
the value chain.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.370
If we draw the value chain of the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.970
wine sector, everything is born of the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.190
raw material, which in this case is

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.770
grapes.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.910
There is a producer, in this case the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.530
producer is Osborne, it is the cellar.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.170
There is a distributor or

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.090
wholesaler who sells these

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.110
bottles to retailers.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.550
It can be from a supermarket

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.930
to a bar, to a hotel.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.950


00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.410
Now we are coming to the consumer.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.030
Osborne in the value chain is in

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.790
the second stage that is the producer.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.530
But what he decided was to become

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.130
not just a producer, not just

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.410
a cellar.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.710
In a distributor, in a distributor.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.230
Both their own and third-party trademarks.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.870


00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.570
This allows you to grow much faster.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.430
It also allows you to incorporate

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.310
brands like Red Bull for example.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.370
He was Red Bull's official

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.610
distributor in Spain for

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.670
a few years.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.910
It is finished.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.030
Brockmans, Geneva, Fever Tree, Tonica,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.330
Ron Santa Teresa, etc.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.950
What you have now is a...

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.150
These are not all the brands you have,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.130
they are part of the brands.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.890
But what you have a huge portfolio

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.530
of alcoholic beverages.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.130
Part of which are owned trademarks,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.930
property acquired by Osborne,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.850
acquired or licensed by Osborne.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.870
And in some cases what they are are

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.810
brands that Osborne distributes.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.490
Is it worth?

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.050
Now, let's go to the second of the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.310
alternatives of growth.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.030
You have, as we see Osborne,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.150
a very large portfolio.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.470
It is very logical to go out and try

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.490
to sell in new geographical markets.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.030
to go out.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.470
It is present in 53 countries

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.850
and 30% of its sales are overseas.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.770


00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.470
This is very common in the industry,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.010
right?

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.430
I will tell you one.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.610
Osborne wanted to go to China.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.090
Usually if you want to enter China

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.410
or in complicated geographical

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.910
markets what you do is a strategic

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.050
alliance with a company

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.790
there.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.250
It's a trade ally, right?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.890
A youth or anything.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.470
In contrast, Osborne did in 2014

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.110
an agreement with a very powerful

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.710
Chinese investor group, Fosun.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.490
But it was curious because Osborne didn'

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.550
t enter, didn't do a YoInventure in China.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.210
What he did is, Fosun acquired 20%

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.790
of the shares of the parent company.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.990
The Matrix in Spain.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.630
This allowed Osborne to

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.930
capitalize to make some powerful

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.410
acquisition.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.970
And he also won, say, a Chinese partner

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.110
that would allow him to enter

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.770
China strongly.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.210
Well, this was overthrown two years

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.170
later and Osborne recovered that 20%.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.770
But Fosun remains a Chinese

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.690
trade ally that helps Osborne

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.890
grow in China.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.850
Another way to develop your

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.850
market, to get out to new markets,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.710
is not to go abroad, but

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.570
to get new customer elements

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.470
for your current products.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.370
Osborne tried it.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.210
He said his product was

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.130
brandy.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.730
Who are the brandy

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.850
buyers?

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.710
People of middle age.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.890
And in decline.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.430
In decline the sales of the Brandy,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.690
as I commented, in decline

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.870
since the 1970s.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.210
Osborne tried to increase or

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.690
encourage demand for brandy

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.890
among young people by associating

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.610
the brandy with a combined,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.050
cup, night, etc.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.870
drink.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.490
He created the Toro brand.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.170
But it did not have excessive success.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.750
And we go to the last of the

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.810
strategic alternatives that is

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.670
diversification.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.150
This is the one that carries the most risk.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.110
But he did it with quite success.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.890
For example, it has entered the

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.030
bottled water, mineral water

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.810
sector.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.370
He acquired a stake in Solán

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.770
de Cabras which he later sold to

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.790
the San Miguel Group.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.310
But during those years the brand Solán

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.490
de Cabras was greatly strengthened

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.090
and grew enormously.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.930
It is currently in the

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.730
food industry.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.870
Because it is the owner of two

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.830
brands of the most well-known of

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.450
Jamón Ibérico.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.130
And another very clear

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.650
example of diversification,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.710
even less related, is the entry,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.870
is that it is currently

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.030
owner of a 5J restaurant

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.890
chain.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.290
You see it is far away,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.190
right?

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.290
It is less related, there are fewer

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.010
synergies between a restaurant

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.170
chain and its traditional

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.270
alcoholic beverage business.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.030
Well, to finish, as we have

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.910
seen, Osborne, a company founded

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.970
in 1700.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.050
It has only grown since

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.770
its birth and in the 1970s

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.410
faces a complex situation

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.010
because its main product

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.350
enters a decline

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.370
phase.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.490
So you have to choose other

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.710
growth alternatives, right?

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.970
And as I have told you, it chooses

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.070
to expand its range of products

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.090
and has a huge portfolio, as we

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.810
have seen.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.570
Some are own because they have bought them

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.130
and others are not, others are...

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.850
He is the distributor of these products.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.710
From brands like Geneva Procmans,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.190
for example.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.910
He has opted, as is logical in

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.990
the sector and as have done all

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.170
the companies to go out to foreign

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.970
markets and has sold a 30%, and

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.850
also, as it has been a company

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.750
traditionally with very good

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.650
results and strongly

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.050
capitalized, has allowed him

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.470
to invest in more distant.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.090
A diversification strategy, such

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.630
as entering Solán de Cabras or

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.790
as in Jamón Ibérico or as a chain

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.790
of restaurants.
