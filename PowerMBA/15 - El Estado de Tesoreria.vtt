00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.930
In this class we will see how the

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.970
treasury state is created, which

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.730
if you remember is one of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.170
the main financial statements,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.230
it is the third one we will see.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.330
This is the structure of the treasury

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.190
state.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.610
It consists of three different

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.130
flows, the one of operations, the other

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.950
of investment and the other of financing.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.930
In the previous class we have already

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.330
seen that represents each or each

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.590
of the three main activities

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.210
of a company.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510
Operations, Investment and Finance.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.830
In this case, the treasury

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.210
state helps us to analyze a company

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.290
from this perspective, creating

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.830
a cash flow for each

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.530
of them.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.050
We start with the operations.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.770
The cash flow of operations

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.770
is what we do to move from

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.570
net profit or the outcome

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.590
of the exercise to a cash

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.910
flow.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490
We have to make the adjustments to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.610
convert a magnitude that is

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.730
accountable, which does not represent

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.910
the reality of treasury movements

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.610
into a cash flow.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.230
We will make two types of adjustments.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.630
First, we will add the amortisation.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.240
As you can see, we start with

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.520
the net profit and add the amortisations.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.740
Why do we add amortisations?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.100
You should already know.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.720
Amortisations do not mean a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240
treasury exit.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620
That is, when we previously

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.240
calculated in the results

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.760
report the net profit, which

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.360
is here, $73,600, we had

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.400
deducted the amortisations.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.900
But keep in mind that we have subsidized

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.920
the amortisations but those

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.400
8,000 euros have not come out

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.300
of the box at any time.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380
So, to turn it into a cash

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.660
flow we have to re-

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.780
sum them.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.560
As we see here, we have added the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.740
amortisations again.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.380
This is the first of the adjustments.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.240
We have to continue making

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.360
adjustments to convert the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.140
profit into a cash flow.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.160
To convert net profit into cash

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.300
flow we have to make a second

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.000
block of adjustments.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.700
We have already made amortisations.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.340
Well, now we have to make

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.220
adjustments corresponding to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.080
variations in current assets

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.040
and liabilities.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.200
I will explain it to you.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.000
I return to the essence.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.200
The point is that income is not

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.300
the same as collection.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.160
There are incomes that are not charged

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.060
and expenses are not the same as payments.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.800
There are expenses that are not paid.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.780
We must make all the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.460
appropriate adjustments.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.000
We have to identify the income

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520
we have not collected and the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.500
expenses we have not paid.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, back to the current assets

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.980
and passives.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.240
The games that are in this

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.380
case are the games that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.660
are in yellow.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.980
The assets and liabilities

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.680
of the transactions related

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.960
to revenue and expenses.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.660
I will give you an example of each

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.760
one so you can understand.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.200
We start with the customers.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.840
What we have is an income.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.080
We have a sales income that goes

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.900
to results.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.240
This increases net

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.020
profit by $100,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.720
000.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360
But we did not charge it.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.660
Instead of increasing the treasury

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.580
account or bank account.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
Increase the customer account.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.000
It is an active account, a current

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.780
asset account.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.440
But we did not charge.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.940
So if we want to convert

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.900
net profit into cash flow.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.020
We must bear in mind that those

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.480
100,000 have not yet entered.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.080
Therefore, they will have to be retained.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.910
The opposite is true of suppliers.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.230
In this case, we will see a cost that

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.090
does not involve a payment.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.610
We have a purchase cost.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.090
We bought goods.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.970
for a value of $100,000.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.270
We have calculated

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.770
the net profit.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.670
We have not paid the provider.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.590
As you can see, the balance is complete.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.510
Suppliers $100,000

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.310
This is a cost that has not

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.790
resulted in a cash out.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.970
Then we will have to adjust it.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.830
We will have when we calculate to calculate

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.990
the cash flow of the transactions.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.350
We will have to add it.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.090
to correct it.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.530
Finally, we will look at the stocks.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.090
I will explain how it works.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.970
The change in stock at the

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.890
end of the year is a positive

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.650
result.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.170
We consider it an income.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.870
However, it should be noted that it has not

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.670
resulted in an increase in the amount of money.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.450
We must adjust it in the same way.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.090
We have an income that has not increased

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.310
the balance of the cash.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.650
This increased the balance of another

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.070
asset.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.010
We must therefore retain it.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.090
And here we have, we see again in

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.730
the state of treasury.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.850
We see it.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.190
We have to restore the increases

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.570
in current assets.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.270
They are made from income that

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.850
has not generated an increase in

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.450
treasury.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.610
This has led to an increase

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.310
in the asset.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.930
Customers or stocks.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.630
We need to increase

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.230
the current liabilities.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.410
The account of suppliers has increased.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.690
We have to add it.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.990
We consider it a cost.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.190
This has reduced net

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.050
profit.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.930
There was no exit from treasury.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.660
We go to the second of the streams.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.080
The cash flow of investment.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.980
This is very simple.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.020
All we have to do is

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.960
add and rest.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.780
All movements corresponding

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.120
to investments in fixed

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.500
assets.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.240
They usually buy fixed assets.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.580
Imagine a building, a machine.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.800
Invest in software.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.980
In some cases, it is devalued

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.980
and produces a treasury

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.900
entry.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.060
The third cash flow is

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.260
from funding.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.520
In this case, we need

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.260
to add and rest.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.660
The movements related to the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.980
two sources of funding.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.780
What are the sources of financing?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040
The debt or the partners.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.460
Let's start with debt.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.500
We have a few debt tickets.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.680
When we get a loan enters the box,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.520
enters the treasury in the company.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.560
Amortisation is the opposite.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.280
These are payments, the returns.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.680
For the partners, it is a bit

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.660
similar.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.280
The contributions of the partners.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.600
Social capital, capital

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.760
expansion, etc.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.120
This increases the amount of money

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.340
that is available in the company.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.040
It is summed up, of course.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400
The outputs are dividend payments.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.440
That we decrease in

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.080
that amount every year.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.860
We have seen how the treasury

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.000
state is created.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.320
There are three types of operations,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.480
investment and financing.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.320
We calculate separately.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.240
Add the three flowers.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.100
It tells us about the cash flow of the period.
