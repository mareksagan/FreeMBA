WEBVTT

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.400
Today we are with Carlos, who

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640
is another of our students, and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680
not only a student, but a collaborator

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.480
of The Power MBA who is helping

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.640
us with all the production

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.440
of audiovisual content.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.580
And the topic that we were concerned

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.440
with is that we will do an analysis

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.280
of Carlos's company, of Overs, of the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.360
audiovisual producer.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.400
We will use the tool we are

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.620
using usually, which

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.560
is the Business Model Canvas,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.340
and after doing the analysis

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.600
what we will try is to identify

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800
some possible evolution.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.520
Carlos has some idea about how to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.560
evolve his business, which I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.640
don't think he'll tell us because

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.940
he doesn't want to reveal it.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200
We will share some cakes.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.700
The first thing I will do is...

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.780
Well, Carlos, thank you very much

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.560
for being with us.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.360
The first thing I will do...

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.520
and Hello.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.900
I'll ask you a few questions about

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.140
how your business model works and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.640
I'll fill out the Business Model

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.400
Canvas, right?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.740
First I want you to tell me.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.380
Who are your customers, your customer

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.560
segments in a very concise way and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.860
what do you offer them?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.780
well is.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.780
Our main clientele or targeting

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.540
goes from companies that not

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.320
only want to promote their brand

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.900
or brand philosophy,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.980
but also product, to boyfriends

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.280
who get married or events

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120
videos, making party movies

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.540
and advertising productions

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.540
in general.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.040
This is part of the video, we also

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.340
take pictures.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.160
Tell me.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.460
So, we talk that customer

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.200
segments are companies that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.500
you make videos, I imagine

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.040
different types of marketing,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.500
especially people you hire

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.060
marketing, right?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.780
It is for marketing.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.520
We are an exceptional case.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.520
Well, we are a company, an educational

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.080
institution for product, but

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.740
it will be exceptional.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.880
The brides...

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.180
It depends.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.760
Do you know how I say?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.700
There are companies that want

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.540
to promote their brand or theirs,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.500
as in your case, the philosophy

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.480
for which they work or a product.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.920
For example, we've now worked with

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.100
an optics that we sold their glasses

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.440
with different qualities.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.720
There were children's glasses, sports glasses, and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.900
they asked us to develop advertising

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.380
that would be a great deal of a good thing.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.560
Okay, but it is advertising.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.880
That of the consumer is

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.160
advertising, on the one hand, as I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.760
tell you, and on the other hand,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.360
because of video catering, events,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.220
presentations, interviews, as in

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.300
some of your case.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.660
and yes.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.100
Or generally any kind of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.140
video production you ask us, or

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760
3D animation for video screens,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.560
all the effects of everything.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.480
And then, on the other hand,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.560
photography, even event photography,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.920
wedding, studio and graphic

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.900
design.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.440
and great.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.420
Same with graphic design.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.640
very clearly.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.060
What is the distribution channel?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.040
I will ask you the question in a different way.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.260
How do you capture customers?

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.930
Because given the amount of work

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.070
we have now, the amount of work

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.170
we have, we have not been able

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.750
to invest all the time the money

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.490
we want in online advertising.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.030
For example, on Facebook, on social

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.290
media, or even with our

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.970
website.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.990
We haven't been able to invest

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.370
a lot of time in that, and the main

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.410
customers we have now come from

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.150
mouth to mouth.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.570
well is.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.390
I loved your video, I saw your video

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.910
on I don't know where, but not

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.470
a direct promotion on our part.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.350
The typical.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.570
How do you relate to customers

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.330
through pages on social media,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.950
Instagram or something like that?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.810
Yes, we try to keep them alive,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.070
but many times it is

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.190
complicated considering the amount

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.010
of work we have now.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.290
and Genius.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.950
You are saturated, upset

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.830
and do not do the things you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.970
know you have to do.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.330
Of course, that is, we close ourselves

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.750
more to working, rather than to promote

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.590
our own brand.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.730
Well well well well.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.770
How do you charge?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.370
How is the income flow?

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.110
Explain it.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.310
By project?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.940
Especially in the digital

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.060
world, each project is different.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.980
Each project has different

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.880
needs and attacks and has

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.140
a different size and application.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.120
well is.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.720
We don't have a model, for example, of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.580
watching videos to 300, or watching

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.080
video to X, because each project,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.760
each video is a different project.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.800
Well well, very well.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.260
What are the key activities of your

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.940
business?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.100
What do you spend your time with?

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.420
Man, the main thing for videos that

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.100
require to be recorded is recording,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.600
because with theme of lighting,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.020
sound and everything else.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.940
And then editing are the key points

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.560
and the base points for any project,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.740
for example, in video.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.300
Then comes the pre-production and I don't

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.280
know.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.500
Well to edit.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.600
First record and then edit.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.740
And another idea that has to be another

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.340
that is to capture customers, but good.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.960
Well, what are the key resources

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.320
you need for your business

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.600
model?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.540
What is that you need?

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.720
First, you need a lot of

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840
money to invest in the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.180
entire project.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.520
In our case, we did it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.740
through work.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.120
We started to generate money

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.200
and to invest it in material

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.540
through work, gradually,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.380
growing a lot.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.760
And so we have been able to invest more

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.220
and more, more and more, with more

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.100
work and more material.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.020
Material is OK?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.400
Material and how much?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.800
Well, well, you don't need to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.960
quantify, but effectively for

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.760
your business model you need

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.360
cameras, you need, well, a lot

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.980
of things.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.260
And there is another key resource

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.600
that is people, that you are, that

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.880
is a resource yet that is more

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.200
valuable than material and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.220
then we will analyze it.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.840
The cost structure is not

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.580
to be asked.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.360
It is the material and the salary.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.180
There is no more.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.700
well is.
