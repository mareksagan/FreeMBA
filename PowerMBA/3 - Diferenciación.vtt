00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.990
Let's talk about the differentiation strategy.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.230
It is important that you understand very

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.330
well what it consists of and how

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.070
to carry it out.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.890
As you can see, Porter said there

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.790
are two sources of competitive advantage.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.610
The first is the low cost and the low cost,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.390
which we have seen.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.550
And, on the other hand, to find differentiation.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.450
And in addition, you can look

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.550
for differentiation in all

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.850
market segments or you can

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.970
sit in a niche, in a particular

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.810
segment.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.350
It is important to understand

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.290
the criteria for a segmentation

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.390
strategy.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.430
And the main criterion is that you

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.970
have to identify some factor

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.190
in which you have to be the best.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.630
You don't have to be the best in everything,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.970
right?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.650
You have to identify a factor

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.050
you have to focus on, be very

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.190
good and your customers value

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.050
it, right?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.910
That's what will allow you to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610
successfully implement the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.890
differentiation strategy.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.490
Customers need to value it and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.530
they have to be willing to

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.310
pay for it.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.070
It is important that you transmit at

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.330
a higher price because you have

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.250
to keep in mind that usually to be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.570
good at something, to be better than

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.450
others, you'll have to invest

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.870
more than others.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.610
This usually leads to a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.690
higher cost structure.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.910
Therefore, it has to be transmitted

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.910
at a higher price.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.290
As we said, the differentiation

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.390
strategy can be carried out in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870
all segments of the market and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.770
you will understand it well

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.710
with an example.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090
The Mercedes Benz.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370
Mercedes Benz has compact cars,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.830
has all-terrain cars, has family

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.050
members, has sports

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.070
cars, etc.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.490
We have cars for all segments.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.010
It is a competition in differentiation.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.150
Customers choose Mercedes

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.010
not by price, but by

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.770
brand, car characteristics,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.810
etc.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.550
However, in the same sector there

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.230
are companies that play in

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.870
differentiation but in small niches.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.990
A good example would be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.770
Ferrari.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.170
Ferrari is only aimed at people with

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.170
a lot of money and also those who

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.570
are lovers of the engine and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.370
speed, etc.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.170
What is the key to this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.790
strategy of focusing on a small

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.970
segment like Ferrari?

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.910
If you want to have a competitive advantage

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.130
in that segment, because it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.170
is easier for you to know

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.330
that niche very well with which

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.970
you have a very close relationship.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.990
For Ferrari it is easier

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.550
to meet the needs of its target

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.150
audience, of these people with

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.930
a lot of money than for Mercedes.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.070
Mercedes is more focused,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.890
it is in all segments.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750
Let's see what are the benefits

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.250
of the differentiation strategy

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.630
over the low cost, because

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.470
it has some benefits.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070
I think there is one very important to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.530
understand and is that when you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.690
compete in differentiation, in principle

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.510
your competition, the competitive

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.830
struggle will be less.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.510
And the more differentiated you are,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.550
the less.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.130
You will also be aware of the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.310
automotive industry.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.670
We will compare the case of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.830
the super-luxury car segment

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.070
as could be in this case Ferrari

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.590
and Lamborghini.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.210
And on the other hand there is a normal

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.370
car segment in which very

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.210
many brands compete and we will put

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.690
ourselves in the skin of a buyer.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.130
If you are going to buy a

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.390
normal car of 30,000 euros, imagine

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.890
a SUV of 30,000 euros, what

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.630
you do is usually compare

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.390
all brands, compare

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.970
prices, compare

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.070
features, etc.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890
It is a very rational process in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.610
which you have a lot of information

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.510
and in which all brands are

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.010
competing for you, offer you

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.030
discounts, etc.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.970
Now, let's go to the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.510
sports car buyer.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.410
The decision is different and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.790
the competition between manufacturers

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.630
is different.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.410
Lamborghini and Ferrari do not compete

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.750
with offers, etc.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.690
Why is?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.270
The Ferrari is the Ferrari,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.370
the Lamborghini is the Lamborghini,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.230
and the Ferrari is

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.670
the Lamborghini.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.490
All this makes the margin, as

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.870
your differentiation is greater,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.010
your margin usually usually

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.050
is greater.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.510
Because the customer is less

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.430
price sensitive and because you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.450
wear less in the competitive

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.850
struggle with the rest.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.150
Another factor that is consequence is that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.370
you usually have more loyal customers.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.390
As you get more differentiated,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.450
you usually have more

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.230
loyal customers.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.430
And if we go to the opposite,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.410
to the absolute commodity, customers

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.770
are very unfaithful, as we

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.850
talked in the low cost strategy.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.510


00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.490
If you buy a cheap one, you will be

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.350
able to buy the cheapest one, right?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.870
And finally, to understand the strategy

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.130
of differentiation well, when

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.630
does it make sense to opt for differentiation?

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.410
Well, in principle, it is something

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.150
you should already understand because

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.230
we study it in external analysis, in

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.710
principle it makes more sense, there

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.270
is more space for differentiation

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.430
in some sectors than in

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.150
others.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.830
There are sectors that are more diverse.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.530
We will go to an extreme case also,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.170
in the case of the sector that is

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.770
not differentiated, the commoditized

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.870
sector, such as the raw

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.670
materials.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.210
Well, if there are many competitors

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.170
offering wood, for example, the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.690
differentiation is very low and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.170
there is little space for differentiation

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.350
because they all offer the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.250
same and basically because

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.430
the customer wants to pay

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.990
the lowest price, usually.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.590
There is very little room for

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.430
differentiation.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.450
And now let's compare it to a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.530
sector, for example, that of

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.810
luxury watches.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.070
The space for differentiation

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.510
is maximum in this

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.990
case.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.730
The customer is looking for something else,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.030
it is a brand, it is design, it is

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.110
prestige, etc.
