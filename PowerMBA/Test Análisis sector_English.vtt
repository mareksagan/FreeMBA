WEBVTT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
We are going to get the answers to the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.980
external analysis test.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.420
Who is the author of the five forces?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.740
Well, I hope you know this.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.500
It is Michael Porter.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.060
The five forces are a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.280
tool that serves us for what?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.520
It is used to measure the

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.140
profitability of a sector.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.050
According to Porter, there is one force

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.410
that is central and is a consequence

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.210
of the other four.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.390
Well, since the central force

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.830
is competitive rivalry and

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.930
the rest of forces, the threats

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.370
of substitute products, of new

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.710
competitors, the power of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.550
suppliers and the power of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.630
buyers, what they have is an

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.730
impact on competitive rivalry.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.730
Let’s think about the food

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.590
distribution sector.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.290
Here is the supply chain.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.250
We will look at the power of the suppliers.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.350
We put ourselves in the situation

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.290
of a food distributor, of a supermarket,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.590
for example.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.350
What is the power of suppliers?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.970
Does it affect the profitability

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.430
of the sector negatively

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.810
or positively?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.090
It affects in a positive way.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.610
Why is?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.790
Because you have hundreds or thousands

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.070
of providers that are much smaller

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130
than you, that depend on you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.950
and therefore you are in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.510
a dominant position over them.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.830
That allows you to tighten and, after

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.010
all, what impacts is in a positive

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.750
way on profitability.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.530
But now we will put ourselves from the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.030
producer’s point of view rather than

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.810
the distributor’s.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.190
And here the situation is the opposite.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.390
The profits are very low.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.610
They are so low because of what?

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.570
Because their customers,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.410
i.e. distributors, supermarkets

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.270
have a lot of power over

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.290
them.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.070
Because they are more concentrated,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.010
they are actually more concentrated,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.550
there are thousands of producers

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.250
and dozens or hundreds of

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.190
distributors.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.670
And usually, also because in the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.970
sector of the producers of raw

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.830
materials or of this type of products,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.870
the offers are very commoditized,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.010
that is, they are all very similar,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.430
except the large brands, the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.850
very recognized brands, well,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.590
because they have more

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810
differentiated proposals.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.190
Thus, all three are correct.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.890
The barrier, what do you do?

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.870
Increase or decrease competitive warfare.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.150
What they do is increase

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.810
it, because companies that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.930
are within the sector cannot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.990
get out and are forced

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.950
to compete harder.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.450
The entrance barriers, what do they do?

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.370
Increase or decrease competitive warfare.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.810
They are diminishing it because

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.910
the companies that are inside

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.650
benefit from those barriers or

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.550
those advantages and are

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.310
not forced to compete so cruelly.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.930
Entrance barriers increase

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.790
or decrease profitability.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.890
Clearly, entry barriers

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.530
increase the profitability

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.510
of a sector.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.970
In the comforted sectors, is the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.950
competitive war greater or lesser?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.390
If all the proposals

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.150
are very similar, the competitive

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.490
war is greater.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.610
There are more price wars, etc.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.400
In sectors where there are high costs

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.860
of change, what are they generating?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.360
High entry barriers or low

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.020
entry barriers?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.200
High entrance barriers.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.300
Businesses in the sector

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.860
benefit from high entry

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.840
barriers.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.380
If the customer sector, that is,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.220
if the sector you are selling

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.320
to is very concentrated,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.880
that is, there are few companies

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.060
that have a large share of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.200
the market and are very powerful,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.080
how does this affect profitability

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.580
in your sector?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.660
In a positive or a negative way?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.580
It clearly affects negatively.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.640
When your customers are very

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.800
large, they are bigger than you and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.640
they are very powerful, your customers

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.400
have a lot of power over you, so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.460
they will tighten you on the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.980
margins, decreases profitability.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.420
Walmart is often cited as

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.320
an example of building entry

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.820
barriers, why?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.880
It has always been an example

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.600
of economies of scale.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.460
What is the main factor contributing

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.420
to the generation of entry

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.580
barriers for YouTube?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.440
The investments that are needed

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.600
to put you at the level of YouTube,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.220
regulatory protection or network

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.700
economies or the network effect

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.520
that has been generated after so many

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.960
years of having millions of users

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.840
and especially having millions

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.400
and millions and millions of videos

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.340
uploaded.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.640
Well, because clearly the entry

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.280
barrier is due to the network

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.760
effect as well as in the rest of platforms.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.760
And for a hotel company like Hilton,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.140
what do you think is the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.120
main barrier to entry?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.900
The investment, regulatory

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.160
protection or network effect.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.240
What is it that discourages

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.740
competition from new competitors

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.820
to compete with large hotel chains?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.500
The huge investment

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.820
that is needed.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.660
What is the second phase of the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.320
life cycle?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.040
of growth.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.220
At what stage do competitors start to enter?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.800
In the growth phase.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.520
Encouraged by rising profitability

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.720
and why a growing market

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.660
tends to enter more competitors

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.000
in this phase.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.680
In the first phase, in the introductory

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.820
phase, cash flows are usually

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.220
positive or negative.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.840
Cash flows are

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.440
usually negative.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.280
You have to invest in product

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.420
development, you have to

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.500
invest in customer capture,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.420
etc.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.850
At what stage of the life cycle

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.170
do companies start to benefit

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.150
from economies of scale that

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.870
allow them to decrease unit costs?

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.730
The growth of the economy is

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.490
usually in the maturity phase.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.830
When companies stop growing,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.930
they seek efficiency and benefit

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.270
from those economies.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.200
In the growth phase, investment

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.600
in customer capture has a higher

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.940
return than in the maturity

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.580
phase.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.120
Is this correct or not?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.820
Yes, it is true.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.160
Keep in mind that in the growth phase

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.800
there is still a lot of market,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.900
there is still a lot of cake.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.340
However, in the maturity phase,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.840
the market no longer grows.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.620
So you, to win customers, to

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.500
win market share, you have

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.220
to steal your competitors.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.600
Therefore, investing in growing

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.140
in the growth phase is much

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.340
more profitable.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.400
The fashion sector is very

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.520
concentrated due to large

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.620
groups such as Inditex, HEM, Megap,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.200
etc.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.000
They have a market share of

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.220
more than 50%.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.220
Well, as we saw with NestorHub,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.040
this is false.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.640
Despite being very large companies

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.060
with billions of dollars

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.380
in turnover, their weight over

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.800
the total sector remains very low.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.320
The fashion industry is still

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.960
a very poorly concentrated

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.520
sector.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.580
We are seeing a growing trend

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.220
in almost all sectors.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.620
to what?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.320
Are the sectors increasingly fragmented

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.640
or are the sectors increasingly

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.480
concentrated?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.200
We are seeing that almost

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.880
all sectors are concentrated.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.100
It is increasingly necessary to be

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.080
bigger to be competitive.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.480
What about the car manufacturers?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.380


00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.960
Is it concentrated or fragmented?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.200
He is very concentrated.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.800
It is in the hands of a few groups

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.380
that are very large and that

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.400
have a total market share.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.040
The greater the differentiation or

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.020
atomization in a sector, the greater

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.160
the profitability.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.700
In areas where the differentiation

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.780
is higher, the profitability

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.980
is higher.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.640
I will explain quickly

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.080
why.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.620
We will put ourselves in the opposite case.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.640
In the sectors where they are

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.640
very commoditized, all competitors

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.800
have a very similar value

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.600
proposition.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.900
They must compete in

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.420
price.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.140
This makes the profitability

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.140
lower.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.640
If, on the other hand, you

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.120
are very different or all competitors

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.180
are very different from each other,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.000
and customers do what they do is

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.100
choose a company or another based

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.500
on their preference, this allows

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.960
companies not to have to

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.980
adjust to very low margins.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.600
PEST is a tool that allows us to

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.740
analyze a series of factors

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.900
over which we do not have capacity

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.380
for action.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.800
The correct answer is A.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.660
And they are not factors related to the

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.520
sector, they are external, political,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.140
economic, social and technological factors.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.260
PEST refers to strategic,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.080
economic or environmental

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.440
factors, clearly economic.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.800
Changes in consumer habits

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.160
are taken into account in social

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.720
factors, correctly.
