WEBVTT

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.470
We will analyze what are the advantages,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.070
because there are very clear advantages,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.030
of choosing a segmentation

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.430
or niche strategy with respect

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.330
to competitors who opt for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.570
the entire market.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.970
Well, I think there is one

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.850
main one, and from which almost

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.750
all the others derive, and that you,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.990
by focusing, by focusing, have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.370
a greater knowledge of that

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.790
niche.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.130
You know much more about customers,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.090
their needs, what moves them, their

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.010
challenges, their problems,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.230
etc., and from this, because many

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.970
advantages are generated.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.390
The example of Decathlon.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.150
Decathlon offers all the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
products, but the bike store knows

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.110
the cyclist perfectly what

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.610
he likes, etc., what he demands.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.830
It is clear that the customer’s

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.170
knowledge is much greater.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.930
This allows you to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.210
have more adapted products.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.530
You can adapt your proposal to that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.170
niche, and you are much more flexible.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.670
I’m putting the example of a software

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.690
manufacturer that has focused,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.210
a recent company that is growing

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.270
a lot, that has focused

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.690
on software for restaurants,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.610
mainly for shopping.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.590
It is clear that it has opted

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.930
for a segmentation strategy against

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.770
the large software manufacturers

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.930
that play mainly differentiation

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.010
and are present on all

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.510
verticals.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.650
It is clear that for G-stock

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.290
to have developed a product that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.130
satisfies the needs of restaurants

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.970
much more effectively is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.230
very easy because it knows

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.690
the restaurants very well.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.970
Not only can you create a better

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.150
product, but it’s also that you

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.390
can, it’s easier to market it.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.150
It’s easier to get to when your

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.150
customer segment is very specific,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.870
it’s much more efficient to get

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.170
to that customer segment in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.370
marketing issues.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.650
You can better choose the channels,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.170
know where they are, address

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.030
them much more specifically,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.730
etc.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.810
I’ll give you an example of a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.490
company, from a friend of mine,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.210
a real estate advisor, traditionally

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.330
in a hostel.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.330
He decided to move from a generalist

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.090
strategy, he was aiming with

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.950
all products to all segments

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710
to focus on a niche and has

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.150
gone much better.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.850
For many reasons, because it offers

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.110
more value, because it knows its market

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.510
very well, its target audience

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.890
and among others also because

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.170
marketing, capture is much

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.150
more effective.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.810
He has to catch hostels now.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.170
From that, segmentation, the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.470
channels you can use, etc.,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.290
is much simpler than if you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.050
had to, like any real estate

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.590
advisor or real estate

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.490
agency that has to use

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.210
real estate portals,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.230
indifferent and so on.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.190
I think it is easy to understand.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.490
Another advantage is that it is very

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.910
common that in this type of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.190
strategy the fidelization of customers

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.550
is much greater.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.950
I’ll put you a classic case of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.110
niche strategy, which is a sastre.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.890
A sastre competes with clothing

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.130
manufacturers, with the big

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.670
brands, whether they play to differentiation

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.710
or cost or whatever, but the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.830
sastre is clear that it competes

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.710
in a niche and customer loyalty

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.270
is maximum.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.730
Customers are all their lives in the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.270
same sink that has your measurements.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.750
You already understand the difference.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.530
Another of the main advantages

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.970
is that usually, especially

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.710
when you compete in differentiation

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.870
within a niche, the customer

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.550
price sensitivity is much lower

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.730
and ultimately allows you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.170
to have higher prices and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.530
that the margins are much

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.550
larger.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.730
The margins of a company like Ferrari

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.510
are much higher than of a company

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.530
like Mercedes.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.170
The margins are much higher, in

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.030
principle, that applies a specialized

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.770
bike store than Decathlon.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.450
Because you choose Decathlon for the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.610
price, for the cheap.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.730
The bike shop is not

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.530
cheap.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.490
You choose her because she is the only

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.950
one who is able to, if you are

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.250
a big fan of bicycling, she is the only

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.810
one who is able to understand your needs.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.550
You know the professionals,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.470
etc.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.610
They give you much more value.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.870
Your price sensitivity

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.790
is much lower.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.970
In addition, another advantage is that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.310
when you focus on a niche, it’

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.870
s much easier to reach a leadership

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.490
position within that

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.890
niche.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.310
Obviously it is much easier.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.230
I’ll give you an example of a craft

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.230
beer centered, in addition,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.810
in a geographical area within

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.730
Spain that would acquire a strong

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.510
leadership position within

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.110
that market, from that small

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.910
niche.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.170
This ultimately creates barriers

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.070
to entry.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.630
The same entry barriers that a competitor

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.950
that has leadership generates,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.810
a monopoly at a level, because

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.630
that, throughout the market,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.950
niche competitors end up getting

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.310
it within their niches.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.170
This is a huge advantage in your

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.970
business model.
