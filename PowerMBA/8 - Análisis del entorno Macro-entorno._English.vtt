00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.680
Pesta analysis is a tool

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.140
that serves us to do an analysis

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.380
or an external diagnosis of the

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.260
environment in which the company

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.020
moves.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.180
It is a very useful tool to identify

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.260
what are the political,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.520
economic, social and technological

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.960
factors that affect in one

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.620
way or another that we cannot

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.900
control but that generate

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.940
a threat or an opportunity.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.540
As we see, Pest is an acronym for

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.000
the four possible political,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.680
economic, social and technological factors.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.740
And it is necessary to do an analysis

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.560
from this perspective, from this

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.840
holistic perspective and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.640
not leave any of them because there

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.720
are more factors that affect a

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.360
company than they first seem.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.120
Today we will give you examples that

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.240
will help you to see it.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.720
By the way, sometimes PEST

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.620
is considered or used as the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.040
acronym PEST and legal factors

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560
and environmental factors

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.100
are incorporated.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.280
We will use PEST which is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.860
also the most common formula.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.900
Let us start.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.460
The illegal politicians.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.900
We have to analyze how the political

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.540
and illegal situation affects

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.660
the company.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040
It affects in many ways.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.660
They affect laws, affect

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.260
taxes, accept trade policies,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
for example protectionism,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.820
tariffs, the VAT you have

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.860
to pay in each of the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.220
countries, etc.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.100
The restrictions you put, the requirements

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.660
that ask you to sell in one

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.280
country or another, for example.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.780
A very clear example of the impact

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.920
it has, the huge impact it has

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.040
on the political and legal situation

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.400
in companies is the legal

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400
problems that companies like

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.980
Uber or like Blablacar or like

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.620
Airbnb are facing, for example.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.140
They are platforms that unite individuals

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.440
with a disruptive model

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.300
with respect to the traditional model.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.480
And that is making a lot of noise

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.140
and that has many collectives against.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.960
It is not yet known how the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.300
legislation will affect it, how

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.380
it will affect it in each of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.440
the markets in which it is.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.500
In many cases, it has to stop

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.700
operating.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.040
That is to say, to realize

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.840
the huge impact that the P of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.820
political factors has on business

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820
of this type.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.840
There are, for example, more

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.360
examples, there are that are

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.960
directly in sectors that are regulated.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.300
The influence of political

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.560
factors is huge.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.900
Competitors are

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.280
now protected.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840
There can be no more competitors,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.580
so the entry barriers are

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.080
very high and the profitability

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.000
too.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.380
Imagine that this changes.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.480
Imagine that regulation is flexible

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.320
and sectors, such as pharmacies

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.560
in Spain, are liberalized

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.800
and anyone can open

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.600
a pharmacy.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.820
This would increase competition

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.880
and therefore price war.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.860
The profitability in the sector

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.080
would decrease considerably.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.600
More examples of how political

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.460
factors affect.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.020
In some places there is pure

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.120
political insecurity.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.900
There have been cases of companies,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
for example, Repsol, a Spanish

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.220
company in Argentina, expropriated

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.280
the IPF subsidiary.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.700
These are political decisions

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.260
that have a huge impact, in this

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.120
case on Repsol’s result account.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.270
We go with economic factors.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.690
Economic factors or politicians

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.270
in many cases may seem

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.730
to overlap.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.590
Let us see some example.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.670
We are talking about exchange rates.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.670
You have a relationship with Russia.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.810
Your comparisons are Russian.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.670
Imagine it.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.970
The ruble, as it did

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.890
in 2016, is now falling.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.590
So your comparisons have lost a lot

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.030
of purchasing power and your product

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.510
is suddenly much more expensive

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.450
for them.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.770
Imagine the effect that has.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.290
There are or sectors that are heavily

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.430
influenced, for example,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.830
by interest rates.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.810
The real estate sector is very clear.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.130
The real estate sector is the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.070
mortgage sector.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.930
If interest times are lower,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.590
a lot more people can access

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.910
mortgages or can access

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.310
the purchase of a home.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.570
The price of housing

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.950
is falling.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.310
And vice versa, if interest

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.550
rates rise, mortgages are more expensive

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.250
for the general population.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.230
The real estate market

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.550
is slowing down.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.770
Let’s look at social factors.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.990
These are factors that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.290
are related to the lifestyle, to the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.050
tastes, to the patterns of consumption.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.790


00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.830
with what is happening in society.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.210
Changes are constantly occurring

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.730
in society that create

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.350
opportunities or risks for

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.030
companies.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.730
Imagine or think about the huge

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.010
billionaire opportunity that is being

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.090
created due, which is being

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.710
generated today, because the middle

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.470
class in China is growing

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.450
enormously.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.110
There was no middle class in

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.450
China until a few years ago.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.570
And now there are hundreds of millions

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.950
of people with an equal purchasing

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.970
power to the West, who demand

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.950
domestic or foreign products,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.010
etc.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.430
It is a huge opportunity.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.170
There is also a

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.790
change in consumption

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.590
habits.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.990
And this is just an example.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.290
Every day, more people are concerned

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.850
about healthy eating, healthy

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.110
living, healthy life,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.170
and sports.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.070
For some companies, this can

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.170
be a huge opportunity.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.050
Companies focused on organic

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.190
products, healthy

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.950
products, products

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.990
or services related to

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.990
sports, gym chains, etc.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.310
For others, it is a threat.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.530
Think of prepared and calorie-

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.670
based and unhealthy meals

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.030
companies that will have to adapt

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.130
to this type of habit changes,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.970
social changes.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.960
I want you to be aware that the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.080
factors affecting companies

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.520
can be very diverse.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.000
One example is the terrorist threat.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.320
There are countries that have suffered

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.660
more than others the threat of

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.840
terrorist attacks and their tourism,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.080
the demand for foreign tourists

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.860
has been seen very decreased.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.020
This has led to the turists

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.660
going to other countries.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.240
In any case, a well-made analysis

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.740
of a hotel company, for

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.000
example, who is thinking about

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.980
building a hotel in a tourist

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.080
area should take into account

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.880
this type of threats.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.200
Let us go to the technological factors.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.160
In recent years, technology has

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.340
changed the world.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.500
Above all, the most obvious is digital

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.620
technology, the eruption of the Internet.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.800
Many sectors have changed.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.900
For some it has been an opportunity,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.420
they have already managed to create

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.520
big companies around new technologies

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.640
and for others it has been a wave

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.200
that has dragged them, has overcome

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.340
them, has been a threat.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.100
There are thousands of examples and today

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.160
it is not a matter of going into details,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.360
but for example Airbnb.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.440
Airbnb has revolutionized the tourist

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.040
accommodation industry with

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.340
its platform and the Internet.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.100
However, there are other companies,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.040
for example, the hotel

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.220
chains, which this revolution

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.220
has negatively affected.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.700
For some it is an

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.760
opportunity, for others

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.200
it is a threat.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.080
The eruption of electric cars.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.500
Tesla was the first, the pioneer

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.720
to take advantage of it.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.360
It’s the one that has grown the most

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.200
in this and has built a

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.380
superpowerful brand that probably

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.420
within a few years competes with

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.540
large groups thanks to this new

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.420
technology.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.100
Another key technological factor

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.440
in recent years has been the

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.560
arrival of mobile technology.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.540
This is an example of a company

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.360
called Tulotero, which I participate

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.940
as a partner, which is revolutionizing

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.200
the lottery market.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.500
Traditionally, the lottery was

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.480
purchased at a point of sale.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.520
Now you can buy it on the

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.140
mobile.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.420
This is a huge threat to many

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.620
traditional players within

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.280
the sector.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.340
And one case of failure that

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.320
is always cited in business

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.260
schools is Kodak.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.240
Kodak was the leader in camera

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.700
and in revealed before the arrival

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.120
of digital photography.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.640
But he could not anticipate this move.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.580
He could not convert.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.100
And there were other players,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.960
their competitors who ravaged the

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.720
market and left him absolutely out.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.320
And despite having an

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.780
absolute dominance position,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.840
being the market leader, he

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.380
had the resources to upgrade

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.020
and take advantage of

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.780
that opportunity.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.580
I will give you a last example

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.700
because I was curious to see

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.320
how the factors affecting

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.940
a company are very, very varied.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.120
And in this case it is related

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.940
to the environment.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.320
Well, I have a friend who has

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.880
a family company with a very

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.960
high turnover that manufactures,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.780
among other things, fans.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.420
This summer in Spain,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.940
the temperatures

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.340
have been high.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.200
And this has led to the sales

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.980
of fans throughout the supermarket,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.580
large distribution, online,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.680
etc., even on Amazon, have

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.340
been shot.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.460
This has had a very, very positive

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.160
effect on the sales of this company

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.240
I am talking about.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.920
It is an example for you to

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.160
see that even factors like

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.540
climate change affect enormously.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.220


00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.280
Finally, I leave you this picture.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.920
I recommend that when you

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.240
have to do a PEST analysis do

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.060
it in a structured way.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.740
Use a table in which you identify

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.180
what are the political,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.400
economic, social and technological

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.540
factors that affect

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.460
the company you are studying.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.560
Also, classify these factors

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.900
according to their impact.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.240
Some will have a very high impact, others will

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.900
have a medium and others will have a low impact.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.200
Depending on the company, depending

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.880
on the sector and depending

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.940
on the countries in which you

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.540
are operating.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.220
For example, in the case of Uber or

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.620
Airbnb or revolutionary

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.680
models of this type that are within

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.440
a legal limit, because the political

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.880
factor has a key impact.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.980
So much so that, in some cases,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.200
you will make investments to enter

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.400
countries that you will later

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.580
even have to leave or have to

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.380
spend a lot of money on lawyers.
