00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.660
Let's talk about the segmentation

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.860
strategy, which I think, as you

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.380
told me, is one of the keys to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.960
your success.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.840
Then I would like you to

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.360
analyze, in addition to how yours

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.920
is, what you have focused on,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880
which one will be true, what you

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.100
have tried to avoid, or what is

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.580
what the magazine usually does

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.940
wrong.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.820
I like how you focus on it,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.660
because in fact, we did so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.200
for that.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.020
One of the things I learned a lot about

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.300
Bank Investment is this, is segmentation.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.900
How companies had broken or broken

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.040
absolutely the customer they

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.300
were aiming for not knowing

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.840
how to implement it properly.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.060
Then you find companies that have been

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.980
on the market for a long time, 40,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.360
50 years, and that suddenly the public

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.660
that they were aimed at, that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.120
they were 25 years old, now they are

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.160
65 years old.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.360
And when they realize that this audience

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.200
starts not buying, because they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.900
no longer consume this type of product.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.880
So you thought about selling

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.620
the company, right?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.620
More or less, no.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.820
These are creditors.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.560
We are no longer interested in buying

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.200
such companies.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
Yes, but you realize that they have

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.440
lost all their product, all their pure

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.740
state-of-the-art and they are companies

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.400
that disappear.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.400
So no matter how big you are and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.900
the years you've been in the industry,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.680
if you're not able to keep

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.520
a type of customer, you're

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.960
likely to end up disappearing.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.420
These companies that then want to return

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940
to their customer, as their brand

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.800
is already very related to an

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.560
age-old audience, recovering another

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.080
age is virtually impossible.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.940
It is positioning.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.180
You have to change the name, you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.640
have to change the logo, you have to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.600
change a lot of things.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.760
That is practically impossible.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.220
It has been done, but it is not easy.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.960
We have to address

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.160
a customer with

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.520
an age.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.920
And that client, within this whole

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.180
segmentation proposal, we are aware

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.060
that it will reach a point where

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.820
it will not want to consume

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.720
the epidemic, because it will change.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.260
And we are very proud of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.620
that.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.720
by age.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.280
By age, no longer physical, I'm going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.120
to tell you something that's not

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.720
very philosophical, but also mental.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.420
Because you can buy a woman of 55,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.140
60 years old who feels very young,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.980
and you can see her in her way of

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.940
dressing, or you can buy a girl

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940
of 20 years old who feels much older.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.900
We are between 25 and 45 years

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.880
old.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.960
And when those ages are more or less

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.140
passing, this is not pure science, that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.100
is, you have 46, you can no longer

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.080
buy me, it is more or less.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.900
And once those ages pass, jewelry

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.860
consumption is no longer typically this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.400
type of jewelry, it is different.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.160
Per it is a high-end jewelry, it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.980
is a jewelry, maybe it is a brochure,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.600
something we don't want to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.040
offer within this store,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.820
because then we would change

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.720
the segmentation

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.200
of this customer.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.160
We have brought the customer

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.020
to know other brands and to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.620
consume them.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.880
We are very proud of the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.380
time you have spent with

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.640
us, and then we open the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.820
doors to other brands.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.320
That's very important, not

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.880
wanting to have them with

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.280
you all the time.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.520
We have taken advantage of your purchasing

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.480
power, we have maximized your

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.580
economic power within our company,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.320
within your consumption, and from

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320
there we open your doors

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.020
and say, now you can fly and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.440
go with the next one.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.740
What I want to understand is, why

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.720
do you do that?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.020
What are the benefits of doing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.540
that from segmenting strategy

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.380
in a niche, it's not so niche

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.900
because it's a very wide audience,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.560
but you're thinking about a profile

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.740
and why don't you want others?

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.660
I think every segment is very

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.040
positive economically speaking.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.580
We liked it, first because it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.760
was ours and we understood

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.460
it much better than others.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.940
To begin with, you understand them better.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.500
and exact.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920
If it's your age, your tastes,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.320
you understand that audience well.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.620
When you start shooting them all,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.080
you understand them worse.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.400
Well, not only do you understand them

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.580
worse, but there are also audiences

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.940
who don't want to meet in the same store.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.580
One of the 18 doesn't want to buy one of 60.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.860
If you have a 1000 square

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.260
meter store, if you can

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.600
segment within the store and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.120
you have a lady area, you

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.360
have a teenage area, you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.180
have a...

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.100
Yes or not, but you can also do the same.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.540
But you can or put it on two different

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.880
floors, then they no longer share

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.300
spaces and if they feel comfortable.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.700


00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.280
We had a client and why were

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.680
we there?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.780
One, because we understand it because

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.220
of our age, because we consume

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.440
that type of product and two, because

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.480
we believe that it is a customer

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.820
who begins his work stage,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.560
who begins to have for his own

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.960
purchase and who begins to make

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.940
his decisions.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.260
We also want to make it easier

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.740
for us to sell them a certain

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.060
product.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.180
In retail, it is the best customer,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.060
between the ages of 25 and 45.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.240
We do not want to leave there.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.900
We have to be very clear that you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.040
should always create a product that

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.060
you like to 25 and 45.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.340
If you have a consumer of one age,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.960
it is very likely that consumer

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.560
does not want to be identified

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.500
with other ages, because you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.080
feel 10, 30 years old and already

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.260
are.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.860
The 18 year old doesn't want to

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.140
buy 60 and vice versa.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.740
So, in our stores that have about

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.520
70 square meters, an average

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.520
of 60, 50 meters, I can't create

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.900
segments inside the store where

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.900
the consumer isn't looking

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.600
and knowing that they're sharing

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.780
the same product.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.580
Today you need to feel absolutely

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.240
identified with what you consume,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.900
I go with this jacket, but

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.460
maybe a person of another

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.320
age or younger would not go

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.100
with this jacket or with

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.100
twins or whatever.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.520
If you start opening the doors to everyone,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.820
what will happen is that suddenly

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.160
people no longer want to go, because

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.460
in the 18s says, I didn't want

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.320
to go to this store because I

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.460
bought in the 60s, in the 60s they

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.480
say I didn't want to go because

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.080
I bought in the 18s, and then

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.900
suddenly you have the store

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.640
empty.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.860
So what benefit does it have?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.200
People can feel identified.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.860
That's very important when you're

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.700
creating a brand, a product,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.600
a segmentation.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.680
And when creating a brand also

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.940
in the long term, that is what

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.680
I really want, I don't want

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.620
to get any ballot, I want it to

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.360
be a brand that can grow 50, 60,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.340
70 years, it's when you have very

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.780
clear your segmentation, the

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.000
not get out of it, what you'

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.660
ll generate is, because for

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.100
example you have, I'll put a very

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.260
obvious example, an Inditex

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.600
where there is Versca that goes

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.220
for teenagers, then there is

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.080
Uterque that goes for people

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.360
of a higher purchasing power,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.440
of a certain age, and then

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.080
you have a Zara that maybe can

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.200
understand all audiences, but

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.240
within the store also segments

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.020
around the design of one product

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.900
or another.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.720
If you are not able, that is, if you

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.480
have this segmentation

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.580
very clear, you can make your

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.600
company evolve 60 years and not

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.440
get out of there.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.200
Then you're constantly gaining new

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.620
customers because they're the ones

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.820
that suddenly get into your segmentation

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.400
and you're leaving

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.000
them out.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.680
Then you have a brand that

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.500
can be identified in an age

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.000
range in a customer

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.620
type for many years.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.240
It is a long-term brand.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.600
I've seen companies that unwillingly

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.940
started targeting a type of customer,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.540
suddenly their team of designers

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.020
has aged, their sales

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.540
team has aged and are creating

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.220
a product for another type

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.000
of customer and when they've

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.100
wanted to realize, that customer

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.580
is no longer consuming and

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.800
the company disappears.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.900
Then it is very important.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
That is to say for me they are two

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.200
clear benefits, one long-term and then

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.400
the not going at all because you

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.440
can lose all your customers too.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.840
The recommendation for all Power

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.100
MVs, which many are also in this

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.920
challenge of creating a

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.720
value proposal, in this case is sermony.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.020
Don't get lost in, and in some

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.600
cases, the more niche the better.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.200
You're going to a large audience, right?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.260
The power of AD is very broad.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.400
and yes.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.520
The profile is also wide, it's

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.260
a fortune.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.800
and yes.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.640
But usually the recommendation

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.520
we give, especially to people who

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.420
are creating new proposals, is that

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.080
you look for a niche because in

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.840
a niche it is much easier first

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.040
that you understand it well,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.260
position yourself in that niche

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.960
and so on.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.380
Don't try to shoot everything.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.200
It is as important to know how to say

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.120
yes as it is to know how to say no.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.720
It is more important to say

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.320
no.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.340
A thousand thanks.
