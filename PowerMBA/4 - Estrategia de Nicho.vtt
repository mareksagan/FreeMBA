00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.940
Today we will go deeper into one

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.660
of Michael Porter's generic

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.860
strategies, in this case the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.420
segmentation strategy.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.640
Well, first, there may be people

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.700
who call it segmentation strategy,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.000
focus strategy, niche strategy,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.780
in English for example

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.460
they call it focus strategy.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.800
Well, the main criterion, which

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.660
you should already know, of the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.420
segmentation strategy is that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.060
we focus on a specific customer

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.980
segment.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.560
Remember that competitors who

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.800
choose cost leadership by

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.780
differentiation are

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.960
usually larger companies,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020
which do it to target

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.520
all or almost all segments

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.840
of a market.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.940
Eye, they don't have to go to all

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.060
segments with the same proposal,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.680
they are companies that may

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.260
have segmented, but in the end

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.520
what they do is go to everyone,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.020
right?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960
What we are doing today

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.560
is focusing on one of

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.000
the areas.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.460
The word focus I think is the most

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.820
important word that helps us

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.280
understand this type of strategy.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.780
And look, here we have to keep in

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.520
mind that when we talk about focus

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.680
we can really define it from different

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.740
perspectives.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.040
I think from three.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.340
You can focus on one of the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.960
demographic segments

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.180
and I'll give you an example.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.980
Mercedes is a clear competitor of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.320
differentiation that offers a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.960
lot of value but that is aimed

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.100
at all customer segments because

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.120
it has cars for families, for

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.240
young people, etc. of all kinds, sports.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.140
The Ferrari that we have seen

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380
is a niche competitor.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.840
Why is it?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.560
Because it focuses on a very specific

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.820
demographic profile in a segment

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.860
in addition to the very small

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.740
population that are

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.900
mainly men, be it more with

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.480
very high incomes.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.140
But the focus can also be geographical.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.420
A competitor, for example, of a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.800
hamburger, a chain of hamburgers

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.420
that competes in low cost at the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.720
national level would be a low

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.160
cost competitor, leading in cost.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.720
However, you may have

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.920
local competitors who are

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.800
segmentation or niche strategies

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.760
because they have decided

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.800
to focus on a specific

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.580
geography.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.120
Either the focus or specialization

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.080
can also come by the product

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.720
and you will understand it very well.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.120
Decathlon is the largest retail

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.620
manufacturer in the sports sector

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.860
and has an extensive range

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.340
of products for all sports.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.000
Well, there are niche competitors

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.440
that compete with Decathlon on

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.180
specific products.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.660
A bicycle store has

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.080
specialized in bicycles,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.540
cycling, cyclists.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.760
Or a basketball store, the same.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.040
Well, we've already defined the first

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.940
criterion that is that you have to focus

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.660
on something.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.920
We have seen that it can be based

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.440
on focusing on a very specific

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.140
segment of customers or a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.460
geographical area or a specific

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.460
product etc.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.980
But in addition to the segmentation

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.580
strategy, there are several types

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.660
of segmentation strategy because

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.800
as we have seen in addition

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.780
to focusing on a customer segment

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.980
you have to choose to look for

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.040
a competitive advantage that is either

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.880
to look for the cost lead in

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.120
that segment or try to be the cheapest

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.420
or the one that has the lowest

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.180
costs or look for differentiation.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.000
I want you to know that I think it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.340
makes more sense in a segmentation

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.140
strategy, it makes more sense to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.140
look for differentiation

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.420
and I put it to you with the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.240
example of the bike store.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.940
The bike store't make sense

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.340
to compete in cost with

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.860
Decathlon.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.180
Nothing else is almost impossible.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.800
What it has makes more sense is that by

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.540
being more specialized it offers a greater

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.000
value, a greater service and covers

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.740
more for that.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.780
Let's take examples of

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.500
both types.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.240
We will see examples of

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.680
segmentation looking for cost leadership

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.140
as it could be to imagine

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.800
a local management with very

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.260
low prices, offers, etc.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.460
It would be to look for

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.240
cost-specialized segmentation

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.600
or value-specialized as it can

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.180
be a competitor of this management

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.980
that is a desk, a higher-level

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.380
tax advisory with higher

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.400
prices, etc.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.680
Or we go to cost specialization.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.100
Imagine a watch manufacturer

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.940
focused on a single product,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.660
also focused on very young people,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.060
a clear niche strategy but with

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.720
very low prices of about

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480
50 euros, that is, more low

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.920
manufacturing costs, etc.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.520
It is specialized in cost.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.060
But luxury watch manufacturers

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.840
will also opt for a segmentation

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.920
strategy.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.260
They are focusing on a very specific niche.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.500
What happens is that in this case they

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.420
do not seek cost specialization,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.660
what they are looking for is differentiation,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.520
it is very clear, isn't it?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520
Another example, a local restaurant,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.440
a segmentation strategy that is very

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.920
focused, because that, in its area

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.700
of influence.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.140
But in this case what you are looking for is the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.560
menu of the day, what you are looking for is that

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.160
you are chosen for the price.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.400
However, there are other

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.260
local restaurants that also compete

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.340
in segmentation or niche,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.940
but that in this case does it

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.760
seeking differentiation, offering

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.080
a higher value, very high prices,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.240
high quality, etc.
