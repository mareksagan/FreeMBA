00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.460
Let us talk now specifically about

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.420
television, which is the medium

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.540
in which you are, that you know.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.420
We will look at when you

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.080
think it is appropriate

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.820
to choose TV.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.220
In a startup.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.860
At what stage of development is it appropriate?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.980
For us, we are fundamentally

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.360
focused on digital,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.560
i.e. mobile or

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.080
web.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.500
Our theory about this, when it'

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.420
s time for an online business

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.140
to get on television, or even

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.420
this can apply to other media,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.160
we think there's a first

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.720
phase, an early phase where

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.980
you have to build with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.280
online marketing.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.720
Why is it?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.220
Because it is cheaper, it is

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.680
more invented, it is easier to start

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.140
acquiring a user base, it is easier

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.880
to interact with them, it is easier

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.820
to access your early adopter,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700
because after all it is easier

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.180
to capture in user online, in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.680
the online environment and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.440
interact with him.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.560
It is more modular, right?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000
It is more modular, you can experiment.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.240
We think that an online business

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.440
has to be interacting

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.880
and listening, it has to build

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.320
a minimally relevant user

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.040
base, it has to interact

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.240
with this user base to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.560
go improving things continuously.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.120
A startup is improving, improving,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.500
improving, and pivoting everything

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.460
it has to pivot until

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.400
it finds its site.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.080
We at The Power Envie have drawn

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.520
the phases of product development,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.560
first you have to validate a problem

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.180
and the solution, then you have

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.500
to reach product market fit, then

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.820
it is convenient to invest something

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.960
looking for efficiency,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.180
still not the reach to validate

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.160
your growth channels,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.900
etc.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.240
This is something that our students

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.260
have already acquired knowledge.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.180
Because in this case the product

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.000
has to be tested, it has to prove,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.760
that is, following all these

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.480
phases there is a time when

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.780
you have to go demonstrating a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.900
series of milestones.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.720
And there is a first milestone that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.540
is what is my online capture, what

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420
is my cost of acquisition,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.420
how converted, what is my lifetime

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.860
value potential, that is, you

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.420
are building gradually and for

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.840
that as you listen to your user

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.020
you are improving your product.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.920
So what do we look at when

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.240
we think it's time to get into

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.760
offline media or get into

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.640
television?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.820
At the time you have a ratio,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.260
depending obviously

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.380
on the type of business,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.820
engagement or repetition,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.020
repetition is essential,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.840
or conversion strong

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.860
enough.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.160
Why is it?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.200
Why does this indicate you?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.780
This indicates that the product likes.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860
If there is conversion, then the product

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.580
attracts and if there is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.260
recurrence, it really likes.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.440
So, at the time you have a sufficiently

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.840
representative user base,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.020
you don't have a 20; at the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.920
time you have a sufficiently

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.760
representative user base,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.100
that has good conversion

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.480
rates, good recurrence

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.840
rates, what is indicating

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.580
is that the product

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.680
is about to stay and that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.900
it just needs to get to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.240
the masses.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.580
What do we mean by this?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.520
That if a product still doesn'

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.500
t have the conversion ratios

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.320
it needs for the product to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.420
work or the recurrence is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.640
attractive enough, you'll

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.680
have to spin.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.740
You will have to make fundamental

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.760
changes to the product that will

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.800
change your image.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
So the worst thing you can do in the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.220
offline world, especially on television,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.600
if you invest a lot of money, is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.700
to launch a product that doesn'

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.500
t work, which disappoints the user.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.860
Because then it will be much more difficult

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.960
for you to turn it all around.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.020
We have done this very in

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.940
detail and have called it scaling

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.060
prematurely.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.080
In addition, we have identified in the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.140
development phases of a startup there

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.480
are basically two moments.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.440
There are two phases, before product

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.620
market fit and after product

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.240
market fit.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.220
And before you get to the product

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.520
market fit, before you're sure of

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.740
everything you're saying, what you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.860
like, that there's repetition, that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.980
there's engagement, that we

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.480
have a relative conversion

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.400
ratio, good enough, etc.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.340
That is, before you validate

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.200
everything, what you can't do

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.540
is invest heavily in marketing

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.020
to scale.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.060
Why does that have to come later?

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.300
I think it fits perfectly with

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.000
what you are saying.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.760
It is dangerous.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.000
There are people who are in a hurry.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220
We are the truth is that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.380
we get all kinds of projects,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.540
fases earlier, fases larger.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.400
People often come very stressed with him,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.500
it is that they will steal me the idea,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.780
it is that we have to get there.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.860
So the rush is bad when

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.920
the product is not tested

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.380
enough, when scalability

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.580
is not tested, when conversion

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.160
is not tested.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.700
Because at the end you are getting badly used

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.100
and at the end you will make waters on

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.820
the other side.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.400
Has there been any case of that,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.280
of scaling prematurely that products

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.200
that have not yet reached

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.260
this sufficient validation

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.720
have used means like yours

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.720
and have been a failure?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.140
We have disadvised, we being

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.760
in that sector that we think

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.640
we have a certain responsibility

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.080
to not sell.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.800
Everyone who comes to us gives

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.840
us our point of view.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.460
We think it's soon, we talk in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.880
six months, we talk already.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.540
Some people are in a hurry.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.800
Some of them have decided against

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.420
our advice, have decided

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.220
to do so on the other hand

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.920
and have struck, several, a few.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.720
Why is it?

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.240
Because television, radio, and

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.320
the media in general do not do miracles.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.740
They can be very relevant, they can

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.360
help a lot, but they do no miracles.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.820
So experience to me tells me,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.400
when is a television campaign

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.900
a success or a television

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.780
campaign a failure?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.980
Interestingly, success is usually

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.020
in those products that are good and,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.340
curiously, in those products

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.840
that are not good, the television

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.060
campaign is a failure.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.480
No matter how you do it,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.320
creativity is important.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.820
How does this type of thing matter?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.520
That says Sonelis, who coined the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.980
term prohacker, is a strategist

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.220
that I love and what he says

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.980
is that he has usually managed

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.480
to scale many companies

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.980
and make the public ones,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.620
etc.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.900
And what he says is that his conclusion

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.040
after analyzing hundreds of cases

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.520
and many very successful is

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.240
exactly that.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.840
It's not that it's been a matter that

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.900
marketers have been more skilled at

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.140
using the channels better, no.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.000
It was a matter of the product

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.800
was better.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.660
Because it sounds very simple, but it is.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.940
It was a matter of having done the

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.420
duties in the previous phase, they

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.860
had tested well live everything

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.140
until they had come up with something

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.960
that really loved people and then

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.400
scaling it has been so easy because

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.320
the market is that directly...

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.700
We see a lot of people who come

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.040
to see us, mostly early stages,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.580
and they tell us their story

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.640
and they tell us that people

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.200
love it.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.520
Look at the metric and say...

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.500
The metric doesn't tell me that.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.780
Yes, yes, it's that we've tested it, we'

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.900
ve talked about it with I don't know what

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.520
and people love it.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.320
Well, then when you really have

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.480
a metric that shows me that

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.900
people love it, we talk.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.640
We'll leave it in six

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.940
months and talk again.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.120
And what we find in the vast

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.320
majority of cases is that then

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.500
they return to us with a completely

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.540
different product.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.880
Why is it?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.800
Because at the moment you

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.660
interact with your user base,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.940
you know whether people like

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.600
it or not.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.220
It's not to say that he loves

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.840
the paper.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.080
That is, really from what is an

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.360
initial presentation of a

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.720
startup to how it ends up being

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.780
looks like a castan.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.000
So, it has to evolve.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.260
So, many of the cases we see

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.480
are also international copycats.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.720
A copycat must be adapted

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.680
to the Spanish public.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.700
So, it doesn't work for you what

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.360
has worked in the United States

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.600
necessarily in Spain and maybe

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.140
it's a matter of shading three or

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.780
four things and once you get the

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.940
key, here it is, to the infinite

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.560
and beyond.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.180
But until you have given the key,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.560
don't be suicidal because what

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.200
you're going to do is sink.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.260
Well, I think we already understand

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.940
well what the middle food equity consists

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.860
of, what is the mechanism.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.340
We understand well, you have perfectly

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.920
explained to us at what point, which

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.500
is also very similar to the phases

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.560
of product development, at what

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.680
point it makes sense to opt

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.800
for this type of growth lever.
