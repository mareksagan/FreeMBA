00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.420
Facebook’s platform consists

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.820
of three major blocks,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.060
which are campaigns,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.260
ad sets and ads.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.880
You will see it more graphically.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.240
Each campaign is a grouping of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.540
ad sets and you can have

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.680
as many as you want.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.900
Each set of ads is a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.460
set of ads.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.400
That is, each campaign can have

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.460
endless sets of ads and each

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.560
set of ads can have endless

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.480
sets of ads.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.120
Within the campaign section, you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.560
define the goal to which I want

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.900
to direct the campaign.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.940
It can be a brand recognition

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.020
goal, a goal of attracting

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.800
traffic to my website, playing

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.080
a video or even conversions

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.620
on my website.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.100


00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.340
That is, that they leave the data or

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.540
that they buy a product.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.440
I will give you an example.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.900
Imagine that we want to create a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.960
Christmas campaign and we want

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.500
to create two different segments

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.120
for this Christmas campaign.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.540
The first is for men over 35 years

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.960
of age and who live only

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.700
in Madrid.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.820
But I also want those men

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.600
to have college studies

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.880
completed and also have an

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.100
interest in sports and Netflix.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.680
I have already set up my target

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.340
audience.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.100
Now I’ll tell Facebook where

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.800
I want my ads to appear.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.380
I can tell you that they only appear

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.000
on smartphones and tablets or only

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.860
for example on computers.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.440
But it’s that Facebook also gives

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.200
us the possibility to choose where

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.020
they appear within Facebook,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.280
Instagram and elsewhere.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.580
For example, I want them to only

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.620
appear in the news section that

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.940
is the Facebook wall.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.740
There are other options

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.180
such as typical ads on the right

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.360
column or I just want it

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.840
to appear on Instagram and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.880
not on Instagram Stories.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.300
Audios Network is the display

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.580
of Facebook.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.940
To give you an example and that

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.760
you understand, if you’ve

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.740
ever had advertising

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880
in an app or a game, because

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.220
those ads can perfectly be

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.020
Facebook ads.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.520
And lastly, Messenger, which here

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720
in Spain is not used much, but for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.000
example in Latin America and the United

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.960
States the use of Messenger is

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.280
almost equal or greater than

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.380
that of WhatsApp.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.360
Finally, I’ll determine once

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.840
I have the targeting and the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.860
locations where I want my

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.600
ads to appear, I’ll tell

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.220
Facebook that I want to spend

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.700
only 50 euros a day on this

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.040
set of ads that I’m setting

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400
for men and I can tell you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.100
it starts and ends

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.360
on a certain date.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.860
And the last thing I’ll tell you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.760
is how much I’m willing to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.740
pay for this ad.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.500
So what is my pocket.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.620
I have set a 25 cents price

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.500
per click.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.780
If my auction is above other

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.180
companies that are auctioning

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.000
for this same target audience,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.400
my ads will appear.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.340
If you are below, they won’t appear.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.560
Once I have defined segmentation,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.340
defined location, budget

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.200
and auction, Facebook tells me I

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.760
have a potential reach of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360
between 240 and 680 people and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.680
of which it tells me that between

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.320
5 and 32 clicks I’ll follow

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.760
a day.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.190
We have already created the segmentation

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.770
or segmentations for our campaign.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.530
Now we need to create the ad or

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.350
ads for each segmentation.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.310
Facebook offers different formats

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.790
of advertising.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.790
This would be a sequential

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.950
ad or also called a carousel,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.590
where we use it to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.170
show people who are

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.230
behind the computer.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.560
But then there are also formats of a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.120
single image, a single video, presentation

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.500
or collection.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.490
The parts of the ad are common

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.170
on all types of platforms.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.970
We would have the text or copy,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.470
the creativity or video, the ad

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.550
title and a small description.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.170
I want to show you this advertisement

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:42.190
we use on Facebook.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.220
I will use this ad to give

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.580
you an example and give you

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.460
some advice to create a good ad.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.240
The first thing to do is copy

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.120
or text the ad.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.320
The copy must be striking and attractive

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.600
to the person who sees it.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.000
I would say it should be a copy that

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.520
goes straight to the benefits of

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.880
your product or service.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.380
Also, as you can see, we have

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.920
added a cta or link to the page

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.300
where we want to redirect the person,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.400
because there are a lot of people

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.660
who would click on the link instead

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.720
of the ad, because it is

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.460
a link.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.720
We also used emoji, which are

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.860
great for attracting attention,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.180
but you should not abuse

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.660
them.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.120
Another tip is to use video

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.740
instead of creativity.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.640
This is due to the trend that there

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.720
is more and more of using video.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.520
In addition, if you look at it,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.260
the video has a square format that

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.460
is made up to take up more space

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.620
inside the screen, both on

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840
computers and on the smartphone.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.440
One tip is to subtitle the videos,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.740
because there are a lot of people

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.800
who are using the phone on

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.220
public sites without sound and

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.880
so they could see what the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.600
person says.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.380
If you use creativity instead

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.260
of a video, it is important that

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.940
the text within creativity

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.380
does not occupy more than 20%

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.680
of what creativity is.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.800
This is a rule, not a advice,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.060
it is a Facebook rule that will make

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.200
if it occupies more than 20% of

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.880
your ads have worse performance.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.060
Finally, the ad button or cta we advise

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.460
not to use the registration button

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.000
or buy anymore because people

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.540
are very reluctant to give

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.620
directly to register or to

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.700
buy a product directly from

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.300
Facebook.
