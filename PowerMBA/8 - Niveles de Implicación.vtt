00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.080
Today we will talk about a very interesting

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.080
concept that is involvement.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.600
The implication is the translation

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720
of the term involvement in English.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.380
Basically, the purchase of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.980
a product or service always has

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.200
a certain level of involvement

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280
in the customer.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.440
What does this mean for the level of engagement?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.280
Well, it is the level

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.340
of effort, economic effort,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.860
expectations, perceived

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.040
risk, time spent making decisions,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.700
of importance

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.180
for the customer.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.720
Therefore, all purchases have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.440
a certain level of involvement,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.780
high, medium or low, or as we

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.000
want to classify it.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.480
The point is that it is very interesting,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.060
it is very important that you understand

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.880
this.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.280
Why is?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.180
Because the purchases or products

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.900
that are related to low-level involvement

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.960
have nothing to do with how the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.300
customer makes the decision,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.080
what is what the customer expects,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
what expectations are

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.240
being generated, what leverage

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.160
we have to use to convince

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.560
the customer, what channels

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.040
we have to use, etc.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.100
That is, the first thing you have

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.400
to do is understand if we are talking

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880
about high, medium or low-impact

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.220
products to be able to adapt

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.700
absolutely all that you have after.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.760
You will understand it very well.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.100
We will make a classification in three

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.020
ranges.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.520
This is really a scale, that is,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.720
this is not white or black, it is

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.560
not that a product is in one quadrante

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160
or another, but I want you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.200
to understand at least the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.360
extremes.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.520
And let’s start, for example,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.300
with products or purchases that

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.600
have a low implication.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.060
Well, because they are more regular,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.820
more recurrent purchases, with

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.740
a lower price.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.080
I have put here that they are more

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.660
comfortably because usually the customer

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.760
does not perceive much difference

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.080
between one and the other.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.440
It gives you a little like, they

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.680
are low-risk, low-impact,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.480
low-importance purchases.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.720
You could give thousands of examples,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.480
but for example milk, because

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.740
some socks, buying toothpaste,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.760
a medicine, the coffee shop, choosing

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.860
a coffee shop or another, I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.000
think it’s easy to understand

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.920
what I’m referring to.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.180
What is important here is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.280
really to understand what

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.540
implications this has or what

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.940
repercussions this has on how the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.500
customer makes the decision,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.520
because from this knowledge

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.620
it is when we will be able

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.700
to adapt everything in our

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.560
marketing strategy.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.180
Well, basically I want you to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.500
know that customers in this type

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.780
of decisions make them almost in

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960
many cases by routine.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.900
That is, you buy the brand of milk

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.280
but basically the one you’ve

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.160
always bought.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.420
I say it below, you can have brand

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.740
loyalty but in many cases it is a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.480
loyality almost without foundation,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.720
it is a loyalty by inertia and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.700
when you buy you don’t compare

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.140
much between the different options.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.740
Basically, it is very important that you

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.020
have products that are accessible,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.240
those that come to you best and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.060
in many cases are impulsive purchases.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.980
This is how the customer’s decisions

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.860
are made.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.160
I will give you some examples of

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.240
middle level involvement.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.680
If we are talking about choosing

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.820
a restaurant where you will dine

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.340
or a furniture or your dentist

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.820
or make a suit on your own,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.520
here in this case we are talking

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.040
about shopping in which the implication

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.700
is a little bigger.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.940
Let us go to the extreme.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.400
We go to shopping where the involvement

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.500
is very high.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.840
Why is?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.400
Because they are unusual purchases

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.380
with very high prices where

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.100
expectations are very high, etc.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.740
Here in this case, customers perceive

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.340
a lot of difference between

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.740
each of the alternatives.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.400
Think long, etc.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.400
What is important here?

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.240
Just like when we analyzed low involvement,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.720
the important thing is that we understand

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.420
how the customer makes the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.300
decision.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.440
In this case, customers do what

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.540
they do is analyze, compare

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.360
many, compare everything that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360
is on the market, prices,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.800
features, devote time, the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.480
process is much longer.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.660
This is not an impulse purchase as

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.320
before and you also have to keep

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.120
in mind that your expectations

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.000
are very high because of dedication,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040
effort in resources,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.340
in time, etc.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.200
is much larger.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.040
And this means that after you

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.240
buy you the evaluation they will

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.940
make of your product or service

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.040
will be very high.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.240
And not meeting their expectations.
