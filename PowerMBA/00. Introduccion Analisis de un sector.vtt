00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.430
To be an expert in strategy and to

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.510
understand the business in general,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.730
you must be able to perform a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.530
good external analysis of the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.250
environment in which a company is.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.570
In general, to make a strategic

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.870
diagnosis you have to know yourself

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.110
well, you have to know what your

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.950
strengths are, what your

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.850
weaknesses are, and you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.870
also have to know how to look

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.690
outside and analyze what is

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.230
out there and how it will affect

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.650
what is out there.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.290
This is what we call external analysis.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.750
As I said, it is a key competence

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.470
you will acquire in this course.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.610
Why is it?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.990
Because companies are not alone,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.990
they are not living isolated.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.290
All companies compete within a sector

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290
in which there is a competitive

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.570
dynamic, there are forces and

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.750
are also affected by another

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.430
series of factors, factors

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.970
of all kinds over which they

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.870
have no control, political,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.870
economic factors, etc.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.270
And in this course what we will

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.310
do is learn certain tools

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.630
and certain concepts that will

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.850
help you to analyze the environment

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.990
more deeply to perform

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.430
an external analysis.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.190
We will do it in six classes.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.590
In each of the classes we will

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.630
analyze the environment from a different

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.270
perspective.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.150
The first five classes are devoted

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.830
to analyzing the sector in which

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.550
the industry competes and the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.210
last class we call the macroenvironment

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.350
analysis.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.910
Now let's see what it is.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.270
How will we analyze the sector?

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.750
Well, the first thing I want you to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.370
be able to analyze the attractiveness

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.530
that a sector has.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.270
If it is big, it will grow.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.810
And here we will use, to analyze

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.910
the profitability of the sector,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.670
we will use a well-known tool,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.250
which you must know and understand

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.690
very well, which is the five forces

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.010
of Michael Porter, which

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.530
will allow us to very much simply

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.390
and intuitively identify or

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.070
anticipate what will be the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.430
sustained profitability

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.530
that we can get in an industry,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.810
in a sector.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.070
We will deepen into a concept that

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.430
you probably know, such as entry

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.890
barriers, the degree of protection

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.990
that there is around the companies

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.170
that compete within a sector,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.650
makes increasing profitability.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.650
This is a concept you need to understand

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.070
well.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.390
And what we will do is identify

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.510
what are the factors that

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.990
generate that there is an

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.790
entry barrier.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.550
We will study the life cycle.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.290
The product's life cycle.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.830
All products and sectors go

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.690
through a series of phases

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.510
or cycles and in each of them

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.770
particular circumstances are given.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.270
It competes differently, the advantages

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.410
turn out to be different competitive

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.530
advantages, the growth strategies

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.930
are different, etc.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.750
It is a very well-known model

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.830
that you have probably heard of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.250
and we will go deeper into that.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.310
We need to understand the structure

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.150
of a business.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.430
And what we will do is work with

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.050
concepts like whether the sector

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.870
is concentrated or fragmented

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.590
or automated.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.870
Why is it?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.730
Because sectors depending on the degree

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.970
of concentration that there is within

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.450
the sector change a lot of things.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370
It changes profitability, changes competitive

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.830
struggle, etc.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.870
Another key factor in the structure of

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.030
the sectors is the fact that they are

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.810
more or less differentiated.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.650
Of all the proposals if they are

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.990
very differentiated, the value

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.150
proposals of the different

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.250
competitors, as their own name

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.850
indicates, are very different

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.570
from each other.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.070
And at the other end, at the lower

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.950
degree of differentiation, we

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.210
would have the very commoditized

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.110
markets, in which the customer

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.110
perceives that everyone is equal.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.490
As with the rest of the analysis

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.310
perspectives, the fact that a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.910
sector is more differentiated

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.650
or more commoditized has

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.710
a huge implication on many

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.530
things.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.930
The competitive dynamics of a sector

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.570
depending on whether it is differentiated

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.810
or commoditized are very

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.670
different.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.890
The profitability that is

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.030
obtained, the customer relationships,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.670
the competitive struggle, etc.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.610
That's all I want you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.470
to understand.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.790
Finally, we will look at the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.190
macroeconomic situation.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.370
The macro-environment is called

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.190
external factors.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.290
It has nothing to do with the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.990
sector, but external factors,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.670
political, economic, social and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.570
technological, affecting in greater

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.110
or lesser degree all companies.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.230
To do this, we use a tool

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.410
called PEST, which is the acronym

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.710
for the factors I have said, and

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.690
that allows you to take a look

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.970
at what the factors are, how

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.730
they affect you and to what extent.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.190
This is done to anticipate

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.670
threats or identify opportunities.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.150
As I said, this is a competition

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.290
you have to acquire.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.570
You must be able to do an external

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.590
analysis.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.110
We will incorporate concepts.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.370
It is a fairly simple course.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.790
I think it is a fun course.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.330
And it is also a necessary and basic

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.230
course for everyone who wants to

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.470
be an expert in business and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.270
business strategy.
