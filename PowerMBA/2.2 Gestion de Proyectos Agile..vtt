00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.180
I think the best way seems to you.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.020
For example, let’s think of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.480
you want to develop a website.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.300
And let’s assume that this website

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.360
you want to do it for two different

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.160
problems.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.380
I want to make a website and I’m

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.880
going to hire an agency that makes

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.280
it for me.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.440
We will do it externally.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.320
There are two agencies.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.300
One works in a traditional way and another

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.560
works in a digital way.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.700
Let’s see what the advantages would

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.140
be because all this we’ve seen

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.420
sounds good, but you have to see

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.520
it grounded because it’s much

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.400
better.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.960
On her bridge, the traditional says,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020
Borja, we’ll be together for

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.560
three weeks.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.640
You will tell me you want on the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.890
website what you want and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.530
you don’t know.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.650
We will find out together over

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.450
the next six months.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.870
They will tell you, I’ll ask you that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.990
as you don’t know what we want, tell

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.570
me at least a week with focus that it’

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.210
s what you want and let’s go reviewing it.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.130
They will tell you that they will show

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.590
you in short cycles what you have

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.410
already done and they will be very close

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.910
to you.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.870
They will require you much more

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.090
responsibility than a traditional one.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.630
Finished the project you will get to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.510
the traditional and you will say,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.590
Borja, this is the result.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.230
They will sit down and show you a demo.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.050
This is the scene A.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.070
We sit down, someone comes to the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.610
office, we tell him the story, they

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.270
go.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.410
You’ll call him two or three times a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.350
month, and he’s going to be.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.830
Yes but well.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.010
It costs time and money, I will tell you.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.910
Cost and time and so on.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.910
And after two or three months, suddenly everything

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.850
is deliverable.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.890
The entire website.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.790
I don’t like this, nor this,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.190
nor this.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.210
I don’t like the look

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.570
and feel.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.750
It turns out that the payment gateway

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.930
can’t put on American Express

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.490
or I know what, for example.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.370
I don’t like it and I don’t like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.910
it having so many scratches.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.310
I want to be one page.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.090
And you think all those mistakes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.590
are already made.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.110
of course.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.150
It will be a boost to both you

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.850
and the provider.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.370
They start discussions that it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.950
was your fault, that was the reach, etc.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.270
The common thing in these cases is that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.590
it ends badly, because someone has to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.010
assume those mistakes that you have

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.230
to make.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.370
I do this, look, we are talking

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.010
about it and just putting me in

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.130
the situation, they put me nervous.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.430
Because I have lived it many times.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.690
That is, when the disallocation, I’m

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.110
not talking about working

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.590
with external suppliers, in general,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510
the disallocation between the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.410
goals of a person and those who execute

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.070
them and such always exists.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.990
And as always, the longer you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.050
wait, the more the possibility

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.510
opens up.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.270
The angle is larger.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.910
It is already amazing whatever.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.070
You’ve been working around here, but

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.110
you wanted something else, didn’

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.430
t you?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.910
With Aladdin, we solve this.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.410
Yes, such as, because like Allain, case

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.570
B, we talk about case B, the other

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.450
provider that would do it with Allain,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390
I would tell you, Borja, we’re going

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.090
to do two-week cycles.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.930
Every two weeks we’ll ask you, please,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470
to come back to the beginning so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.890
that you can help us tell you what’

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.190
s next most important for you to

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.250
do and we’ll see you in 15 days

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.510
so you can see a functional demo

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.390
of what you said.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.030
In that functional demo you will have

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.610
the chance to see it and you will have

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.570
the chance to say, I didn’t like

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.690
this, this or another doesn’t seem to me.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.110
Now that I see this I know what I really

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.270
wanted and it is this or another.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.030
And all that feedback you incorporate

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.010
into the next cycle, with which you completely

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.630
mitigate the likelihood

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.050
that you don’t like something.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.490
As you are making several deliveries

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.370
every 15 days, every 15 days you realize

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.770
that the landing page wasn’t going

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.290
with the colors, you realize that America

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.210
didn’t express a sect, those

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.610
changes are being incorporated

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.810
into the development, so that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.930
when you arrive at the last

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.470
three months, all those problems

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.810
must be already corrected.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.130
Look, I’ll explain it with the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.190
two timelines, with the look and feel

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.510
theme or with something you don’

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.990
t like.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.210
So, in scenario A, if two months,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.090
three months pass and there is something

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.950
you don’t like, the look and feel,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.090
for example, the entire website,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.610
all pages within the website

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.690
have developed it with that

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.610
look and feel, with that whatever.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.930


00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.110
Instead in the B scenario, which

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.530
is the Jive, if we stay in two

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.570
weeks, in two weeks you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.230
present me the home and I don’

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.870
t like it, we only wasted

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.170
the work of the developers during

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.690
those two weeks, but the work

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.270
of the two weeks until the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.050
project ended x months ago

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.830
is recovered.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.790
This is the main thing about this method.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.610
Effectively, because in the A have

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.910
been working on something that

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.330
the customer, in this case the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.750
customer of the contract,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.750
even if the final customer,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.750
if we develop a product,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.570
does not like.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.010
For me, the difference is

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.890
fundamental and it is what makes

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.350
this methodology strong, that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.490
ability that everything you do is in

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.230
tune with the real need that is there

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.070
and not with something obsolete

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.130
or something that doesn’t like and

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.050
is not known at that time.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.370
I think that is the best

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.330
example to explain it.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.810
And in short, they are the long-

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.350
term ones we want, it is a level

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.770
of uncertainty, focus, that is, in

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.930
the next thing we will do to put

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.070
efforts there, sprint or short

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.370
cycles through feedback feeding

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.950
us and finally focused on

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.970
the customer, that is, the expertise

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.710
is the customer, who is in

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.150
the business is the customer

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.530
and whom I must meet is

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.050
him.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.990
The latter is learning, what

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.950
is called Lean Startup, validated

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.330
learning, that is, we will

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.890
improve as we validate our

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.570
for the customer.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.710
Perfect, so thank you very much.
