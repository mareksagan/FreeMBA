00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What is the use of the EBB?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
The EBB uses, and it does because it gives you a lot of information,

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
the typical traditional segmentation, geographical, where demographic lives by age.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
It is not the same a fragrance, a colony for someone over 50,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
that for someone young or psychographic profile,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
that is more modern, cosmopolitan, urban, I don't know.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
This is very important for a company like the EBB.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
They also added variables that helped them to understand more,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
that you already know, like the for what they buy,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
when they buy, where they buy, with what frequency.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
All those are variables that allow you to do many segmentations.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
They were a step further.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
And what they did is identify a series of specific customer.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
And in the end, this is the challenge,

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I have a lot of information, but I have to identify a series of customer that are useful to me,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
that allow me to adapt.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
And what customer was Silvia talking about?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
That called profiles.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
For example, the gifter, the traveler, the lover.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's go deeper how they got to that.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, the gifter is someone who buys you to make a gift.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
So, what EBB comes to the conclusion is that really the important thing,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
the important information, the important segmentation variable,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
in this case, is that he buys you to make a gift or not.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It is more important than the age he has or whatever.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
And when you understand that, when you understand that inside your clients

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
there is a specific customer, in this case, the gifter,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
you put the name of the gifter to understand him well,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and then you also analyze him.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And that is that the important thing of all the clients that are inside that customer,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
is that they are buying you to make a gift,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
because you can adapt a lot to them.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
You can adapt to all the formats of the fragrances,

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
you can adapt the packaging, I don't know, you can adapt the distribution, I don't know,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
because I'm not an expert in the sector, but you understand that he is buying you to make a gift

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
and that is the most important thing for you, more than the rest of the variables.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Or the traveler.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
It turns out that you discover that there are clients who buy you when they are traveling.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
In this case, what is the criterion to define a traveler?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
What is the sex, age or that it is cosmopolitan?

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
No, the criterion to define it, the variable used to define it is when he buys you.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
In this case, it turns out that he buys you when he is traveling.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
And that gives you a lot of information, because then you can adapt, for example, the distribution.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Or the formats, the distribution to the points of sale, for example, in Duty Free, for example.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Or the lover.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The lover is a lover of the brand.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Why are you segmenting the lover?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
For his tastes, for his profile?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
No, you are segmenting him because he is a lover of the brand.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
And since he is a lover of the brand, then you analyze him and it turns out that he would be willing to buy in subscription,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
that he likes to go to the point of sale from time to time and know the new colonies that have come out,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
but that he always buys in addition to the new ones, he buys the classic, etc. I don't know.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
But hey, what we can learn here is that to identify customer-persons,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
what you have to do is start from the variables that are most important to you.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
In this case, that, that he buys you to make a gift.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Or that he buys you when he is traveling.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Those variables that give you a lot of information that allow you to identify a customer-person

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
and then go deeper into him, analyze him, know him, etc., etc., etc.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And be able to adapt to him.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
Another interesting conclusion is that in this case they have identified several customer-persons

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
and the same person can be within several or can act as several.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Because you can be a lover of the OEB, but it also turns out that you are a gifter

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
because you use it at some point to make a gift.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Or you are a rashi, which is, I was talking about rashi,

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
which was one of those who buy you at the last moment or when they run out of options, etc., etc., etc.
