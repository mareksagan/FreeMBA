00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.470
I would like to know

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.170
what Media4Equity is.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.950
Media4Equity, as its name implies,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.510
basically consists of an

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.670
exchange between the media

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.970
that gives access to its inventory,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.730
i.e. access to television,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590
press, radio or other media

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.450
in exchange for shares

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.630
of a startup.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.270
Basically, it is a trade equation

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.730
where, in this world of venture

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.690
capital, the medium enters as

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.910
a more financial investor.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.810
The value of the medium, basically,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.290
there is a market value, which is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.150
worth a advertising campaign, so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.610
it is already a starting point,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.630
and while on the other hand

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.350
you are entering a round

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.310
of co-investment with other venture

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.530
capital investors, so there

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.490
is also a fixed relationship,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.350
so that if I give you a million

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.590
euros of advertising space and you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.990
give me a million euros of stock

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.190
value, which, in some way,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.350
helps the startup to rely on the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.950
know-how that this medium

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.250
can have, involvement by

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.050
being the first person of the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.010
middle, in many cases to a better

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.110
value than what would buy

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.250
it directly.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.590
This is a discount on whether the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.330
campaign has cost a million euros.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.230
You usually go with me with better

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.430
prices than you would if you

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.870
went on your own.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.690
This allows you to go further,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.170
feel accompanied, because in the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.670
end a startup is a big one,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550
the offline media world usually

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.990
gives them quite vertigo,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.070
quite fear, then, feeling

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.470
accompanied by people who are

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.110
already living the other worlds

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.370
in a contrasting way, helps

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.170
the landing be much more solid.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.990
That is, basically it is, as you have

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.190
said a word that is very representative,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.690
it is a swap.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.970
A startup comes at a time when it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.610
wants to continue to fund its growth

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.190
and has the option to raise more

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.130
capital, and with that capital,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.230
invest it in the means of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.190
capture it wants, online,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.290
offline, etc.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.890
But when there's a mid for equity,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.790
what you do is a part of that round,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.430
you make an agreement with a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.050
company like you, and what you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.650
do is a swap.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.410
That is.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.490
Instead of having to hire cash

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.270
those campaigns in different media,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.590
like radio, television, etc.,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.710
what it does is hire.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.930
And what are the advantages of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.510
doing so in this way, of making a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.290
mid for equity, compared to getting

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.770
the total funding in a round and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.410
then hiring it directly

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.330
to the middle?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.870
Basically, if you want to do

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.150
a mid for equity, whatever the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.710
medium you want, we are more in

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.930
the world of television, so we

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.830
think more about whether you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.210
really want to watch television,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.450
but it can also be with radio

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.150
or any other medium, if you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.950
are convinced you want to

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.550
do television and you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.970
know you want to do it, you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.030
will go...

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.090
It is the mid for equity.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.470
Why is it?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.650
Because you will have access

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.930
to better prices, you will have

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.610
first-hand access to a grid,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.550
that is, it can allow you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.390
to manage the grid better, seek

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.870
synergy with the medium in some

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.650
cases, and it will allow

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.110
you a know-how of someone specialized

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.970
that is an expertise

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.750
that there is not so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.250
much in the sector.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.410
That is, people who really from the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.810
offline world have enough experience

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.830
in the online world to know

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.110
how to combine both.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.810
So if I know or believe that the medium

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.470
you've told me, for example,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.090
is television, the midia for

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.630
equity makes a lot of sense.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.470
If, on the contrary, I have the option

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.390
to choose between a million euros

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.710
of cash and a million euros of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.810
money, and I am not 100% convinced

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.670
or 90% convinced, it is better

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550
to take the cash without any doubt

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.210
because it will give you that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.970
flexibility to be able to react.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.470
That is, a moment may be that

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.370
you may realize that what you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.370
need is a smaller campaign

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.610
or go building in a different

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.550
way or go combining media

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.270
but not necessarily a million

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.330
television, so it will give

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.410
you quite more flexibility

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.370
to catch the cash, but

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.650
you have to be more

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.850
or less convinced.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.410
You said three things that are very interesting.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.910
First, you have to be very clear

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.070
that your channel is television

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.230
at that time.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.130
If you are not sure, it is better not

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.250
to lose that flexibility.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.650
Two, if you have it clear, it is pure

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.010
common sense, if you have it clear that

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.470
you want to invest a million euros in

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.450
television, have the cash and invest

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.510
it and that the television

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.910
is almost a supplier, an agreement,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.670
etc., or that the television

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.130
or the medium that is in particular

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.510
is your partner.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.690
Obviously when it is your partner it

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.970
will accompany you much more, much

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.990
better and you will be in a better

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.090
position to negotiate, etc.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.150
Well, this is something that by pure

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.470
common sense, but everyone understands.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.190
And then you said another and it is that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.270
it allows you a greater reach.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.650
In many cases, it is not one or the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.330
other.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.910
That is, I will have access to two

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.870
million euros of funding

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.770
because I have come to convince

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.210
that growth partner that there

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.050
is and also my old partners

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.310
are accompanied by something,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.610
but I get to two million euros.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.670
So what you can get from

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.550
the TV is I'm going to do a

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.390
three-million round.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.290
In the case of the Spanish, it is not usually either

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.270
one or the other.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.790
It is an additional.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.650
It is usually an additional.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.230
You may raise the rating

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.990
slightly, but allow a more

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.830
ambitious round.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.730
In other international markets where

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.310
you get up easily or in a medium-

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.750
young round, you get up five

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.390
million, maybe television is

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.750
more complicated because

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.810
you have to choose either

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.950
television or any other medium

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.730
is more complicated.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.810
In Spain, given the type of round

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.930
financing that is in Spain, how

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.310
the sector is, how it is structured,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.670
it amplifies the round,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.630
especially.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.490
In fact, Spain has become, you

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.070
could say, probably the second

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.290
market in the world in freedom,

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.210
so you and after Germany,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.830
because it has fit with the

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.430
type of round investment

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.050
and what you are looking

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.770
for, what you need.
