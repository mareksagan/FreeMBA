00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the structure of capital?

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
The structure of capital is a very basic concept of finance and corporate finance that I think we should understand well.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
The first thing we are going to do is define the concept. What is the structure of capital?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Well, the structure of capital determines how we are going to finance the company.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Basically, what it determines is what proportion of debt and equity we are going to use.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
That is, here is a key ratio, which is the leverage ratio.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
The structure of capital determines the leverage ratio.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And why is this important? Why is the structure of capital important?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Because it has enormous implications on many things.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
Well, look, on the benefits in the result account, because we will pay more or less taxes.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
On the cash flows, the fact of obtaining debt or not, has great implications on the cash flows,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
entries, amortizations, etc.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
It has a huge implication on the risk it faces.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
On the risk of bankruptcy, for example, the fact of obtaining more debt increases the risk.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
And above all, and most importantly, what we are going to see is that the structure of capital determines the value of the company.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
And it is said that we have to look for an optimal structure of capital that maximizes the value of the company.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We are going to review two key concepts.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
One, the financial leverage.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
If we start from the assumption that we obtain a higher profitability at the cost of debt,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
the more we get into debt, the greater the profitability of our own funds.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
And two, the increase in debt entails an increase in cost.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
We have to build on these two concepts.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And we are going to see how this affects the valuation of the company.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
We are going to understand it very well with this graph.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
As we see, the company's valuation increases as leverage increases to a certain point.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
As we see, the trend is reversed.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
And we are going to understand it well.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Things I want you to remember.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, to begin with, investors prefer you to be leveraged.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Why?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Because the fact that you are leveraged will make the ROE increase,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
will make the shareholders' profitability increase.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
And I can give you real examples.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
If you do a round and raise, for example, 2 million euros.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Funds or investors will prefer that, in addition to those 2 million of equity,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
you can access bank financing, for example.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Why?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Because the equity profitability will increase.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And we see this well represented in the curve.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The company's valuation increases.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And if we think in a perfect world,

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
as we have seen, the leverage ratio makes the ROE increase,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
then what we would have to do is to leverage as much as possible.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
If we could leverage 99% and only 1% was equity,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
imagine the 3,000 euros of social capital.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, in those circumstances, the profitability obtained by the funds would be maximized,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
because they have put very little money.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, but here comes another factor, and that is the risk.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And this is very easy to understand too.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
How would you value a company that is leveraged at 99%?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It would scare you, right? You would perceive a lot of fear, a lot of risk.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And that what it does is decrease the value of the company.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Why?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Because investors demand very high profitability,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
and the cost of capital is very high in this case.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
It is pure common sense.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And not only investors, not only partners,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
but also debt providers, banks.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
If a bank has to lend money to a company that is leveraged at 99%,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
first I do not think it will lend it, but if it does,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
the risk is so high that the types of interest it requires,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
that is, the cost of the debt, would also increase a lot.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Therefore, as we see, the value of the company increases

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
if you are leveraging yourself to a certain point,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
to a point where you have exceeded a criterion of prudence,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
which depends on each of the sectors.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
There are sectors in which you can leverage more than others,

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
because you have more stable cash flows,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
because it is a business with less risk, etc.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And as, and the moment we have exceeded that limit, that range,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
in which we are assuming excessive risks,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
the value of the company will decrease.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Why?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Because both partners and debt providers will penalize it.
