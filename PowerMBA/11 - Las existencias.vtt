00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.340
Let's see how the stocks work.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.580
The first thing I want you to understand

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.280
is the concept.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.600
Existences are, explained in a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.680
simple way, what we have, see,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.920
raw materials, commodities,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.040
etc.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.940
And we did not sell.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.540
They are the raw materials,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.960
the commodities we have manufactured

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.620
or bought, but have not

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.400
yet sold.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.680
And they are still in our warehouse,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.760
in our company and therefore in

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.900
the balance sheet.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.080
In the current balance sheet, we

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.180
have them in the current asset.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.600
You probably already know it, because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.900
we've seen it before.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.840
It is one of the most common, most

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.580
important operating assets.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.660
And, in addition, I want you to know

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.880
that the calculation of the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.360
value of stocks affects the status

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.300
of results, affects the calculation

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.060
of the outcome of the exercise, here,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
in the cost of sales.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.400
That is why we are now looking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.060
at it, within the results section.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.980
We are looking for a

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.800
second-hand car sales

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.580
business.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.080
I will explain how stocks

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.020
work.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.400
We buy second-hand cars

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.320
and sell them.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.900
We bought a car.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.900
The first, we give a spending,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.460
buy goods, a spending worth $10,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.560
000 and that money goes out

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.540
of the bank.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440
We buy another car, in this case for 8,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.260
000, we return to a spending, we

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.680
already have a spending, we already

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.920
have for 18,000 and we buy another

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.960
car, in this case 11,000.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.730
We have already spent 29,000 euros

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.450
in this year.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.170
This year we have sold

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.790
nothing.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.210
This is an extreme case, but I want

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.270
you to understand it that way.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.630
We have sold nothing.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.430
Then we will calculate the result

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.710
of the exercise and we have sales

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.170
of zero minus the cost of sales,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.530
which would be those purchases

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.570
we made for a value of 29.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.770
000.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.570
The total amount of the exercise is 29,000.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170
We have a loss of 29,000.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.050
Is this real?

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.930
Is it logical?

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.330
Is it real?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.730
No is no.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.750
Why is?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
We have three cars.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.670
We have three cars worth

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090
29,000 euros that we have

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.590
not sold, but we have

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.210
them.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.090
They are the property of the company,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.230
they are an asset we have.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.350
Therefore, and I want you to stay with

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.030
this, we will only account for the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.070
purchase or expenses associated

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.630
with goods that we have already

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.430
sold as a cost to calculate the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.210
outcome of the exercise.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.110
If you haven't sold it, it's still

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.330
in the asset.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.610
You do not consider it a cost.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.770
It is quite logical.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.950
As I said, we have three cars.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.310
In that year, we lost

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.390
29,000 euros.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.030
Wouldn't it be real?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.090
We have an asset of 29,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.230
000 euros.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.390
This accounting works

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.430
in this way.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.830
At the end of the exercise,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.670
we create an asset account

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.270
that is the stock account

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.330
worth $29,000.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.450
And we will give a positive

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.270
income or result with the stock

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.070
variation account for the same

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.730
amount.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.230
Here you will see.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.630
What we do is wake you up.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.610
Look, we will see.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.290
We had a sales cost of 29,000 and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.870
now we have given an income,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.970
a positive result that compensates

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.230
those 29,000.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.210
Therefore, we will consider

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.470
that the cost of sales is zero.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.610
This year the profit was zero.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.210
Because we have sold nothing.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.770
The cost of sales

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.730
is zero.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.770
We will then move it to the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.970
balance sheet.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.170
Let us make a quick look.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.290
The important thing is this.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.210
We will only consider the expenditure

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.830
of the goods that leave the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.750
company, of the goods we sell.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.270
So, in the case we have

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.050
seen, buy selling cars,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.710
buy cars, we are spending

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.510
at that time.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.630
At that time we are spending.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.630
As you can see here,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.370
buying goods is a result account.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.430
But what we do is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.570
later, as we haven't sold

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.470
any, we adjust it.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.250
Why is?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.610
Because stocks have grown

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.290
by $29,000.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.390
So in the results state

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.150
we will not consider that

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.570
we bought 29,000.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.790
If not, we will consider

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.930
zero cost sales.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.990
Because we haven't sold them.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.210
And finally that asset we

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.050
have, which are the three cars,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.150
is in the current asset, in

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.150
the stock account.
