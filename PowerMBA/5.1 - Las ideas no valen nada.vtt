00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.020
I love this graphic because it

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.340
is very representative of many

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.140
things.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.160
We have in the axis of the X, forgiveness,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.720
of the Y, we have the courage and

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.740
the risk.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.440
And here we would have time.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.120
And we will draw two curves, the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.680
curve of value and the curve of risk.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.120
Look at this beautiful piece.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.960
The value will be green.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.280
When you have an idea, it is not worth anything,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480
we have said it a thousand times,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.280
parts of here.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.980
It really is not worth anything, donâ€™t be mistaken.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.340
What we need to do is increase

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.480
the value quickly.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.140
We will paint it like this and so on.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.200
This is the curve of value.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.260
Now we take the risk.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.300
At this point, risk and value

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.880
are always inversely proportional.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.880
At this point, the risk is very high.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.100
The chances of failure are

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.240
90%.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.000
What we need to do is reverse it.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.060
We have to reduce the risk and the risk

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.980
would go like that.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.080
In general, it is important to keep

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.300
in mind that this always happens.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.600
As you validate, learn,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.040
evolve a business model,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.980
you increase

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.580
value and risk

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.820
decreases.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.840
Here it is a high risk investment

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.460
and here it is a lower risk

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.180
investment.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.980
And thatâ€™s why there are investors

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.420
who like to go into different stages

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.640
looking for different returns.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.480
Well, what we have to be very

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.080
good is in this first phase,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.260
here.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.920
And here we will define the milestone that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.660
is Problem Solution Fit.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.200
This is the first of the Power

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.080
Launch Formula.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.260
How do we Problem Solution

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.900
Fit?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.240
How can we increase the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.440
value and reduce the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.840
risk?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.040
Well, validating the main

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.700
hypotheses of your business model,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.480
that at this point the most basic

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.760
are the problem, that there is the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.420
problem, that you have given

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.920
with a solution or with a value

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.620
proposal that solves or that, forgive

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.620
me, that gives response to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.140
that problem, that you want

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.000
to buy customers, etc.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.200
We will see it in detail.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.300
But what I want you to stay with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.020
is that if you do this very well in

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.240
very little time and spend

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
little money, you create a lot

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.980
of value because you go from having

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.060
something that is absolutely nothing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.960
worth something, well, that we have

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.240
already validated in the market

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.340
with customers that can make sense,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.060
is the basis for mounting a business

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.220
and above the risk is much

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.780
smaller.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240
At this point it makes sense,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.820
for example, that we look

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.980
for funding with the Full Friends

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260
and Family or it makes sense that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.480
you build, that you start building

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.620
a MVP, that I donâ€™t know, that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.620
you invest some money or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.820
that you leave your job.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.180
It makes sense here.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.060
Why is?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.160
Because the risk is not so high,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.360
the risk is not here, a middle

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.060
point of risk.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.980
What happens is that people do not

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.420
usually do it well and entrepreneurs

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.680
have an idea and instead of looking

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.020
for a problem solution fit, instead

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.340
of trying to validate the main

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.740
hypotheses, what they do is focus

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.160
on things that do not matter, because

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.100
they start here to look for financing

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.160
or what they do is look for

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440
suppliers, they do not validate

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.960
that there is a fit in the market,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.280
then what they do is not decrease

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.200
the risk, time passes, invest

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800
money and do not decrease

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
the risk nor increase

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.120
the value.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.530
So in short, what we will learn and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.930
what we will be very good is to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.090
create a lot of value in this initial

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.150
phase, validating the main hypotheses

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.330
to have a company that is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.190
worth something and also decrease

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.690
the risk so that when you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.810
start to take on something

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.270
more of risk, investment,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.110
etc., it really makes

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.270
sense.
