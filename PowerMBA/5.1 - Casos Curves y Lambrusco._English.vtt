00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.260
Today we will look at the case of the Ambrusco.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.160
It is a good case to continue

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
to reinforce the Blue Ocean

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.520
strategy, especially considering

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.840
that we are starting from

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.220
a real Red Ocean.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.580
Because I think you will be with me

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.300
Carlos in that the wine industry,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.100
and also, look at it, Richie, the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.680
CEO of Vintay, told us, is a very

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.440
very competitive industry, in

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.780
which it is very difficult

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.460
to differentiate and also very fragmented.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.320
With, if we talk about the wine industry

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.300
worldwide, we are talking about hundreds

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.480
of thousands of cellars in which

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.880
it is very difficult to really

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.020
stand out, differentiate yourself, etc.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.040
You just have to go to the lineal in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.660
a supermarket and good, see everything

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.940
there.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.140
If you put yourself in the role of

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.640
the cellars that are selling, that

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.760
are the owners of that wine, it

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.660
is clear that it is very complicated.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.800
And the Ambrusco is a good example

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.480
of how to think about non-customers,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.440
how to create value innovation, etc.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.760
Tell us a little about how

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
this strategic evolution is born.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
Well, in fact, the Ambrusco is a good

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.220
example of how in an industry it

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.060
is so saturated, as you say, to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.140
do something different thinking

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.480
about non-customer segments.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.700
What are the non-customer

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.560
segments, the main non-

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.900
customer segments for a wine

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.440
cellar?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.280
In general, all those people who

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.940
do not usually drink wine and do

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.700
not usually drink wine for many reasons.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.420
Because they do not know it well, because

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.360
they are not able to appreciate

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.540
it, because it gives them some shame

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.480
not to know how to choose a good wine

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.680
if it is in appropriate conditions

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.460
or not, because they do not like

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.480
to drink alcoholic beverages in general.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.620
Well, thinking about them, the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.880
Ambrusco appears with a very

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.700
different proposal to what exists

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.380
currently or existed at that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.480
time in the market.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.660
If we see the strategic picture and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.040
to summarize it, as the current

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.660
situation we see two curves of value,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780
the red, a reserve wine, a high-end

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.940
wine and therefore also high price,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.640
which without

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020
any but that also do not provide

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.280
a great differentiation.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.920
What are the factors or variables

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.240
in this sector really investing in?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.940
As we are seeing in the image, there

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:56.540
is a whole investment well in

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.480
bottle, in creating a brand in

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.420
the market that allows me to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.860
a certain degree of differentiation,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.540
some design, sometimes to have

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300
a designation of origin and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.800
for that I have to have my

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.960
vineyards in a certain area, etc.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.060
Well, all that is true that configures

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.700
different value proposals for those

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.640
who appreciate wine, but if

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.580
we think of a segment of customers

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.740
who usually do not drink

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.620
wine for the reasons that he

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280
said, we see in the image

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.380
the value curve, the Ambrusco

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.180
value proposal.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.100
If we analyze a little how it has been

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.160
playing with the different

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.080
variables, we see that in price it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080
has opted to think of a non-drinker

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.820
of wine with an affordable price,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.400
logically we will hardly convince

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.300
someone who does not drink wine

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.120
if we offer a very high price

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.940
for the bottle.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.120
The brand does not seem very reasonable

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.780
to invest in it in a segment,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.540
I insist, that a priori has

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.580
little interest in wine.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.360
Years in barrels I don’t want to

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.620
tell you, it doesn’t take 30 minutes

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.300
in a barrels, because we really

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480
go to a segment that neither

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.180
appreciates it nor sees

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.700
value.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.940
Of course, I understand Carlos

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.300
that this particular factor, the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.060
fact that in the processes

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.620
that ageing is much less, that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.140
there is no barricade, has

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.200
to have a huge impact on the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.160
decrease in costs.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.400
Of course, in effect, part of that decrease

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.800
is taken to the price and another

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.960
part without any better profitability.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440
Because, for example, the design,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.700
I’m seeing the design, well, it’

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.820
s true that you decrease the design,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.560
but well, the design in the end

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.860
is not a cost factor I understand

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.460
that where innovation is really

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.680
here is in simplifying

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.280
the processes of wine making,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.380
which is basically aging.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.420
And the brand investment too, because

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.880
in some way it is something that

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.060
does not impact, in which a non-

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.460
drinking customer of wine is decided

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.760
with a brand, again the variety

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.540
of offer also, a lambrusco, because

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.080
we have mainly pink wine with

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.880
a little needle, some white

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.480
and some red, but mainly a variety

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.200
very focused on pink wine.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.860
What you say about the variety

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.580
of supply is a factor that

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.200
also has a cost impact on

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.120
all animal industries, i.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.500
e. on products.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.040
I spoke recently with a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480
watch maker from one of the leading

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.680
companies worldwide and I told

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.720
you that they have a lot of

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.740
watches, a lot of models of

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.460
watches and I spoke, for example,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.780
that Rolex was selling the submariner,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.360
because it has sold millions and

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.560
millions of that model and, of course,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.260
when you get to have a very little

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.540
variety of offer, effectively,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.980
in your profitability they are

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.720
much higher and, in this case,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.600
the cellars usually have white,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.720
red, well, they have very

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.820
different types of wines,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.300
that is and the lambrusco,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.040
because what it has is, you

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.220
said, there are two or something

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.500
like that.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.640
Well, mainly pink, as I said, if you

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.660
are able to aggregate and concentrate

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.000
your supply in two or three maximum

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.120
products, in the end it is infinitely

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.360
more profitable because economies

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.880
of scale are produced than when

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.560
you fragment your portfolio a lot,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.340
because it complicates much more.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.000
In return and thinking again for

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.040
non-drinkers of wine, we

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.540
find that lambrusco makes a slightly

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.160
different use, it is a wine easy

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.800
to drink, easy to choose,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.860
in general, with that it is fresh

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.760
is more than enough for it

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.420
to be well, that is found in

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.700
supermarkets.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.320
Well, because we see a value

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.700
proposal that, without being the best

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.940
wine, there are people who would even

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.280
say that it doesn’t even get to be

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.080
wine, it is undoubtedly the best wine

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.860
value proposal for the non-drinkers

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.400
segment.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.500
That is, if we saw it from the point

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.620
of view of the rice maltrease,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.940
what has decreased a lot are the

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.060
factors of brand, ageing,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.740
design, design and so and then

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.880
what they have done is to create

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
some, create factors that never,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.640
that the rest of the cellars, is

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.940
that they never had taken into account,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.780
because a cellar has never taken

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720
into account that their wine is

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.240
easy to drink or easy to choose,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.000
they compete in other things,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.540
compete in the rest of What has

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.220
done the Ambruso is to reduce all

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.300
the aspects that generate cost

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.140
and increase everything that

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.900
favors a different use or facilitates

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.520
the use of the drink, with a cost

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.140
that also generates little impact,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.180
because the easy choice or

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.960
that is an easy product

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.920
to drink does not generally

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.100
impact the cost.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.680
You can think that it is a better

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.460
or worse wine, this is a matter of

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.060
opinions, but the important and relevant

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.560
thing is that more than 40 million

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.200
bottles are sold a year and this

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.800
is exactly what it is about, making

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.820
a wine that is the best wine for

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.660
the segment we are addressing, remember

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.140
the non-drinkers and that also

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.740
generates a business of the

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.300
volume we have commented on.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.020
Indeed, if we ask people of industrial

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.220
wine sure that many are many fans,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.620
they will tell us what you said,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.720
it is that it is a very bad wine,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.400
it is not that it is a bad wine,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.680
it is good that the Ambruso

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.480
is a wine, you fixed it

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.640
thought for not drinkers

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.960
of wine.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.390
For that segment it is possibly

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.650
better than any other wine we could

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.750
find in the market no matter how

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.650
expensive it is.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.410
Effectively and in addition it is

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.610
that it is very bright to go to

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.990
non-drinkers of wine, because the rest

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.650
of cellars that are hundreds of

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.810
thousands of cellars in the world are

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.930
all competing for the drinkers

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.550
of wine, then if you decide to go

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.530
to those who are not drinkers and above

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.910
you get them to capture because

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.670
your proposal squares them, well

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.970
because it is when you have created

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.490
a blue cerano and when you manage

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.930
to sell 40 million bottles

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.730
that is a barbarity.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:10.510
actually is.
