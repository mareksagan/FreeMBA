00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.160
Before I start with Power Launch Formula,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.180
I want to make a reflection

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.720
that is very important about

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.220
the approach, because it has

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.300
a lot to do with how Power

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.840
Launch Formula is set up.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.620
And it's that the usual approach

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.940
people think is that they

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.400
undertake that the germ is an idea.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.520
The focus is you have an idea, usually

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320
what people do is fall in love with

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.740
that idea, execute that idea,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680
and that what does it take you to?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.520
It leads you to failure in

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.620
90% of cases.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.380
That is what the statistics say.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.000
It's funny, you see entrepreneurs

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.340
doing that, right?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.140


00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.000
They fall in love with an idea,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.940
think they have got the Coca-

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.120
Cola formula, often they don't want

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.580
to tell it because they think

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.880
it's unique and they can

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.740
copy it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.960
It's between funny and ridiculous,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.060
because when you have a little perspective

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.220
you realize that that idea,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.200
not that idea but the ideas,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.800
are worthless.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.000
The other day I read from an investor

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220
in Silicon Valley that the ideas

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.300
are not worth the paper on which

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.860
they are written, and of course

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.940
they are not worth the time she

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.460
spent listening to them.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.580
And it may sound a bit extreme,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.240
but it's so, because really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.660
when you've seen many projects,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.820
when you've seen many projects

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.560
fail, you realize that an idea,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.080
the idea at that moment when

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.860
someone has an idea, even if

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.760
it's good, maybe hasn't advanced

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.400
even 1%.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.360
Imagine if of the projects that are

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.240
born, of those that are born, when

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.620
people have invested time and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.500
so, 90% failure of the ideas that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.540
people have at that time, what

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.660
is the value?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.420
How much has it advanced?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.160
Not even 1 percent, I am sure.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.980
And it is that you have probably heard

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.960
a thousand times, no, because I also

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780
thought about setting up Facebook or

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.920
I also thought about doing something

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.100
like Glovo, everyone has had

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.820
many ideas.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.740
But how many people have done it?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.600
How many people have successfully executed it?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.400
Very few of them.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.940
The conclusion at the end, I will

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.060
go back to the same, ideas are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.700
worthless.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.680
We believe that focus is not an

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.660
idea and executing it, the focus

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.020
or formula to success is different.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.180
It has to start from your commitment,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.620
to undertake, to your dreams,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.200
etc.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.580
It doesn't part of an idea, it has to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.620
start from your commitment, it's very different.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.540
When you are aware of this, when

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.620
you are aware that everything

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.100
is part of your commitment to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.560
a dream, to change your life,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.200
but not the idea you have

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.900
at that moment, you gain

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.700
objectivity and probably face

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340
it in a different way.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.600
So let's think, if almost all

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.180
ideas fail, if ideas are worthless,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.340
if the important thing

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.820
is execution, what can we

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.300
do to those dreams, those

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.060
dreams, that vision?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
To become, if that's what we want,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.080
a successful entrepreneur

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.760
or entrepreneur.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.440
We have to test many ideas

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.380
and very quickly.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.240
If each of the ideas has little

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.620
chance of becoming a successful

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.820
model, what we have to do is,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.160
in the medium term, try out

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.700
many ideas and very quickly.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.680
That's what Powerlands Formula

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.720
is going to do.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
You can see it more or less

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.500
graphically, right?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.960
This is what happens over

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.600
time.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.880
This is what has happened to all

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.180
successful entrepreneurs who have

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.960
had many ideas and have taken the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.980
first steps.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.380
And if you are good at this, if what

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.620
you get is to validate it as soon

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.900
as possible and invest as little

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.820
money and time as possible, you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.840
can discard more.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.040
Accelerate this process.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.920
Of course, if you fall in love with

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
the first idea you have, you ruin

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.020
yourself, five years pass, you spend

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.400
it fatal, because you almost have

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.560
no room to recover.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.120
But if we are very good

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240
and try out many ideas it is like a lab.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.600
And so we have set it up.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.300
I'll give you the example of Nebula,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.040
who are some of our friends.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.840
Well, Kike and Dani, whom you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.060
will know, they have invested money

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.580
in creating a laboratory in which,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.500
applying just this approach,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.060
like a laboratory in which they

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.900
quickly validate many ideas.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.500
That with the synergies they have

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.180
in terms of the knowledge they

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.120
have, the means they have, allows

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.320
them to make a percentage of those

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.340
ideas come forward.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.160
But those who do not go ahead have

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.880
not ruined them because it has not

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.420
involved much effort in time and money

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.000
to validate them.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.400
So, therefore, what you have

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.720
to do, if that's your vision,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.560
if you're eager to create something

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.660
innovative, disruptive, etc.,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.820
what you have to do is get on the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.920
way as soon as possible.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.480
Don't block yourself because you don't have

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.620
an idea, because we'll help you.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.120
Don't fall in love with your current ideas.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.140
Learn the method, the formula.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.940
And put yourself on the road because

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.600
the sooner you do, your first

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.700
idea doesn't work or what you need

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.760
to do is that idea you have

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.280
in that model.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.460
We will have to evolve it, to pivot

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.760
it many times, whatever it is.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.520
But the sooner you get on the road,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.580
the sooner you will that dream.
