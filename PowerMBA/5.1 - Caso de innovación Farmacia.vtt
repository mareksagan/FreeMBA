00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.940
Carlos, I propose that we

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.320
focus on one of the ideas you have

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.620
given, which is to grow within

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.820
a segment of customers that are

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.120
the Runners and also incorporate

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.180
sales of services, that is,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.540
we would be solving several of

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.480
the weaknesses you had identified,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.240
because what I would like is

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.960
that you make us see how Canvas

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.140
helps us model an innovation,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.800
that is, you have an idea,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.480
but it is that the idea, at

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.220
the time you change something

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.540
within a block, this impacts

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.880
the rest of the business

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.940
model blocks, and this allows

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
you to model or even

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.900
manage your evolution.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.580
Indeed, we'll see the impact

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.160
on the two blocks of the model

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.840
that has the thought of a pharmacy

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520
office for the Runners.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.300
Now we can talk about a specific

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.120
segment of customers to whom

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.720
our pharmacy office will offer

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.940
a differentiated value proposal.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640
So come, let's see.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.780
Well, if we think of an

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.000
evolution of our business model

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240
by focusing on a new segment of

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120
customers that are the Runners,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.080
we'll see the impact a change

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.920
like this has on the rest

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.900
of the model.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.380
The most important thing, once

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.800
we have defined a new segment,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.480
is to build a product and service

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.060
proposal suitable for that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.160
segment.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.240
Thinking of the Runners, there

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.740
are many new services and products

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.520
that we could incorporate into

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.720
our pharmacy so that we

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.100
really had a differentiated

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.040
value proposal.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.640
However, there is one that is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760
relevant and on which we will be

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.540
based to see how to model the rest

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740
of the campus, which would

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.240
be the study of the footprint in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.080
this segment of customers

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.780
oriented to improve their

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.740
efficiency when running.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.220
Once we have incorporated this

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.500
footprint studio as a trunk

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.140
element for this customer

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.380
segment, derived from this

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.060
we could also offer shoes

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.960
and tailored templates.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.760
I insist that here we could

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.460
incorporate many more products

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.980
and services, but basically if

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.620
we focus on these, this would

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.320
give us the power to generate

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.600
new income flows derived

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.640
from this service and these

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.820
new side products we have

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.180
mentioned.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.590
If we continue to see the impact this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.850
change in the model would have on

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.970
the different blocks, we find

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.350
ourselves with distribution channels.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.690
We should think about how to reach

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.950
this segment of customers to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.230
offer this service.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.930
Yes, because what I'm thinking is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.330
that the runners are either able to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.470
establish new channels of capture

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.190
or distribution or it's very complicated,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.990
because runners from all over the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.290
city, I think you would be

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.410
able to attract them, what I think

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.730
is they won't know, so you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.030
have that challenge.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.090
Well, then we'll see how to get

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.750
to them to communicate our new

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.530
value proposal, but thinking about

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.090
channels that would always

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.470
help us have a greater reach

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.070
in the market, I think

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.490
gyms could be perfectly

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.070
a valid channel that will

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.830
market this service.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.750
Gymnases not only of our area and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.290
even of the rest of our geographical

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.370
area of influence, in the extent

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.170
that we are offering a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.490
service already very differentiated.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.870
Logically, in order to offer

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.270
this service we will need

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.250
a specific equipment for this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.030
footprint study and an expert

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.490
that we have today in our pharmacy

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.610
office.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.990
This would mean making an investment

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.930
and therefore taking a risk that

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.530
is not necessary in principle.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.870
I here always propose that we

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.110
begin with the externalization

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.410
of this type of additional

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.170
resources, both human

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.470
and equipment.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.170
Once we have proven that

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.790
our business model works

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.150
well, we can incorporate

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.270
them as clear resources.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.410


00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.630
And we could also think of

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.230
other gyms that might not

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.770
be interested in marketing

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.990
this service, but that they

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.350
would prescribe us

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.190
and recommend us to their

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.950
clients to approach our

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.570
pharmacy office.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.970
If we continue to analyze different

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.410
changes in the model, we have to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.950
get to those runners, identify

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.090
them, know where they are, build

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.530
a differentiated value proposal,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.750
we will have to incorporate

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.330
a certain marketing activity that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.310
gives form to this value proposal

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.570
and that allows us to go

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.650
to the market to communicate it.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.650
And in this context and for this

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.450
segment of customers such as runners,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.450
generally young people, middle-

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.110
aged people and therefore using

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.150
new technologies, I think that

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.730
one way to communicate, as I

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.370
said at the beginning, this value

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.130
proposal would be social networks,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.930
or have a Facebook page,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.610
or build a blog specific

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.790
to this segment of customers.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.910
And here just a nuance, I always

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.510
say that when a blog is built

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.850
from a pharmacy office we have

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.170
to be as specific as possible,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.910
a blog for the runners, because

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.450
if in our blog we mix an article

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.090
that can interest this segment,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.250
but the next day one of ordinary

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.950
incontinence because we

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.590
are losing the focus

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.110
on the segment and we would

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.370
make people cease to

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.410
have interest.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.930
The more specific we are, the more

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.250
value we will bring and the more communication

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.330
and attraction of potential

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.710
customers we will have.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.850
Well look Carlos, already to finish

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.810
it seems to me that the exercise

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.410
we have done is very enriching,

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.790
because what has helped us to see

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.010
is as from an idea that was we will

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.290
incorporate, we will go to the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.270
runners, well because you have

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.210
described us very well, we have

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.210
seen as the implication that it

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.390
has in the rest of the business

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.250
model, and I what I propose to all

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.870
the meetings of Power MBA is that

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.570
from now on when they have an

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.530
idea they turn it on the canvas,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.310
or when they have a new idea

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.050
or an evolution of a current business

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.310
model, for example of their

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.450
current company or whatever, that

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.550
they do this exercise, that they

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.350
identify what are the implications

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.590
that have the rest of the business

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.630
model, because in some cases

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.370
it is likely to come to the

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.410
conclusion that simply

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.130
doing this exercise

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.950
that your idea is not viable.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.330
Imagine for example that in key

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.570
resources it results that

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.950
we need a capital or an investment

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.490
that we do not have, for example,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.430
or that we have to establish

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.570
agreements with a distribution

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.850
channel that will never make us

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.090
a case, I don't know, I think about

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.090
the move.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.270
In any case, I think it is very convenient

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.450
to do this exercise whenever someone

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.930
has an idea, an evolution,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.010
etc., who wants to innovate

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.270
in something.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.850
That is, as you say, I think

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.390
it's worth having this global

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.890
strategic vision of how our

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.890
future business model would

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.110
be, but as you said, I always

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.030
recommend spending 20 minutes

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.790
to see why it might not work.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.590
This sometimes saves us a lot of

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.590
time to see the disadvantages or

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.570
handicaps before we throw ourselves

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.650
into an illusionary new business idea.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.870
I am very grateful for

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.790
this, and here we end the

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.690
case of the pharmacy.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.870
very well.
