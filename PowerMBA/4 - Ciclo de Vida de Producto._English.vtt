00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.720
In this class we will learn

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.520
how a product evolves throughout

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.380
its life, from birth

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.200
to death.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.880
We will look at a model that

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.320
is the product’s life cycle.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.100
It is a very well-known theoretical

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560
model and you have to know that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.020
what it does is to describe or

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.800
anticipate or predict the stages

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.100
or phases through which every

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.880
product passes and how it works

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.380
in each of those stages, how sales

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.080
work, how competition works,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.960
what decisions the companies

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.200
that are inside have to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.140
take, etc.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.640
Knowing well and understanding

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.720
the product life cycle helps

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.940
to understand how a business generally

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.840
works and how the competitive

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.340
environment works.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.820
I want you to understand that when

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.220
we talk about a product we are not

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.960
talking about the product itself,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660
we can apply it to a category

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.620
of products, we can apply a brand,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.800
we can apply it to a business

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.840
in general.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.060
Here is the graphic representation

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.400
of the life cycle.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.660
As you can see, we will draw

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.980
a curve with the evolution

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.260
of sales over time.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.460
There are four phases.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.740
The introduction phase, the growth

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.360
phase, the maturity phase and

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.500
the decline phase.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.680
Sales at the beginning of the introduction

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.720
phase are growing slowly.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.960
Really the demand has not yet validated

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.860
the product.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800
There are few buyers, maybe

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.720
a few early adopters.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.220
Later, a few years later or a

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.820
time later, because the duration

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.960
of the phases is very variable,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.380
depending on each

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.400
product, we enter a growth phase.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Sales are shaking, demand is shaking,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.220
a lot more people, millions

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.560
of people are incorporated into

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.420
demand.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.920
And then there comes a maturity

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.040
phase because that market

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340
cannot grow endlessly.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.200
A time comes when all demand

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.020
has accessed that product

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900
and from that moment sales

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.860
grow vegetatively, by pure

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.160
renewal.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.440
And there comes a time when products

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.260
enter the decline phase.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.800
Because there are substitute

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.620
technologies or changes in

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.480
tastes or consumer patterns,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.680
there are a number of circumstances

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.640
that make demand slow

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.620
down a lot.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.260
Let’s look at the evolution of the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.920
life cycle, for example, with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800
a product like tablets.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.600
Remember when Apple started promoting

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.040
its iPad.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.920
We are talking about the introduction phase.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.300
There were a lot of skeptical people.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.720
People say, but what is

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.380
it for?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600
Very few people bought at

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.780
the beginning, the first months.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.260
The introductory phase, as

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.860
we see, the sales curve was very

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.660
flat.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.400
But suddenly it seems that the market

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.060
started to convince the general public.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.380
He was shot and entered the growth phase.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.280
Sales went up for a year or

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.900
two, maybe two years and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.400
more competitors entered.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.820
But there came a time when the market

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.880
could not grow any more.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.680
In almost every household that was

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.000
targeted public already had a tablet

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.220
and is currently in the maturity

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.880
phase.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.860
It is no longer growing like during

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860
those two years when sales shot.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.680
It is in the maturity phase and will continue

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.160
for a long time.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400
Now it is a normal, stable, mature

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.420
market and will come a day when it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.020
enters a decline phase because there

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.240
will be technology that is substitutive.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.920
It is still a long time, but it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.220
will come someday.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.200
In the introductory phase, we could

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.800
say that there are current technologies

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.120
such as augmented reality or

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.540
virtual reality or 3D printing.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.260
They are very likely to

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.020
be mass-use technologies in a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.040
while, but they are still in the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.080
introduction phase.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.940
In the growth phase, we could

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.560
say smartwatches, for example,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.460
are not selling as much as

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.320
you might expect, but well,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.780
they are in the growth phase.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.840
Every day we see more.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.420
A product that is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.380
clearly in the growth

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.560
phase is the electric car, which,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.320
like smartwatches, was probably

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.080
expected to be more vertical,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.440
but there are a number

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.440
of circumstances that

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.520
slow it down.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.920
There are many sectors in maturity.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.720
Smartphones are in the maturity

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.520
phase or traditional sectors like

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.820
fashion, for example.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.340
And in the decline phase, let’s see

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.760
some example of a very drastic

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.220
decline, DVDs.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.940
Technology changes and there

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.680
are products like the DVD that are almost

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760
unusable or the fixed phone.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.960
Every day it is used less.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.940
I want us to analyze the life

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.140
cycle from a number of different

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.060
perspectives.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.320
It will be very enriching.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.120
We will see how the profitability

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.500
of companies evolves as they

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.740
advance in the life cycle,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.900
the profitability is very

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.740
related to unit costs.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.200
In the introduction phase, you

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.740
think that when a new product comes

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.180
out to the market, companies still

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.940
do not benefit from economies

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.180
of scale, manufacture in small

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.740
sizes and also have little

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.820
time with those technologies,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.540
so they are not efficient.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.820
The unit costs are very high and

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.000
the profitability is very low.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.720
He also thinks that those companies

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.840
are doing what they are investing

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.040
a lot to grow, so at that time

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.160
they are not profitable.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.480
Profitability is achieved in

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.640
the growth phases, when sales

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.920
are rising a lot.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.780
Companies begin to be profitable

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.000
there and in the maturity

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.560
phase the competitors who

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.300
remain in the market, those who

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.000
are made with a good market

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.920
share become very large companies,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.240
with huge economies of scale

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.060
and usually very profitable.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.660
Now we are in the smartphone

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.500
market.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.580
There have been many big and

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.600
probably profitable.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.310
We will finally examine how

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.210
the competitive strategy works

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.730
throughout the life cycle.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.450
We’ll see how many competitors there

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.750
are in each phase and how they have

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.590
to compete, what they have to focus on.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.990
In the introduction phase, if you think

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.190
of it, there are usually very few

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.450
competitors, sometimes there is only

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.490
one, it is the one who has innovated,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.850
the one who has created the product.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.690
At that time, the competitors

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.750
who are present in the market what

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.250
they have to do is spend a lot

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.690
of money in marketing to make

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.790
this product known because

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.830
still very few people know

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.810
it and there comes a time when

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.350
sales start to grow.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.270
The lawsuit has validated that

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.650
product and has validated that it

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.870
is willing to pay for it.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.310
Sales are growing, profits

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.710
are growing, and what’s happening?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.130


00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.730
It always happens the same, because there

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.330
are other companies that are attracted

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.590
by that profitability and by that

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.490
business opportunity to enter the market.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.090
When sales of the iPad jumped,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.590
other technology manufacturers

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.190
began to manufacture tablets.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.250
At this stage, it is still

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.610
a great growth potential.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.090
The challenge here is to invest a lot in

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.170
marketing to grow as much as possible

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.810
and in addition is that you can do

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.230
so, that is, the investment is very

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.810
profitable because there is still potential.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.650
Invest, grow, invest, grow, it

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.950
is like a race, it is like a race

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.150
to reach the maturity phase in that

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.650
of the maturity phase because it

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.950
is convenient to invest long before

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.150
reaching maturity because it

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.390
is easier to grow in this phase

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.070
that there is still potential

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.710
for growth, but then we arrive

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.670
in the maturity phase.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.530
In the maturity phase we already

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.370
know what the size of the market

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.750
is that a cake is distributed

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.030
among different competitors.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.830
Growing in this environment is

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.030
much more complicated because you

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.830
have to steal it from the competition

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.390
and then here is when we talk

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.510
about a red ocean, the competitive

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.930
war is much greater, price

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.150
wars, micro segmentation,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.150
continuing need for differentiation

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.570
or product development,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.530
etc.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.770
What happens in mature markets is

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.830
that there are companies that become

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.470
very large, others disappear

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.930
and some remain with niches,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.650
they become profitable in niches.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.550
Large companies with a high

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.410
market share usually

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.310
become highly profitable

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.450
companies.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.610
Finally we reach the cleave phase.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.190
At this point things get ugly because

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.650
the product is almost no longer

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.630
in demand in the market.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.890
Companies have to do it or they are able

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.890
to reinvent themselves or they have

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.150
to go out because otherwise they

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.190
will all die.
