00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.560
Today you will meet a very special

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.540
company.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.680
And in addition, we will get to know her

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.220
from the hand of her CEO, Richy, who in

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.940
addition to a good friend of mine,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.800
is an entrepreneur with a huge business

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.280
vision, in addition to a great leader.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.120
Richy will tell us what has been the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.100
innovation in the business model

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.840
that is allowing them to grow sustainably

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.740
more than 30% annually in a very

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.540
mature market, such as the wine

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.980
market, in which it is very

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.780
complicated to grow and win market

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.600
share by stealing customers

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.200
from your competitors.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.060
After listening to Richy, what

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.600
we will do is analyze what

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
we have learned with

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.180
the Business Model Campus tool.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.770
Could you explain to us what

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.230
the other innovations have been,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.110
or what the innovations in

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.590
the model you consider you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.370
have brought to you?

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.230
Look, one of the most important

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.130
pillars of our business model,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.550
which represented a very strong

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.030
innovation when we started,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210
was that the world of wine is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.090
a very patrimonialist business.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.490
As we understand it, it is a business

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.730
in which the winer has been in

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.090
mind that has to have its cellar,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.370
its vineyard, it is a model very

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.310
focused on the product or production,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.870
in the jargon of marketing.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.470
And when we started, we realized

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.730
that it didn't necessarily

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.570
have to be so.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.570
Are the resources required

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.850
of a cellar usually?

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.270
Which are they?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.190
Well, what we have in mind as normal

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.290
is to have the vineyard own, have

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.010
the facilities, the cellar with

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.130
its deposits, with its barrels

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.350
and everything own.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.170
And well, because that's one

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450
of the things we saw that why

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.210
it had to be so.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.690
That is, somehow when we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.770
arrived we had a facility

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.950
that came from the family

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350
company, in Rio Oje and others,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.110
but we wanted to make

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.910
wine in other denominations.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.770
If you have to buy 10 hectares

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.950
to build a new project, you have

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.610
to invest millions of euros in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.130
facilities, because in some way

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.390
it is a limiting of your creativity

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.970
and your entrepreneurship.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.790
At the same time we realized, it is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.430
also true that it coincided with

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.750
the crisis, the beginning of the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.670
crisis, that was our professional

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.870
start, in Spain at that time

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.750
and still today, because the cellars

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.830
have this mentality, there

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.530
was a lot of excess of installed

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.590
capacity.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.830
We found many cellars that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.450
had loose capacity in their

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.570
facilities and we said,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390
hear, why not break with

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.910
this?

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.530
And for us, in some way, which

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.950
of the parts we thought

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.330
were the most important?

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.530
Making a quality product, but it is

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.770
not related to having a cellar

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.310
of your own.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.790
You can work with a wonderful cellar

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.910
and don't necessarily have

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.870
to build it yourself or buy it.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.450
Effectively, the customer values

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.890
quality, values that you are able

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.070
to communicate in some way those

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.230
values that the wine has and then,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.130
of course, it is very important,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.410
in such a fragmented sector,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.230
since a commercial team.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.910
That is, for us those three

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.530
pillars, quality, sales team

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.050
and somehow marketing and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.630
communication, were things

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.090
much more important beyond

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.770
real estate, than what

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.450
was investment.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.810
That was a very important part.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.210
Then we have always spoken

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.070
at the business model level

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.650
of the concept 360 degrees, which

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.450
is somehow that we do not bring

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.710
to the market any wine or any

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.190
project that has us, on the one

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.690
hand, that story, on the other

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.170
hand, that label that communicates

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.490
it, the four P's, somehow

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.190
that are aligned or you need

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.110
to have a story that that label

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.090
communicates it and that is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.270
aligned also with the strategy

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.470
and, finally, the experience.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.410
That is, this is, the fourth leg

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.370
is somehow the one we are developing

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.970
now, but it is the leg in which

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.210
we want that in the world of wine,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.250
which in some way is such an

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.490
aspirational world,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.850
that it is representing

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.970
the values of the field and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.710
nature, because that also

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.310
the consumer has the possibility

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.070
to experience

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.430
it in the first person.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.290
So that's another of the important

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.550
things we consider within

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.650
the business model.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.680
We will now analyze what Richie

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.700
has told us and we will relate

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.360
it to the Business Model Canvas.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.540
The first thing we're going to do

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.840
is analyze the business model of

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.480
a traditional cellar and Richie

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.860
has given us some clue.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.780
He told us that he, his sector,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.520
is present in a very patrimonialist

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.360
sector, where cellars have traditionally

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.380
put a lot of focus on having

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.220
the assets, that is, with

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.660
the cellar, what Richie called

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.040
Real Estate, the real estate,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.500
or also with the vineyards.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.260
What implications does this have?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.040
Well, the implication is that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.780
in addition to that management,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.460
if you are, if you focus on the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.860
management of the asset, you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.920
can not focus on another series of

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.640
things, but above all it limits

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.760
your growth because you need

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.980
a lot of resources to grow

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.060
because you have to finance

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.240
the purchase of those assets.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.960
And we will analyze what has been the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.040
innovation in VinTea's business model,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.240
although the truth is that Richie

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.420
has made it very easy for us.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.080
Well, the first thing that tells us

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.340
is that they have grown in some of the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.560
cases, not always, they have not supported

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.360
themselves in the purchase of an asset

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.300
cellar or vineyard, what they

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.400
have done is to support third companies

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.840
that provide them that, therefore,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.480
the assets go from key resources

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.340
to a strategic alliance.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.800
And this allows them, in addition

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.140
to growing much faster, to be present

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.060
in very many denominations

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.800
of origin, well, because focusing

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.420
on other things that Richie considers

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.300
more important, and has told

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.620
us several, the quality, the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.320
brand, the distribution channel,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.060
the commercial force, the relationship

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.760
with customers, we talked about

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.700
making partisans to customers,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.100
well, are the strategic pillars

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.900
of VinTea, but that allows it

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.940
the fact of being a more flexible

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.320
and lighter company, which

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.040
does not have to permanently

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.920
finance the purchase

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.020
and management of those assets,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.680
but that it focuses on what

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.460
they consider to be important

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.220
really and that ultimately

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.340
is the customer.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.000
All this has allowed you not only

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.040
to grow much faster, but to bring

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.780
a customer value superior

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.220
to your competitors.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.280
Why is it?

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.440
Because it focuses on that, because

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.440
it has analyzed its business model,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.740
it has innovated, it has considered

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.740
that, unlike all the cellars in

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.760
the world that believe assets

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.960
are something vital, they rely

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.540
on third companies, so they are

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.960
lighter and allows them to

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.200
focus on what truly brings

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.860
value.
