00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.900
It is important, before you start,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.680
that you know well what the different

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.320
stages are, what we will

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.120
in each stage and why.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.820
Here is the scheme.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.200
We start with the identification

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.080
of viable ideas that we will

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.540
turn into a business model and

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.280
then what we will do is go validating,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.380
go evolving that business

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.160
model.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.480
How is?

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.240
For the first thing talking

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.060
to customers, then we will

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.560
do very quick experiments and once

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.000
we have reached the first of the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.280
milestones, which is problem,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.520
solution fit, what we will do is

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.960
build our minimum viable

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.100
product that we will improve.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.220
It is a process of a continuous

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.840
learning cycle until it reaches

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.200
product market fit.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.580
We start with the first of the stages,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.900
which is the identification of

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.340
ideas.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.040
We always say that ideas are worthless,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.940
but it is an indispensable requirement.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.140
Without ideas, we cannot start.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.420
So, that’s why we’ve incorporated

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.440
this module in which we’

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.920
ll help you identify

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.080
opportunities.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.220
And we do it from a triple

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.220
perspective, because ideas

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.840
can arise in different ways.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.020
The first is to look from the customer’

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.260
s perspective.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.600
What we do is try to identify

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.680
whether there are problems and the more

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.160
serious and more people have them,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.920
the better, to which no one has

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760
been able to give an optimal solution.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.920
Or, for example, what we will do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.140
is identify if the customer experience

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.420
with some product or service

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.800
is very improved, it is as improved

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.660
as to launch an alternative

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.660
proposal.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.660
Another possibility is a sector.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.840
You know a sector, you know an industry,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.300
and what you have identified

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.120
is that there is an opportunity,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.620
an opportunity to compete

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.600
in a slightly different way.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.340
Or, we are able to create

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.240
a blue ocean from the usual

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300
value proposal in that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.740
sector.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
The third one is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.460
you.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480
Sometimes what happens is that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.580
you identify that you have

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.340
strengths, skills,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620
special knowledge or contacts,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.140
whatever, that you can

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.380
turn into a competitive

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.320
advantage.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.240
You build from there.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.320
Regardless of how you came up with

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.620
the idea, we have to ask ourselves

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.420
a question that is vital and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.460
is, and we can’t be fooled

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.640
and it is, this project

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.300
is for us.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.000
And why have we incorporated this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.320
and why will we force you to do so?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.240
Because we see daily that there

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.240
are people, entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.780
who have ideas that can be good

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.680
or not.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.440
We are not going into that now.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.620
The problem is that they don’t fit with them.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.640
We have to find the match.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.700
The match between the idea, the business

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.180
model and the founders.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.320
And what does this depend on?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.560
It depends on many things.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.960
It depends on the implications

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.060
of that business model.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.660
For example, what is needed,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.240
what are the necessary competencies,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.840
as to timing and others.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.340


00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.380
And it depends mostly on you.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.840
It depends on what your

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.720
vital goals are.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.560
It depends on whether you will be able or not.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.160
It depends on what you like to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.560
do, how you want your day to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.700
be.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.800
If everything fits, it’s a good point.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.780
And if it doesn’t fit, the best thing,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.240
no matter how well that idea sounds, is

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.120
to discard it.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.940
Because, and we see it very often,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.440
if what we do is choose projects

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.420
that are not for us,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.320
in the end we are very likely

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.340
to fail.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.020
What’s a drama, but it’s also

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.080
a cost of opportunity because

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.000
if you’ve chosen a project that’

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.340
s not for you, what you’re doing

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.100
is discarding others that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.140
fit you better.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.140
You are missing a lot

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.440
of opportunities.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.900
The next step is to turn that idea

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.180
into a business model.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.900
Do you know about Business Model Canvas?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.780
This is a process

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.560
called Power Canvas.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.660
It’s a lot better for the challenge

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.220
you have now.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.620
The Business Model Canvas is not

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.100
designed to innovate, it is designed

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.760
to analyze and evolve business

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.840
models that already exist.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.360
In Power Canvas we will force

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.380
you to think about really

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.460
important things, to identify what

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.220
the problem that it solves is,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.200
and we will force you to define

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.500
what the characteristics, the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.720
functionalities of your

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.060
value proposal are and how they

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.700
fit in with that problem,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.520
for example.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.620
And it’s also much more practical

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.400
because we’ll work on tools

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.900
that will be useful for you

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.660
later.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.500
The Customer Persona, for example, or

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.620
the script.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.840
You will create a script with

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.020
all the communications you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.400
will use later in sales, marketing,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.480
sales and more.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.180
Or a dashboard, for example.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.040
We will create a Dashboard with the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.380
main metrics, with the important

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.640
ones for you of your business

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.260
model.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.900
We will monitor these metrics and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.540
see if we are on the right track

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.180
or not.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.240
This will help you manage your

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.140
company better.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.660
This phase, however, has to

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.760
be done very quickly.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.400
I know people love to think

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.240
and draw their canvas and so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.140
on, but we can’t spend more than

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.340
a day on this because we’re

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.640
wasting time, because it’

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.440
s worthless.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.820
What you put on paper is not

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.320
worth it.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.460
What we have to do is do it

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.300
very quickly and quickly

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.440
move on to the next steps in

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.080
which we will validate and we will

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.980
learn from customers if

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.880
all that you have put there

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.560
makes sense or doesn’t

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.120
make sense.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.200
And if it doesn’t make sense,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.600
either we discard the idea

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.480
or we evolve that business model.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.900
As I said, the thought

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.760
phase is over.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.640
Now let’s start with the really

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.680
important thing.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.840
We will go out on the street and we will be able to validate.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.500
We will see if we are on the right track

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.080
or not.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.940
We will do it in three stages.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.320
It makes sense

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.100
to do so.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.320
Let’s start by talking to customers.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.800
Then we will do very quick experiments

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.740
and when we have reached

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.280
problem, solution fit, what

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.420
we will do is build the first

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.940
version of your product.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.520
Why do we do it so?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.840
We have explained it other times.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.140
Because what we do is

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.020
minimize the risk.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.440
You can talk to your customers

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.100
today and you will learn a lot.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.720
It is best to do so before taking

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.900
any additional risks.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.280
As we validate and

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.120
learn, we take more

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.160
risk.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.600
But we have already validated the hypotheses,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.920
not before.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.660
As we said, we start

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.060
by talking to customers.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.260
I assure you that you learn

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.500
a lot by doing it.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.880
And people think they did.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.760
He asked four people around there

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.960
in a disorganized way.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.660
They said it was a good idea.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.740
It makes wrong conclusions and at the

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.640
end is harmful.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.560
As I say, you learn a lot,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560
but it’s very difficult to

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.140
do it well.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.620
So we’ll do it with a script.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.920


00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.860
We will do it in a super structured way.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.420
We’ll share with you the templates

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.000
that will help you in those interviews,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120
in those conversations

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.740
with customers.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.960
In some cases, what we will do is,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.260
in interviews, we will support

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.660
ourselves in a demo or a mockup.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.660
What we do so is show potential

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.160
customers what our solution

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.040
is.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.360
Once we get to this point,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.440
we will learn a lot.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.460
You will see how you

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.340
learn a lot from conversations

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.220
with customers.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.280
In most cases, we realize

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.660
that everything was wrong.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.160
But well, it is best to do it

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.120
as soon as possible.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.240
The next step is to do

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.780
experiments.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.780
Experiments are, for example,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.280
a landing page where we bring

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.160
some traffic and measure

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.200
or make ads on some platform

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.840
or create a video.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.060
This, well done, also provides

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.240
us with a lot of information.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.800
What happens is that there are a lot

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.760
of people who don’t.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.340
And I often know that they don’t do it because

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.680
it gives them laziness or because they don’t

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.300
know how to do it.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.260
You may not even know how to

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.200
make a landing page.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.360
It is not an excuse.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.220
Because if you put that excuse and

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.240
what you do is build your

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.940
product, invest time and money

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.580
and then fail, well, because

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.440
you are taking a very high risk.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.360
What we will do is make it

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.180
easy for you.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.100
We’ll share with you very practical

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.680
tips, for example, about how

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.480
to create a landing page or

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.800
how to make ads on platforms.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.040
We’ll help you do some of these

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.480
experiments.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.140
Well, coming to this point, we have

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.420
already talked to customers.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.840
In some cases we have done experiments

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.900
that can provide us with

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.060
a lot of information.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.160
We have to ask ourselves if we

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.360
have reached a problem solution

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.080
fit.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.840
What we do not want is to be

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.740
fooled.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.000
Because the next step is to

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.920
build the first version of your product

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.020
and this implies more risk.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.100
You have to invest a little

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.760
more money.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.520
So we have to be sure.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.300
We’ll force you to ask questions

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.020
so you don’t get fooled.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.800
We have reached problem solution

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.380
fit when we are sure that, because

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.700
we have checked it with customers,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.140
who want to buy us, who see value,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.800
who know how to explain

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.420
the value they see, who understand

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.120
our messages, who are

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.480
willing to pay for it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.980
We have basically validated

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.800
the main hypotheses of your

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.180
business empirically.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.640
And at that point, as we validated

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.000
it and as you have not fooled

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.200
yourself, what we will do is

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.360
start taking more risks.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.420
We will build the least viable

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.100
product.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.780
So we go to the next stage.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.940
We are building the least viable product.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.960
What we will do is learn,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.080
improve our value proposal,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.020
our business model, our minimum

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.020
viable product until

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.400
we reach problem solution

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.280
fit.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.060
Many people understand the concept

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.200
of the minimum viable product, but

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.500
then do not apply it.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.740
So what we’re going to do is

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.380
do it in a very structured way.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.660
Here the key is to identify, but

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.780
what do I include in the minimum

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.480
viable product?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.980
And more importantly, what do I not

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.720
include?

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.060
What do you have to include?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.380
What you have to include

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.000
is, you have to identify what

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.480
the real value you generate,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.460
why they buy you, what are

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.200
the problems you solve and

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.400
what are the features, key

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.540
and basic functionalities.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.760
This, which seems very obvious

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.380
to you, I guarantee you that if

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.680
we pick up a lot of entrepreneurs

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.540
they’t explain it to us.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.900
They don’t really know why they

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.720
buy them, they don’t know what the

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.300
key aspects of their value proposal are.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.400
Well, you’ll identify them and what

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.320
you’ll do is create a product that

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.420
incorporates those key factors

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.560
into your value proposal and

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.980
will be naked of everything

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.420
else.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.740
Do not add anything else, do

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.540
not complicate things.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.780
Whatever you complicate, even

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.480
if you think you don’t, we all

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.960
tend to complicate things.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.580
Making a product that we think

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.480
is better and usually is worse

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.200
and, in addition, everything

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.740
you incorporate takes time,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.080
costs, risks, etc.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.220
So what we’re going to do is identify

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.860
what the key factors are

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.840
and create your minimum viable

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.500
product.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.220
And we will go out to the market and

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.500
we will start validating the entire

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.880
business model and we will do so

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880
by relying on the metrics.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.380
In the key metrics of your business

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.180
model, in that dashboard we will be

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.400
measuring, we will be improving,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.420
we will be measuring, we will

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.440
be improving, we will be learning,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.740
until one day we reach

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.220
Product Market Fit.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.740
When will we know that we have

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.180
reached Product Market Fit?

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.080
By the way, we always say that

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.380
when you reach it, you know it, you

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.360
feel it, it’s like when you’re

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.760
in love, you can’t fool yourself.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.700
Well, we’ll force you again

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.780
to ask questions.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.800
If you have scientifically, empirically

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.620
checked with your customers who buy

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.740
you, who see value, who recommend

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.040
it, if you understand perfectly,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.440
if you know who your customer people

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.300
are and know them perfectly, you

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.900
know the messages that arrive to

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.680
them, those that do not arrive

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.860
to them, you know those that hurt

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.980
them, when you validated that the

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.280
size is large enough, that there

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.180
are enough people who will be

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:47.940
willing to buy, when you

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.520
know what are the channels through

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.840
which you can reach your customers,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.640
when you validated that

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.520
you can grow, that you can scale,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.900
when you know the prices, the

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.180
margins, when you know all

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.740
this, you have reached Product

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.660
Market Fit and at that time

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.180
you will have a very solid

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.380
base.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.920
In fact, everything will be much

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.480
easier.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.960
From here, well, in addition to giving

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.280
you the congratulations, because

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.000
there are few companies that

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.700
get it, you’ll have to worry about

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.560
other things that will come

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.920
after, such as marketing,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.600
such as pushing that business

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.440
model.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.180
Push it because we already know that

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.680
this is the optimal business

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.900
model, because we already know

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.560
that we have a value proposal that

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.060
fits the perception with a

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.460
segment of customers and as

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.620
we are sure of it because we have

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.720
bought it, it makes sense to push

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.440
it, but not before.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.880
Just at this moment you can stop looking

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.320
for yourself, you can put the mode

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.940
of execution.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.280
Here it makes sense to optimize

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.280
the channels, start to reach agreements

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.680
with partners, I don’t know, try

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.000
to win traction and so on,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.500
but only when you’ve reached it.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.700
Why am I going to end this?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.040
Why do I recall this?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.140
Because it is the mistake that

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.440
99.9% of people make that they reach

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.620
new products, services or innovative

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.220
business models and is to put

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.860
the mode of execution from

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.940
the beginning.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.800
And I always compare it with

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.840
whether we cut off the learning of

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.980
a boy or a girl when she is not

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.940
12 or 13.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.880
What happens if you stop and

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.960
stop learning at that moment?

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.040
There will be others who

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.980
will go far beyond

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.440
you.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.320
So let’s end this.
