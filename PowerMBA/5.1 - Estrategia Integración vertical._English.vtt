00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.580
We will look at the vertical integration

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.560
strategy forward, which

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.440
is a strategic move by which,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.400
within the supply chain of your

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.660
industry, you decide to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.920
expand and enter the business

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.260
of your distributors

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.460
or your customers.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.060
And you can do so through organic

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.180
growth, that is, by developing

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.560
it internally, or through inorganic

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.380
growth, which would

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.920
be to buy from a distributor

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.060
company or customer.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.520
Let us see some example.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.900
There is an Apple Store on the screen.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.940
If we think of Apple’s business,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.740
Apple is a producer, it is a

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.320
technology manufacturer.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.060
However, it has decided

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.680
to integrate vertically forward

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.140
with the goal of having more control,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.800
delivering a better customer

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
experience, etc., and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.840
creates the Apple Store.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.520
This goes to the final

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
consumer.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.920
This is a vertical

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.960
integration.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.380
Coca-Cola has chosen a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.980
similar strategy, because

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160
Coca-Cola is also a producer.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.820
What happens is that, within

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.400
its growth strategy, in many

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.860
international markets, what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.400
it has done has been to buy the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.940
bottler, buy companies that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.020
belong to the next link

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.280
within the supply chain,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.340
which are usually called

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.260
wholesale.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.000
Disney, here we have a Disney Store.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.760
Disney is also an audiovisual

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.320
content producer.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.640
Well, because what you decide

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.160
is to integrate vertically

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.200
forward and reach the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.540
end consumer through the Disney

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.960
Store.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.420
Same as Apple.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.740
In the case of Costco, for example,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.580
Costco is a company that is also

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.760
called Costco Wholesale.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.500
Wholesale is the term for wholesale.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.500
So Costco traditionally

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.580
what it was was only

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.740
a wholesaler.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.180
That is, Costco’s customers

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.680
were then small or large

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.280
distributors, etc., right?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.960
Large food distribution, bars,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.780
restaurants...

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.300
Costco decides to integrate

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.240
vertically forward and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.820
reach the final

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.620
consumer.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.040
And currently Costco customers

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.660
are either end consumers

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.040
or retailers, who were their

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.580
traditional customers.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.620
What we will do now is let

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.460
us analyze what are the goals

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.200
or benefits that lead you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.040
to opt for this type of strategy.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.240
We will do so with the Apple

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.800
Store.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.040
Let us start.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.980
Well, the very clear benefit

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.400
that Apple gets with the Apple

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.200
Store is having more control.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.580
You absolutely control how and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.920
where your products are sold.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.300
And, as we said, the customer experience

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.060
in the Apple Store is unique.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.460
This allows Apple to guarantee

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.940
it only by selling

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640
through its own stores.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.720
You think that the rest of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.800
manufacturers do what they do is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.220
sell through stores that belong,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.440
for example, to telephone

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.940
operators or to large warehouses, etc.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.440
And when you sell through your distribution

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.900
channels, it is logical that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.620
you lose some control over

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.540
quality.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.300
Another advantage is that you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.820
are closer to the customer.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.460
Through the Apple Store, Apple

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.740
has a lot of interactions

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.280
with its customers.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.880
It allows you to know the customer

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.000
much more than if you sold

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.380
only through a distribution channel.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.160
Another obvious benefit, in addition

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.480
to being always given in the vertical

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.900
integration strategy, whether forward

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.640
or backwards, is that of course,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.100
you capture your margins.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.580
Thro the supply chain,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.040
every step applies

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.140
a margin.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
So, if you enter the business

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.000
of your customers or your

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.800
distributors, you’ll get

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.740
that margin.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.060
You will catch it, you will make it yours.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.540
You can use it to make more

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.820
money or you can use it to

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.680
lower prices.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.680
In the case of Apple, which is what

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.200
we are doing, it does not lower

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.620
prices.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.800
That is, the final price for the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.120
customer is the same, either through

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.340
an Apple Store or through a distribution

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.980
channel that is not owned

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.780
by Apple.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.320
What happens is that in the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.420
Apple Store, when Apple sells

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.820
an iPhone in a form, through

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.900
direct sale or through the Apple

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.100
Store, the margin is obviously

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.180
much higher.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.900
But the most important benefits

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.740
are generating a competitive

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.040
advantage and an entry barrier.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.600


00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.400
You think that, as we said, the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.480
customer experience at Apple’s point

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.800
of sale, in the Apple Store

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.280
is unique, it’s a real success

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280
case in this.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.660
This gives you a competitive

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.220
advantage over other technology

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.400
manufacturers that do not have

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.520
their own sales points.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.840
There is also a major barrier to entry.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.660
Because if you want to compete with

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.920
a company that is vertically

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.660
integrated, either forward

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.220
or backwards, that control

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.560
that has the entire supply chain

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.700
is very difficult to imitate.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.080
Thus, they are creating significant

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.280
entry barriers for potential

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.160
competitors.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.420
Think of it, it is obvious.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.680
It is much harder to compete

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.660
with Apple.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.880
Let us not think now about the brand,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.740
etc., but simply because it is, in

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.080
addition to a manufacturer

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.300
or a retailer, that with a company

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.980
that is only a manufacturer.
