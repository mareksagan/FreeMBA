00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.640
Today we will study one of the

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.940
most well-known tools or

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.180
models of strategic analysis,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.340
which is the 5 forces of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.800
Porter.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.160
This model is studied by

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.460
everyone in the career, in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.700
any career related to

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.380
business administration

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.500
or in any graduate program

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
also as an MBA, any business

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.480
related program.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.920
And it's a tool that is born of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.180
Michael Porter, who is one of the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.840
gurus, if not the biggest guru

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.360
of strategy and marketing worldwide.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900
He is the father of many of the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.260
concepts and theories we study,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.600
of literature in general, of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.720
management and that we will

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.000
study in particular in The

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.700
Power MBA.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.460
The first thing I want you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.860
to know is why are the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.100
5 forces of Porter?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.540
It is designed to help us

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.260
assess the profitability

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.300
of a business.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.500
The profitability of a sector

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
is sustainable, right?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.040
But no, I think I would say more, not

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.640
only that, but that in addition the 5

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.080
forces of Porter, now you will understand

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.100
it, helps you understand the dynamics

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.780
of a sector, helps you to have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.520
a photo with greater height, right?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.040
The different factors affecting

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.080
a sector.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.960
The term “force” is used very

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.460
well in this case, right?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.840
There are five forces.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.340
The power that the comparers

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.760
have over you.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.860
The threat or risk that there

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.720
is a substitute product.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.000
The threat of entering new competitors,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.040
which is very much

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.520
related to entry barriers.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.160
The power your suppliers

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.140
have over you.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.580
And these four forces ultimately

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.460
do what they do is influence

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.120
the degree of competitive rivalry

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.200
that we begin with replacement

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.220
products.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.960
Replacement products

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.600
are products that you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.860
may not currently compete

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.580
with, but that meet

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.220
the same needs.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.480
I will give you a very clear

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.580
example, beer and wine.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.100
Beer and wine are

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.260
often substitutes.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.580
This makes the profitability

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.880
within the beer and wine sector

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.920
look somewhat compromised.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.640
And in fact, if beer has gained

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.040
market share in the last 30 years,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.760
replacing wine, a very good substitute

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400
product, especially in certain

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.060
uses of wine, it is very

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.800
clear that if there are

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.900
products in your sector or outside

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
your sector there are products

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.900
that can replace the value of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.680
the products or services

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.760
that your sector is offering,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.660
profitability can be

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.660
compromised.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.840
It is a very strong force that must

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.060
be valued.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.220
We are going to face the threat of new competitors.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.800
This factor is one of the most

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.140
important and it is also that we

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.300
will devote an entire class because

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.920
it is related to the entrance

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.500
barriers.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.920
If entry barriers are

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.600
high, the threat of new

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.000
competitors is lower.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.620
I will give you an example because

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.140
we will look at it in more detail.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.580
For example, if you need a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.260
huge investment to enter

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.500
your industry, the barriers

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.980
to entry are higher.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.060
Or if your industry, for example, is regulated.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.740
Imagine, we are talking about a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.200
restaurant that has a license.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.500
The barrier to entry is even

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.840
greater if you need licenses

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.880
to compete.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.300
The pharmacies in Spain are

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.380
doing the same.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.740
They are regulated by these licenses.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.860
This makes your sector more profitable

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.380
because it is protected.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.240
There is less threat from new competitors.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.720
Or if there are patents

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.520
or technologies or some type

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.400
of protection that protects you from

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.300
new competitors.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.600
Sometimes the entry barriers,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.860
for example, are given by access

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.540
to distribution channels.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.760
This is changing, and I'

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.520
ll give you the opposite example.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.800
Today, Amazon, for example, this

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.100
type of marketplace, that of

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.840
platforms or e-commerce, are

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.700
becoming the main distribution

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.760
channels of very many

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.080
brands, of very many manufacturers

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.840
and the access to therefore,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.740
Amazon is decreasing the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.260
barriers of entry

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.220
in many sectors.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.240
Because you can get into competing

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.860
with current manufacturers

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.200
selling through Amazon.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.100
Without having to depend, imagine

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.280
getting into agreement with a lot of distributors.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.340
Well, I think the concept is very

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.180
easy to understand.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, let's go to the power of the suppliers.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.920
This force determines what is if

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.620
suppliers have a lot of power

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.300
over you, your profitability

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.420
will be seen and we'll see it

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.600
with two examples that are opposite.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.460
We'll go to a Orange store.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.960
I'm talking about the business of

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.000
the distributor, the small

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.660
businessman who has a store in Orange.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.800
One store or five?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.320
It does not matter.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.660
In this case, who is your provider?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.820
Their provider is Orange, with whom

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.560
they have an agreement, a true alliance.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.860
Well, in this case it is very clear

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.140
that the provider is much more

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.540
you do not need because you can

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.980
study for many other distributors

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.220
that it has.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.240
It is clear that if we analyze this

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.520
sector and cover up the business

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.700
model of an Orange distributor,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.360
this is a clear weakness.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.640
It is a force that restores

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.480
profitability, because the reality

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.340
is that operators, in this case

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.920
like Orange, but I'm not talking

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920
about an object of Orange, but in

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.820
general, with their distribution

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.920
channel have a lot of power over

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.220
their distribution channel.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.260
You can change the conditions, etc.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.720
What it does, obviously, is

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.100
to decrease the profitability, which,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.420
as you know, is the goal

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.280
of this tool.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.260
But now we go to the opposite,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.060
right?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.540
We will think of a large

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.720
food distributor, such as Mercadona,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.480
for example, or Correfour,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.580
whoever is worth us.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.740
In this case, your suppliers,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.000
well, by the way, I'm sharing

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.540
the supply chain that

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.280
helps a lot to understand

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.440
this kind of thing in a sector,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.960
right?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.240
Well, in this case, if

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.780
providers are larger or smaller

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.020
than you, then in principle

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.280
they are smaller than you.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.040
You have a lot of power

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
over your customers.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.860
In this case, the force, this

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.920
force, what it does is favor

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.300
you.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.580
And you have heard, we have

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.140
analyzed it, really the profitability

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.440
of Mercadona is being boosted

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.240
because it can have a lot

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.580
of power over suppliers, tighten

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.900
suppliers, as all the

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.580
large distributors

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.500
do, right?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.080
Now let's go to the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.160
other case, let's analyze

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.700
the power that buyers have

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700
over us.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.180
If the buyers have a lot of power

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.360
over us, if they are bigger,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.840
more potent, etc., then we will

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.040
have a profitability problem

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.480
sooner or later, always,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.260
right?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.500
Let us think of a raw material

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.580
producer, for example,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.200
a farmer, and this farmer

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.820
turns out to be a supplier

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.920
of a large food distribution

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.940
chain such as Mercadona.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.280
Let us put the same case.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.040
What is much more powerful than

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.180
you is much bigger than you.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.200
You can tighten, you can change for

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.840
another, etc., profitabilities go

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.860
down, of course.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.900
There is a very interesting concept

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.800
here that we have already seen in

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.300
the course of business model analysis

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.460
that is exchange costs.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.380
If you remember, the exchange

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.060
costs are the ease, the degree

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.600
of ease with which you, your

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.660
buyers change, change

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.260
producers, change suppliers,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.720
right?

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.220
You are a software manufacturer,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.200
I put SAP, but any one is worth

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.040
us and your customers have

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.120
high exchange costs.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.720
It's very difficult to change software

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.940
and that benefits you.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.220
That benefits SAP and software

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.000
manufacturers a lot, right?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.440
It is very difficult to change.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.660
We have already seen it at the time,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.660
but it is that there are companies

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.180
or sectors whose exchange costs

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.300
are very low and here I share on

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.400
screen a comparison of insurance, right?

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.100
The car insurance can be changed

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.380
in one day.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.620
It is very easy to change car insurance,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.440
so for insurance companies

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.040
this is a problem because the cost

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.140
of changing their customers is very

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.900
low and that does, we will see

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.520
it later, like all the forces,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.380
that in the end the competitive

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.000
war is greater.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.240
Another factor that determines the

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.080
degree of power that buyers have

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.300
over you is that your proposal

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.700
is the same as that of others,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.600
that that of others is the sector.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.400
If it is a very commoditized sector

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.820
in which everyone offers the same thing

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.120
and it is only a price issue, because

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.220
the power it has bought on you is

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.420
enormous because it changes you, it

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.240
changes you the next day for

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.420
another because it gives you the

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.760
same as another, because it is that

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.340
you offer the same thing, right?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.360
Well, in the end, these four

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.060
forces that we have analyzed,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.320
the power of buyers, the

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.560
power of substitutes, the

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.760
threats of entry, of the possible

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.140
entrances of new competitors,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.280
that is, the barriers of entry,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080
the power that suppliers have,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.820
all this, these four what they

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.680
do is influence much or determine

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.140
the rivalry, the degree of

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.080
competitive rivalry that

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.560
there is within a sector,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.540
right?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.480
It is the consequence.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.000
We usually say that almost

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.080
all sectors are red oceans.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.120
This is a term that we will use

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.380
a lot when we analyze the

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.400
blue ocean strategy.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.940
What is happening in the Red Ocean?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.960
Well, what happens is that when there

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.560
is a lot of competitive war,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.440
because there are price wars, you

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.140
have to invest permanently

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.940
to differentiate because if you are

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.820
not competitive and that permanent

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.440
investment, what it does is lower

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.980
your profitabilities, is it worth it?

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.640
More competitive rivalry is always

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.840
the same, always with lower profitabilities.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.410
Well, we'll see a case in which

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.830
red ocean, but well, we could

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.450
put a lot and we'll think about

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.810
commercial banking.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.470
What is happening in the commercial banking?

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.790
Well, there are a lot of competitors

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.630
or almost all are similar

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.530
or very similar, right?

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.050
They offer the same.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.130
The proposal is very similar, very comfortably.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.450
This is what it does, what happens

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.790
with this is that obviously the profitabilities

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.450
go down because, as we have said,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.570
customers give them the same

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.810
to work with one bank than with

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.810
another, etc.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.150
And there is also another concept

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.850
I want to add today that I want you to know.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.690
This is the concept of exit barriers.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.170
I will give you an example.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.910
If competitors within a sector,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.530
all have made strong investments

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.990
to be in that sector and out

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.990
of that sector, would involve

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.530
huge drag costs or, for

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.210
example, being in that

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.770
sector is absolutely

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.770
strategic.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.510
They cannot go out.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.250
Whatever the situation, they cannot go out.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.270
This is what we call exit barriers.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:50.810


00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.030
What happens when there

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.810
are barriers?

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.150
If you are trapped, if you are

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.310
forced to compete within

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.810
a sector, whatever happens,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.930
you won't get out.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.210
You are encouraged to make the

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.070
competitive struggle much bigger

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.230
and this makes the profitability

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.170
bigger.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.030
If we put a group of companies into

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.570
competition and we will make the

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.810
sign that we have put a fence out

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.310
and they can't get out, they have no

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.070
other option than to fight for that

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:19.750
market share.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.950
If, however, the output barriers

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.550
are smaller and competitors

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.070
can get out, because as soon as the

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.410
profitability is not very high,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.310
they will get out and those who

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.090
stay inside will be

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.190
benefited by it.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.050
Well, we have already seen the five

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.930
forces of Porter, we have analyzed one

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.730
by one and as we have seen determines

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.090
the profitability of a sector.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.630
How is this tool used?

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.230
In each case of analysis,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.710
some forces will have some

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.550
application and others will not.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.350
It is important to identify

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.910
which sectors are affected.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.390


00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.490
And really you can do an analysis

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.950
at this level, there is no need

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.830
to go into much more level.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.190
As I have said many times, analysis,

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.470
let's say, in which you don't lose

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.570
the details, are those that allow

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.630
you to quickly identify,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.790
get more valuable conclusions.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.130
