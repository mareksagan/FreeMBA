00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.520
Another approach you should incorporate

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.460
into your thinking and strategic

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.300
analysis when we analyze

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.440
a sector is differentiation.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.440
Differentiation is the degree of

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.270
differentiation between the offers,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.750
between the value proposals of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.230
the competitors that are within.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.990
I think it should be looked at

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.170
from the client's perspective.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.290
That is, customers perceive

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.490
that all companies offer the same.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.750
There are sectors in which it is so, and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.970
there are sectors in which customers

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.630
perceive that there is a lot of

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.370
difference between the different proposals.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.430
And this has many implications

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.230
in things we'll see like profitability,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.090
entry barriers, the degree

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.770
of competition, how prices

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.210
are fixed, etc.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.270
We'll see later, right?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.430
What I want you to understand now

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.170
is what differentiation is and which

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.330
sectors are more differentiated

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.410
than others.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.050
Differentiation is not, as I say,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.190
I have said other times, it is not

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.430
white or black, but it is a degree,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190
it is a scale.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.190
We have sectors that are or

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.290
industries or markets that are

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.650
very very little differentiated,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.910
which are in an extreme the sectors

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.210
that we call commoditized, commodities.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.390
In the client he perceives that all

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.310
proposals are equal and sometimes

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.170
it is that they are actually equal.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850
Think of the raw materials,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.230
wood or wheat sectors.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.930
All of the options are the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.490
same, the only issue is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.550
the price.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.950
The customer is not interested in buying one or

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.550
the other.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.570
Industrial sectors are often

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.610
highly commoditized, for example.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.510
The proposals are very similar among

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.710
the different companies and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.410
the degree of differentiation

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.810
is growing.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.110
For example, I'll give you the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.290
wine industry.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.470
The wine sector may depend on the

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.830
segments, but in the more economic

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.330
segments the degree of differentiation

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.530
is very low.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.510
The customer is not usually

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.910
bound by any of the brands.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.050
It is almost the same to buy

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.170
one brand than another.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.590
Or the banks, for example.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.690
The proposals of the banks are

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.930
very similar.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.210
The client decides almost by

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.650
proximity, by the office that he has

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.730
nearby, because he knows the proposal

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.230
of five banks, you will realize

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.910
that they are very similar.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.530
They try to differentiate, everyone

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.950
tries to differentiate, but in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.490
some sectors it is more complicated

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.850
than in others.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.770
We can also think of sectors where

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.470
they are very different.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.370
Imagine the luxury industry

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.210
in general.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.450
We have premium, luxury

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.590
watches here.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.510
If you ask the customer if it is the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.370
same for a customer who spends 10,000

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.390
or 15,000 euros on a watch, if it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.930
is the same for him to buy a Rolex

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.530
than a Hublot, he will tell you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.070
no.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.950
It will tell you thousands of differences

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.550
and from your perception the proposals

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.250
are very different.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.570
For example, I would like to refer

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.430
to the lawyers' offices.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.410
It is true that the lawyers'

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.550
offices, the proposals themselves,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.470
the proposed services can be very

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.570
similar, but the differentiation

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.210
occurs by people.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.050
That is, because a very strong

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.630
link is generated between the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.870
lawyer and the client and that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.490
makes clients perceive differentiation.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.350
In this case, the differentiation

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.310
is made to the person providing the service.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.270
For example, I'll give you a case.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.650
Sometimes within the same industry

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.370
there are segments that are more

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.170
differentiated and others are less

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.650
differentiated.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.050
For example, in the automotive industry.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.430
If we go to the sector of more economical

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.950
cars, normal cars, because the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.930
differentiation is less.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.810
The client is more likely to choose between

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.650
one or the other.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.170
They often look at the price.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.270
It is usually a price decision.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.030
If we go to the extreme of ultra-

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.590
luxury cars, the differentiation

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.770
is maximum.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.230
The perception of the customer

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.690
of buying a Rolls, of buying a

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.190
Ferrari, is huge.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.170
You don't usually decide on the price.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.110
They value other things.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.250
Well, I hope you already understand

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.970
well and that you will assimilate what

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.630
is the difference between more differentiated

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.690
and less differentiated sectors.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.370
But what really matters about

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.530
this class, besides that, is that

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.850
you understand that you know

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.470
what the implications it has

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.950
on prices, in marketing, in

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.690
competition, etc.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.250
The fact that a sector is more or

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.590
less differentiated.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.390
This is important and you have to go assimilating

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.230
it, right?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.750
Although this is all common sense,

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.010
let's see point by point.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.870
Let's start with the price and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.370
the price sensitivity.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.550
In the sectors that are very little

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.770
differentiated, in the sectors

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.410
that are commoditized, the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.190
price sensitivity is maximum.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.290
That is, the customer decides only

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.910
by price, because all proposals

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.290
are the same.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.930
Therefore, companies that

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.050
are competing have very little

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.410
freedom to set prices or no.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.970
When the market gives it, demand

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.630
gives it.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.190
If you put the price a little more

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.510
expensive, that the others will not

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.290
sell anything, the price is

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.110
determined by demand.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.170
And if you lower the prices a little,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.990
you will sell a lot, you will sell more

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.070
than your competitors.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.550
It is given by demand.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.190
You think, let's go to the case

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.110
of super-differentiated sectors,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.270
as we have seen luxury cars.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.490
Well, since price fixation,

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.890
here there is a lot more

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.130
freedom to set the price

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.770
by the company.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.270
It is easy to understand.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.310
Now, let's go to the next point, marketing.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.990
Do you think that in a commoditized

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.310
sector, such as the wood industry,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.030
marketing is very important?

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.530
It is very little important.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.050
The price is the important thing.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.970
In contrast, in sectors with greater

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.590
degree of differentiation, without going

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.130
to the extreme of luxury cars, we

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.810
stay in the average, we stay

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.530
in the wine that we have more degree

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.570
of differentiation.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.950
How do you sell the product?

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.930
gain of weight.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.290
And the competition?

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.010
How is the competition?

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.950
Where is the fiercest competition?

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.510
In a market where everyone offers

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.310
the same or in a market where companies

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.190
are able to differentiate their

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.510
product and connect with

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.450
their customers?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.070
Well, because competition, competitive

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.750
struggle is greater in sectors

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.910
where everyone offers the

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.010
same.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.910
They are all competing

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.990
for the same cake, the same

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.370
customers, and the same

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.090
weapons.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.710
This is what we call a red ocean.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.910
In contrast, in highly differentiated

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.950
sectors, companies eventually

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.010
manage to have their loyal customers.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.270
Within those loyal customers

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.330
they no longer have to compete

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.550
with others, etc.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.130
I think it is easy to understand.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.830
Another important point are the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.010
economies of scale, which we will see

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.330
in another class.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.390
To compete in a commoditized market,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.190
such as the wood or raw materials

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.410
market, for example, it

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.730
is important to benefit

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.850
from economies of scale,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.390
because the economy of

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.450
scale allows you to lower

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.070
prices.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.010
And as we compete in price, this type

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.330
of market requires you to be very

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.050
large, to be very cost efficient and

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.650
to be able to impact those costs

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.830
on your customers.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.360
In contrast, in more differentiated

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.570
markets, it can be small,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.330
maybe not so cost efficient

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.210
and go up a little and impact

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.350
the price, because the customer

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.070
is willing to pay maybe a little

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.010
more if you offer something

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.490
different to others and convince

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.870
that customer.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.470
The Margins.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.890
Margin is much lower when the

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.030
sector is more comfortably developed.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.910
Why is?

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.150
Because the customer is not

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.230
willing, as he said before,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.070
to pay a dollar more.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.510
He is not willing to pay more

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.510
because he realizes that everyone

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.950
is equal.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.810
If I get two companies and they

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.750
offer me the same, who will I hire?

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.530
I will hire the cheapest one.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.650
Instead, if I have to choose between

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.930
a smartphone with one operating system

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.750
or another and I like this operating

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.930
system more than the other, because

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.370
I will be willing to pay a little

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.250
more, because I perceive some

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.370
value, I perceive some differentiation

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.330
and that in what it impacts

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.510
is on the margin of the companies.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.150


00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.150
And finally, the relationship with customers.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.290
How is the relationship with

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.130
customers in an absolutely

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.770
comforted sector?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.770
The customer is not faithful.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.430
The customer does not care.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.730
It is not the same for the customer to have

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.330
one supplier of raw materials than another.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.070
Why do they offer the same?

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.150
In contrast, in sectors with much

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.910
differentiation, either by the

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.490
product, service, or by the people

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.350
who are inside, well, because more

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.950
faithful relationships are

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.450
generated, because the customer

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.490
values that.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.050
He appreciates it and, as we have seen

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.590
before, is willing to pay for it.
