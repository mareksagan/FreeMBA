00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.460
Let's talk about one of the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.520
most important conversion tools

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.440
there, which I have also mentioned

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.460
on several occasions, and is

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.520
Retardieting.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.700
Although, by the way, sometimes you hear

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.640
the concept of Remarketing, but it

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.320
doesn't matter, that is, it's the same.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.840
Remarketing is used

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.720
on certain platforms.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.240
The first thing I will do

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.540
is explain what this retardation

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.460
is about.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.080
In general, what allows us is

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.040
to re-impact, and we can

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.180
re-impact in different

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.580
ways, people who have done,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.680
who have had an interaction

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.640
with us.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.720
First we interact and then we

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.960
impact it again.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720
What are the interactions or

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.900
what are the criteria?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.660
The main thing is that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.640
you have always visited

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.560
our website.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.240
And then it leaves a trace that is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.800
a cookie that allows us to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.700
track that.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.220
But it may be that you have clicked

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.920
on an ad on a social network, or on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.780
another platform, or that you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.080
have opened an email, or that you

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.900
have seen a video, or that within our

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.640
website you have entered in particular

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.380
one of the parts of the website.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.860
These are all the criteria.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.420
Well, this person does what it does,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.740
it has that interaction with us

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.780
and we do what we do, we will

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.080
impact it again.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.780
How will we impact him again?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.920
For example, we can impact you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.700
with an advertisement on display

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.620
in a medium.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.860
This is typical.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.180
I am sure you have all lived it.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.700
I today entered the world, by the way,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
fix you, what title and history,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.820
and it turns out that I get an

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.460
advertisement from InstaPage that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.680
is a tool that we use in The Power

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.300
MBA.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.520
It is clearly retargeting.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.780
I at some point entered the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.340
InstaPage page, on the landing

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.200
page, a cookie is left in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.100
browser and they can track that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.720
and they impact me again.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.060
Or, for example, what sometimes

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.460
happens is that when you enter

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.420
an e-commerce, then you are shown

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.400
not only advertising of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.620
that e-commerce, but also

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.860
the products related to what you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.580
have sought.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.780
This is an example I have taken

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.540
from the internet.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.260
Or where you can also do very

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.580
common retargeting on social

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.460
media.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.360
I went on Facebook, today I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.860
picked up this screenshot and what

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.540
I saw is two ads that are

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.640
clearly retargeting.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.920
MicroStrategy, which is a software, and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.400
MentorBox.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.300
In both cases I have visited

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.080
the websites.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.600
It is retargeting.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.300
Or, for example, today I

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600
received an email from Amazon

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.820
that is in which I suggest books

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.140
on business-related topics,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.860
related to searches

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.360
I have done previously.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.860
In this case, Amazon does what it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.780
does is use the email as a channel

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.880
to re-impact me, but the concept

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.920
is the same.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.640
An action with a company, a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.760
website or whatever, and what

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.720
they do is to impact you again.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.420
We all have experienced this, so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.360
it is very easy to understand the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.680
concept.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.410
What I want now is to analyze

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.970
why retargeting is a tool

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.950
that we always recommend

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.630
to all companies that use digital

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.630
channels that value it and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.390
put it into practice.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.670
I would say that the reason is mostly

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.850
the following.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.850
The reason is that retargeting allows

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.010
us to accompany the customer throughout

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.390
the entire funnel, to accompany

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.950
him in decision-making.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.250
What do I mean with this?

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.230
Well, you can re-impact people

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.530
who have clicked on an ad What

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.430
you want is that they are

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.910
lead, but they are not.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.890
But they have clicked on the ad, which

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.190
shows that they have some interest

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.830
or have visited your landing page.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.930
What we do is impact

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.050
them.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.170
It's like we're doing an ultra-segmented

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.450
campaign on people who have

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.110
interest.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.690
Or for example, we want to impact

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.090
the leads that haven't bought

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.170
us again, down the funnel.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.530
Because we use retargeting, it's another

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.650
ultra-segmented campaign.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.670
All this allows us to increase

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.170
the ROI of all our actions

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.410
or campaigns, because we

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.670
are accompanying

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.230
the customer.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.250
That's why I told you when we analyzed

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.130
the channels or outbound capture

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.350
platforms, what I told you is

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.350
that one of the 10 criteria

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.450
is this, it's the fact of being

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.430
able to do retargeting.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.590
Because you, and I put you to the extreme,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.950
if you make an advertisement on television,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.710
you impact it, it may be that you generate traffic,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.970
you generate awareness, you generate

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.990
brand, but it does not allow you to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.810
go along with it.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.210
The TV doesn't allow you to keep

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.890
going with that client.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.270
And there are other platforms that do.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.050
So, to finish, how is this

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.690
being done?

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670
How do we do retargeting campaigns?

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.750
Well, we do it the same way we

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.790
do when dealing with campaigns

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.730
on the platforms we use for outbound

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.730
marketing.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.750
Likewise, on the same platforms

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.130
you can basically do it on, you

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.550
can do it almost all, you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.550
can do it on Facebook, you

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.630
can do it on Google, you can

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.790
do it on LinkedIn, etc.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.950
You're really hiring campaigns,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.670
launching campaigns, but that

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.450
in segmentation what you

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.790
do is a retargeting segmentation.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.010
You are impacting people again,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.870
having defined that criterion

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.250
that we said before.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.630
The criterion that it is, the one

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.570
you prefer, the one you consider

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.670
to be representative of having

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.490
a certain interest and the people

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.070
you want to impact again.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.370
I will give you examples.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.070
For example, we do remarketing

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.130
campaigns with videos to people

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.670
who have visited a certain

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.870
part of our website.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.630


00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.210
Then, when they enter YouTube,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.830
they get videos with testimonials

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.730
from our students.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.530
We use the video in this case.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.790
We do the same on Facebook, for

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.490
example.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.390
We do various types of Facebook

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.450
campaigns with the concept of

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.370
retargeting.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.570
People who have visited us or are

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.530
already a lead.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.010
And, in addition, we define concrete

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.390
messages for each of those stages,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.090
because the lead or visit at each

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.610
moment, the time of maturing

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.090
you have is different.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.730
There are people who know you more and there

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.610
are people who know you less.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.150
So, in campaigns you have

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.130
to not just define

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.290
videos, texts, etc.
