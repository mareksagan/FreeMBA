00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.230
Let us look at it now with an example.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.510
Let's compare two projects.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.670
Two projects with different risks.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.090
Let us think.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.390
We have to value, or they give us

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.430
the opportunity to value and

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.630
acquire two companies.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.490
We have to pay for that company.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.470
We have to buy the company and we

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.890
will receive some cash flows

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.490
in the future, obviously.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.740
In both cases, when

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.180
the seller projected cash

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.820
flows of $100,000 per year.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.720
for three years.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.140
It is very simple, we have simplified

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.160
everything.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.620
These are the box flow.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.460
of the two companies.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.680
We will receive the same

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.960
for both companies.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.040
But the first company

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.860
we have at the top is

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.120
a real estate, real estate

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.280
company.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.740
It sometimes seems like a

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.860
hassle to use the terms in English,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.580
but really real estate is a

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.740
term we have to know because

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380
it is used frequently.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.040
What is happening in the real estate sector?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.180
What happens to this company?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.720
It is a company that will be devoted

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.860
or that is devoted, for example,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.320
to buy assets in prime areas of large

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.000
cities and put them in profitability.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.140
This is a business with a very low

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.900
risk.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.100
But we have the case B, which is a technological

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.820
startup.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.540
It turns out that your cousin offers

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.560
you to invest in an app with which

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960
you want to change the world, etc.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.940
The risk is very high in this case.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.440
As we can see on the screen,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.540
we have two box streams.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.000


00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.020
And now what we have to do is determine

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.520
what the net current value is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.360
or what the value of those two

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.160
companies is.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600
How much would we be willing

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.360
to invest in each of these

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.460
projects?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.840
So first, I would like you to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.080
do the analysis.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.220
Which would you be willing to invest

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.080
more in?

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.960
Two companies that offer you the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.660
same, in theory, what they offer

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.440
you is the same cash flows to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.940
futures that are but not.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.440
However, one of the two has a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.140
higher risk.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200
Which would you pay more for?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.960
Well, let's see it.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.460
And we'll go back to the formula

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.440
we've seen before, which is that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.820
the upgrade rate depends on the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.020
risk-free interest plus the risk bonus.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.040
The risk-free interest in both cases

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.900
is the same.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
Let's say it's 2%.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280
We will now put it on the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.720
risk premium to each of the investments.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.600
For example, we allocate 3%

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.020
to real estate investments.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.000
We demand an additional 3% of the price.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080
Well, we're going to get a 3% more

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
than in treasure letters, for

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.920
example, and we're happy with that.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280
Instead of the startup, how much

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.860
will we demand?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.720
We will demand a lot more because

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.460
the probability, by pure statistics,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.300
that a company of that type

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.020
does not work and that those $100,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.820
000 of which we have talked

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.240
all the years do not end up

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.180
materializing are very high.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.880
Therefore, we must charge you

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.520
or assign you a higher risk

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.880
premium.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.720
Well, what we do is go to the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.020
formula again of cash flow discount

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.280
and we'll calculate the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.880
value for each of the two

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.340
investments.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.700
In case A, real estate, the factor,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.420
the discount rate is 5% and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.920
in the case of the startup

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.140
is 50%.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.260
From that, we calculate

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.560
the current value.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.200
In which of the two cases is the current

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.920
value higher?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.980
What did I ask you before?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.040
Well, since it is obvious that the current

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.360
value is higher given that the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.680
cash flows are the same, the current

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.320
value is higher in the case of the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.880
investment that has lower risk,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.380
which is 272,000 euros.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.460
You buy the company or invest 272,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.660
000 euros and by demanding a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.240
profitability of 5% every year you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.800
will get 100,000 euros the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.960
next three years.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.500
This is the explanation.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.900
However, if we go to the second

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.260
case, the current net value is 140,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.740
000 euros.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.480
I would not invest more than 140,000

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.520
euros in this project.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.120
Why is?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.220
Because the risk is very high, because

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.060
you have to demand a high profitability

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.560
given, as we have said,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.860
that the risk is very high.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.220
In this case, the update

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.900
rate is 50%.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.770
Well, as we've seen, if the discount

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.510
rate is higher, the current

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.750
value is lower.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.030
The value of the company, the value

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.910
of the investment, what we would be willing

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.770
to pay is less, it is obvious,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.910
because there is more risk.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.270
But let's see it now from another

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.610
perspective that I think can

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.770
help us understand it even

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.570
better.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.230
We'll think of the same two cases,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.030
real estate and startup.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.310
And we will think that in both

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.990
cases the current value of that

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.750
investment or what we have to

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.730
invest is 100,000 euros.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.990
We have to invest 100,000 euros in

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.250
the real estate sector and

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.470
100,000 euros in a startup.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.470
And what we are going to do now is, we

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.230
have already calculated, we already

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.550
know what the profitability we will

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.890
demand from those investments.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.710
In which of the two cases do

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.390
you think cash flows should be

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.570
higher, so that this is

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.390
attractive?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.720
Well, because it is obvious that cash

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.480
flows should be higher in the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.140
investment with more risk.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.260
If I invest 100,000 euros in real

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.860
estate and 100,000 euros in a startup,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.320
I obviously hope that the cash flows

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.420
that the startup generates

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.760
will be much greater.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.080
Why is?

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.400
The risk of getting them is much

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.100
greater.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.100
We can see this in the formula.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.640
Because in the discount of cash

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.980
flows, the variables are the net

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.480
current value or the company'

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.020
s value or the present value,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.740
the cash flows that will be

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.880
generated or that will be higher.
