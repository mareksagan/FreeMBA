WEBVTT

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.400
And finally, I would love to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.660
tell us some examples of companies

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.860
we all know, how they have applied

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.640
the CRM strategy and what

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.300
they have achieved.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.300
Well, I would like to name several

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.060
examples.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.560
The first of course I would like

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.920
to be Philips and we have two

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.200
big business groups.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.320
It is the whole part of consumption

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.520
and we can take the example

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.980
of toothbrushes.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.460
A simple toothbrush, well, maybe

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.040
you can register it, that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.480
is true that it gives some information,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.920
but now what we are doing is,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.560
we have created one one app

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.300
that has connected the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.540
toothbrush, that is, that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.840
is, that is a smart toothbrush

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.780
that will give you information

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.980
based on the use

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.780
you do.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.760
That's connected to our CRM

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.780
system and what we can do is

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.720
launch certain campaigns or launch

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.420
certain actions based on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.920
all of that data we're collecting.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.140
And what did it serve you?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.960
What we have achieved is to know the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.660
customer much better, know exactly

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.760
how they use our services, how they

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.600
use our products and how they

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.500
want to integrate this entire

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.640
ecosystem into their lives.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.420
And what specific information, so that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.880
we can understand it better, what

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.540
specific information are you collecting?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.800
How often do you use this product?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.420
How much do brushes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.380
change?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.180
Where did you buy this product?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.600
If you have been through whether you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
have any other product from us,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.360
what is the frequency of changing

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.940
accessories or products?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.080
Okay, well, we are already getting the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.560
idea.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
Of course, you make information that

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.100
you are collecting through an

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.100
app, well, through the device itself.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.360
That is, the device and the app, that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.680
is one of the examples.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.280
But do people not have to put information

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.420
every time they brush their

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.000
teeth?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.440
No, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.440
That is, say, it is connected to the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.980
app directly.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.980
There are cases, for example, we

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.240
have all entered a property

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.520
in the city of L'HÃ´tel de la Ville,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.460
that the first thing they ask

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.160
you is, many times, or your name

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.880
or code, at the time they locate

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.140
you, they know what you bought, what

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.500
you like and they make

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.840
recommendations based on that.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.880
They know that you like that type

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.160
of coffee you bought two weeks

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.100
ago, so they know that you took two

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.480
boxes and consumed them in two weeks,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.760
because you can be an habitual

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340
coffee consumer and according

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.060
to that they make recommendations

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.000
for you.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.440
This is another example that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.140
I think is relevant.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.780
Another example is American

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.680
Express.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.960
American Express has been in use

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.300
for many years and was one of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.100
the first to introduce the system

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.200
by customer gratification points

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.920
and has very well segmented

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.300
its customers according to how

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.020
much they spend and how much money

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.080
they make with them and therefore

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.340
also the type of cards there,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.620
the GOL, the Belt, all these

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.380
things.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.480
They know their products very well,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.620
they know their customers very

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.080
well and know when they have to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.500
communicate with them, either from

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.800
marketing, from sales or from

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.140
customer service to sell you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.220
an additional insurance or an

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.480
extension of the card.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760
I come to think, for example,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.540
that now in the marketplaces or

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.260
e-commerce this is leading to an

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.060
extreme, well I say, that is, that

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.800
CRM strategy, as they have so

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.400
much information or you get

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.120
into Amazon and recommend books

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.480
that have to do with what you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.340
have bought, in many cases

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.440
that provides you with value

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.360
because it makes suggestions.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.860
justly.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.660
There is another component that you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.920
have and you don't have to see that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.760
they are DMPs, that what they do

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.740
is capture information that you have on

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.120
the web or on Google or in third companies,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.440
but that is not registered

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.400
in your CRM.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.100
These two combined information

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.460
makes this whole system of

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.220
recommendations much more enriched.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.400
I didn't know it, that is, the DMP is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.720
the, let's say, is incorporating to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.060
everything we have seen of CRM,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.460
information that has not been wrapped,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.600
has not been wrapped directly within

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.740
the systems of the CRM itself, but

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.720
are interactions with other companies.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.800
If we split it into two parts, CRMs

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280
what they have is registered customer

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.700
information, the DMPs are anonymous

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.760
customer information, that

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.520
is, that are located either

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.620
by the IP or by cookies or because

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.300
you have given the data

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.320
to a third company.
