00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.800
Mirel, we already understand

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.680
what Influencer marketing

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.040
is, the benefits it has, but

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.220
now what I would like is

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.340
that we explain to any company

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.220
that has an interest in

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.240
hiring a campaign or doing a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.380
concrete action, how it has

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.420
to deal with this.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.880
Yes, the key thing is to consider

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.720
the goal of what you want

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520
to do with the Influencer Marketing

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.160
campaign.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.360
So, on this point and this brief

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.280
you have three options.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.100
You can go directly to the influencers.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Some of them work on their own

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.640
or if they don't refer you to their

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.100
representative agency.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.700
The other is to go to the agencies.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.760
There are a few of them that

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.740
are specialized in different types

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.580
of influencers.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400
They have close ties with them.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.240
As a benefit, as a disadvantage,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.600
is that your main customer is really

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.440
the represented, not you.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.400
And what they offer you is their influencers

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.280
portfolio.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.480
I have experienced the two options on

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
the advertiser's side.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.420
We have searched for influencers on

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.040
the internet, contact them, it's a roll.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.100
And in many cases the influencer

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.300
already has an agency, so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.260
at the end you start

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.440
talking and you are talking

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.060
to many agencies, so it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.900
also a roll.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.460
And if you don't have knowledge,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.500
it's all very complicated because

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.560
you talk to an influencer and you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.240
don't know if they charge five

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
or five thousand.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.180
It is difficult.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.580
I also experienced the representative

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.600
agencies.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.840
You contact agencies and the agency

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.780
what it has is a portfolio of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.880
influencers who are their representatives,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.660
who in the bottom line as

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.440
you say, are their clients.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.020
Therefore, there is a conflict of

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.620
interest because the agency has more

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.940
interest in the influencer being

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.820
happy and making money than

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.660
you are making money.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.000
Like you, there are many and another

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.780
comes, but the agency has to keep its

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.720
portfolio of influencers.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.140
And the third option is to pull

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.620
from an agency specialized in making

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.740
influencer marketing campaigns that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.640
are not talent representatives.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.940
You work with different representatives,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.220
with different influencers,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.880
etc.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.420
and correct.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.040
And that agency costs you more, obviously,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.960
because there is one intermediary

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.140
more, but it gives you a service

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.400
that the rest do not give you.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.300
And mainly it is a service of giving

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.640
you a strategy based on the briefing

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.060
you have given, the strategy, you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360
have creativity, you are selected

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.140
by influencers, you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.880
are the customer and what they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.520
look after is because all selected

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.400
contractors give the best

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340
result for that campaign.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.320
With which it may be, depending

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.260
a little on the budget you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.900
have, it can be a good option.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.740
In addition, of course, the agencies you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.260
speak of, the reach of influencers

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.300
is greater because you are no longer

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.900
limiting yourself to those who are

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.400
their representatives, but these

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.940
agencies work with different agencies

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.280
of representation.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.840
Of course, and with all kinds

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.360
of influencers on different platforms.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.960
And often, if they are not on their

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.300
radar, they look for them based on

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.060
what best fits in the proposal.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.780
In my opinion, what works best in

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.160
the sense of agencies, you have

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.380
digital agencies, communication,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.140
media, there is a whole series.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.500
I think that digital ones, which

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.460
are very specialized also in the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.100
environment of social networks

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.460
and communication networks, because

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.220
they also work influencer

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.920
marketing as an extension

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.760
of communication in public networks.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.140
Well, I think the three alternatives

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.380
we have clear, direct, representative

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.260
agencies and digital

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.620
agencies that make you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.860
a more comprehensive

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.940
plan, etc.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.420
and correct.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.280
Everyone has their pros and cons.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.280
Well, once at some point what we

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.220
do is to receive a budget and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.460
the budget can get it directly

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.500
from the influencer who says

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.840
this costs you so much or from

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.720
the agency or if it is a digital

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.340
agency, because what you do

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.560
is design a a bit more sophisticated

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.540
campaign, etc.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.620
But there is always a budget, that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.200
is, we will pay for something.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.460
and yes.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.320
So here the doubt that is generated

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.300
when you don't know is, well, but

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.240
this is expensive, it's cheap,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.740
I'm paying, then I would like

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.820
you to tell us based on that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.220
an influencer X, it doesn't matter,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.900
that it's a youtuber, depending

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.440
on that it costs X or Y.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.140
of course.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.620
Man, the price has to have a logic

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560
and in the time that has arisen

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.180
all this phenomenon of influencers

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.640
had no much logic what

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.560
was charged.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.160
Over time, it has already matured

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.720
and that there is more logic, there

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.580
are more data, there is more information.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.960
The main thing here is depending on

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.720
the campaign, the type of, especially

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.800
the format and platform, there

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.160
is a price.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.200
For that evaluation you have to

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.300
take into account, so if you are going

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.080
to do a photo campaign, what you are

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.680
interested in knowing is how many

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.160
impressions you will get about

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.280
the photo that the influencer will publish.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.260
Therefore, you have to ask the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.180
influencer or the representation

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.020
agency or the digital agency

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.440
what is the average impression

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.660
that this influencer

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.840
gets on that post.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.520
Don't look so much at the subject

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.560
of subscribers or followers because

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.800
they often don't have a logical

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.820
ratio with what they

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.960
get for each post.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.800
If you go to video, then what you

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.740
are interested in knowing is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.500
how many views that influencer has

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.160
had on average on your channel or account.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.300
Then I extract from you, that is, you

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.960
are giving us a advice that we

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.340
receive the proposal and then

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.840
we will receive a proposal with

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.540
X names.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.880
and yes.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.060
We are already talking about

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.900
who the influencers

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.660
are who recommend us.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.700
So what we have to do is a little

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.980
research that research is you do

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.220
an Excel with the names and

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.340
if they are videos, what you

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.260
do is you go to the latest

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.860
publications you have done.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.700
The last month of video posts

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.320
and that's information that's

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.600
public that you can see

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.280
how many views you've had.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.380
There is Instagram as well.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.880
That is.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.140
What you don't have on Instagram are not

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.280
the stories, but the videos of posts

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.180
if you see them or on YouTube and you're

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.680
going to mark and you're seeing

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.100
a little the relationship and that or if

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.360
you have the price to influence because

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.440
then see the relationship and if

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.220
you have the price pack the total you're

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.500
going to get if it really is worth you.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.540
Of course, that is one of the variables

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.200
that we have said the cost, which is

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.240
the cost, the return as the output would

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.340
be then if it is a video because

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.780
they are the visualizations.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.040
The return can be, that is, we can also

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.280
measure a little because the engagement

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.880
if you upload a photo and there

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.520
are many many comments is good.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.580
And also the video for example in the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.780
length of how many people are taking

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.180
to see that video.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.420
You can have many views of a

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.380
ten-minute video on YouTube

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.460
but only have seen the first

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.960
30 seconds on average.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.400
has failed.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.580
That's what you need to do is do

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.460
that little that is not complicated

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.960
well and is a more quantitative topic

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.980
but on the other hand what comes up

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.840
to me is valid but not only is quantitative

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.200
because there will also be to

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.840
value each of those influences

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.760
if it will effectively impact or

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.280
those visualizations,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.500
those comments are of people

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.220
that coincide within the no

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.300
of the audience to which I want

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.440
to get.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.610
Of course, here's what you have

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.910
to know to be clear is the demographic,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.170
the demographic analysis

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.450
of the audience.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.350
Okay, how I know it.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.090
You have to request it.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.450
That's no way to know it, you

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.990
have to ask him to influence the

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.870
agency, send you a screenshot

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.470
of its analytics, say, about the

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.670
last month and give you the

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.770
percentage by gender, age,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.910
age and geographic origin.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.450
That's crucial to have that to see

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.770
that, especially at the level of

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.670
influencer selection, that you're

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.570
reaching the target audience

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.350
that interests you.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.090
Well, then I will summarize it

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.790
in that we will use two criteria

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.290
to evaluate it, cost and

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.170
audience targeting.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.630
and correct.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.330
Then in the cost what you tell

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.270
us is a little research because

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.150
you will have different prices

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.830
and so but what to try to compare

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.270
pears with pears, we always say,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.770
what you have to do is that you

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.770
create an Excel, for example,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.850
and look to see the number of

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.810
views of the videos that has

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.530
had, the engagement that

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.330
are measured.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.290
I like them, I like them, and so on.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.590
You already have the name

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.750
of the influencer, you have what will

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.190
cost you and you already have some

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.510
metric that gives you a little information

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.130
and that you have to incorporate

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.730
another perspective that is, eye,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.570
that is that it is not only quantitative

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.410
as to the range, but that in addition

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.450
within that range you are giving

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.590
with your target audience, because

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.030
when you are shooting, as

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.770
you have a million

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.230
views, but all who see you

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.450
are not, not your customer

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.910
person, you are taking the money.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.110
So you have to request it

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.170
or you get it from the agencies or

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.030
whatever, but at some point

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.410
you have to have it.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.090
You have to go through the analytics

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.030
of the influencer account.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.670
of the account.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.410
To be able...

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.850
And they will give you data on how the

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.510
audience is, how it is, yes,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.030
the followers of the Right, correct.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.470
And last question to

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.790
understand.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.490
I would like you to explain the cost

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.670
at the level, that is, how much

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.530
money you have, what budget you

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.810
have to have, because this is a

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.150
question that comes up to a lot of

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.490
people, but this of the

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.470
influencers, for whom?

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.870
For a guy who has to spend a million

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.830
euros or I can start trying

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.230
these channels with less money.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.610
How would you explain to us?

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.670
I know there are no universal formulas.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.970
No, and it is very difficult to determine

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.670
standard parameters or values, say.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.290
You can do a campaign

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.570
with any budget.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.070
You have 2,000 euros, because

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.690
you can make a micro-

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.930
influencers campaign and get

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.910
with 2,000 euros, you can get 20,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.030
30 micro-influencers

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.130
accounts that each makes

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.310
its publication.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.390
It also depends on the platform.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.150
Obviously, platforms like Twitter

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.290
are very economical, they

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.770
don't even have a very high

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.270
ratio of viewing or interaction

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.510
results, or YouTube, which

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.710
has a higher cost because they

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.790
have a video production

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.650
that has a great value.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.050
We are not talking about 2,

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.310
3, 10 minutes.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.630
And that of recording, editing, scripting,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.010
etc., because they already have,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.330
without taking into account the prescriptor

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.930
value, the value of

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.210
production increases your budget.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.470
It can be adjusted to any value.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.890
You can make Instagram campaigns

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.590
between 5 and 10,000 euros, which

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.870
are very effective.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.470
And a large-scale national consumer

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.270
company that wants to do a big

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.530
campaign with YouTubers may

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.350
be spending 50, 60, 70,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.770
000 euros to make references.
