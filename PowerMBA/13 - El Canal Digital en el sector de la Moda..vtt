00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.150
The online sector is growing double

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.570
digit per year, now in fashion in

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.470
Europe, weighing between 11% and 13%

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.330
in Spain and is estimated to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.190
be the most popular online market.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.650
I think there are sectors in which

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.270
the digital channel will reach very

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.950
high, almost absolute, quotas.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.490
I believe that in the fashion sector,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.030
physical retail will always have

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.170
its space because the fact of choosing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.410
the clothes, seeing them, etc.,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.790
is difficult to replace.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.510
I think the experience still likes.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.730
A recent study says that by 2020,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.150
online sales will account

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.830
for 20% of all mobile phone sales.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.190
That is, that 80% will

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590
still be in retail.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.410
Of course, there is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.290
a huge growth.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.010
In fact, in the retail part, sales

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.370
growth in traffic in stores

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.770
is approximately between 2

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.350
and 3 percentage points.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.430
They sell growth.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.710
In the shops.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.030
People are increasingly going to shops

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.970
and buying more online.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.910
We are talking about falls of 2-3% in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.130
the concept of football, that this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.150
is measured.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.250
Then you are right.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.130
Retail will continue to be relevant,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.290
it is also a profitable channel

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.930
and is very relevant.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.670
And indeed there are movements such

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.250
as the purchase of Whole Foods,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.170
although we change the sector,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.570
by Amazon, which are online

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030
players that are going to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.830
retail.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.970
That is not simply because of the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.730
issue of margin, but it is a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.750
combination of several factors.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.210
You have a lot of volume still there,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.910
it's a point that can serve as a

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.110
distribution point.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.650
In the case of Amazon, this is very clear.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.190
It is a point that can serve to build

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.790
a brand and it is a point that can

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490
serve as a pick-up, to collect

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.650
and make a little omnicanal, which

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.070
is one of the challenges that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.770
the sector has.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.470
With which, undoubtedly, online is

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.410
a model, a huge opportunity and also,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.370
amongst the comics, disruptive.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.270
And there are also new players in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090
a market that is actually traditional

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.930
brands that are consolidating,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.590
then we will talk about whether it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.210
is very fragmented or not, but in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.070
any case it is beginning to have

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.370
some consolidation, although it is

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.010
very fragmented, disappear physical

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.930
retailers, but appear online very

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.230
potent, specialized

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.990
in mode, purely online, for example,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.750
Asos and Zalando, are purely

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.430
marketplaces, also

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.470
have the retail part and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.290
are doing some experiment

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770
in the physical world.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.170
In fact, Zalando a few weeks

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.010
ago opened some experimental

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.070
stores in Berlin, then you have

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.250
Alibaba that did for the 11th of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.950
11, which is a Chinese party that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.290
sells a lot, made a pop-up in

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.470
Madrid, they are beginning

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.910
to experiment and are really

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.010
very powerful in the online world.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.470
Yes, the truth is that the trend, and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430
Zalando I did not know, but for example

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.790
Amazon is clear, the trend of the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.450
large online retailers to open

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.130
physical sales points is something

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.650
very clear and it is something I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.470
think is representative that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.790
the physical selling point will

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.610
not die, because among other things,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.670
as you said, they are generated

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.730
synergistic, that is, they support

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.250
their online business through

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.390
physical sales points.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.450
Alibaba is working, it is about

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.490
to set up a 20,000 square meter

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.810
European branded shopping

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.210
center in China, with which

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.570
it is a sign.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.150
I still do not see it as something

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.690
established, I think that movements

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.490
are being made that are more pilot,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.430
experiments and I think that probably

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.850
in fashion is not the easiest place

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.030
to do so, because it is very difficult

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.510
to choose the range, when these

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.610
online brands have a range of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.310
thousands and thousands and thousands

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.630
of references, it is difficult

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.650
to put them in a physical space.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.350
With a supermarket, like in the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.650
case of Whole Foods, you have

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.410
an assortment that is obviously

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.810
giant, but you have to have what

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.050
you have to have, with obviously

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.850
a few ranges.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.370
But yes, there are obviously very

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.350
scary things happening in the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.510
online world.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.470
The online world, I think that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.470
speaking of this topic, which is that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.750
it comes out a lot in the press,

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.270
people talk a lot, if the retail

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.030
disappears or not disappears,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.670
I think it depends a lot on the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.230
sectors.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.010
We participate in an app where

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.830
you can buy lottery and the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.170
value that this app brings to you

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.930
with respect to buying at the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.230
point of sale is bestial, because

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.490
the point of sale does not

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.510
bring you any value.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.830
Then the point of sale, because obviously

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.530
I don't know how the digital channel

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.510
of the lottery world will grow,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.850
but it will end up ravaging the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.030
point of sale, but it's that there

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.570
are other sectors in which not, because

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.690
the advice or the physical

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.630
product.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.550
We are already talking about buying

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.610
something physical that you try.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.890
For in the case of fashion,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.910
I think that growth, as you said,

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.250
will be slower and will

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.850
never be majority.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.490
Yes, there are many technological

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.990
developments around the experience

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.730
of testing a garment.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.130
You have some fitting recommenders,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.350
there are several applications and

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.270
several companies that do.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.710
Amazon bought, I think it'

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.830
s recently called Skylabs

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.190
for $100 million,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.850
which basically does you

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.570
scan your body to see

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.250
how it can fit a garment.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.770
Well, there are a lot of people who are

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.030
already on Asos, for example, use

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.370
the videos instead of the

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.230
photographs so that one can see not

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.310
only the photo of the garment, but how

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.350
the garment falls, the weight it

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.130
has when it turns, how the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.350
garment will behave.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.490
There are pretty fun experiments

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.530
with virtual models to make passages,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.330
which are models that really

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.750
look like people, are made

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.970
by computer, and everything

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.710
is more like a garment, then

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.610
you pass them the pattern.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.410
It is incipient, in fact this has

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.430
been several years, and I agree

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.430
with you that in the end, especially

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.550
the experience of touching the garment

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.670
is very difficult to replace,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.210
but it is technologically advancing

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.030
and new borders and new

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.730
horizons will be opened.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.910
As we are walking was thinking

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.970
another point in favor of physical

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.430
retail in your sector, and is that

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.950
for certain people the go shopping

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.710
in clothes is entertaining,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.350
that is an experience that

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.110
nobody goes to the bank for experience,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.070
nobody will buy, I don't know,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.090
what I said, lottery for experience,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.590
is not a purely functional issue,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.330
but in your case it is a bit different

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.110
because there is still some

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.910
experience in going, in seeing,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.130
in trying you, etc., that

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.290
that from your home doesn'

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.350
t happen.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.510
This you mention is key, it is a possible

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.930
differentiating factor, it is

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.830
generating a different customer

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.070
experience.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.410
In luxury brands it is very

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.430
clear, they have had it for many

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.990
years, fast fashion also does,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.230
obviously with a much

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.450
smaller budget, but it is

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.370
something that becomes very

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.630
relevant.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.130
For example, let's put an example,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.550
and that in addition to brands make

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.330
flagships, many times they are

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.910
not profitable, but they are a

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.650
way to build a brand and transfer

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.830
an image to the customer, because

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.410
what we sell as fast fashion

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.410

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.850
only covering the need to dress

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.250
someone, but transfer an

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.650
