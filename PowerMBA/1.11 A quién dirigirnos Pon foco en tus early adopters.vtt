WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
In the process or in the decision to choose who we are heading, not only who we are heading,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.720
but in which segments of customers we focus, we put focus, we make an effort.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.880
Well, you have many alternatives, you have already done the segmentation, you have already done

00:22.880 --> 00:27.240
several segmentations depending on different variables, you have identified several customer

00:27.600 --> 00:30.680
categories, you already understand things well and you have to make the decision.

00:30.680 --> 00:39.400
And here we are going to give you a recommendation and that is to put absolute focus, focus on your

00:39.400 --> 00:42.920
ideal customers, on your early adopters, which we are going to describe now.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.280
By the way, there are people who think that early adopters are very technological people,

00:47.280 --> 00:53.200
very tech and such, those are the early adopters for technology, but early adopters is a concept

00:53.200 --> 00:57.360
that applies to any type of value proposition.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.880
And what you have to do is identify your early adopters and put a lot of focus on them.

01:02.880 --> 01:09.320
We are going to contextualize it, you have already done the segmentation, you already understand what

01:09.320 --> 01:14.960
your customer people are and you have several alternatives in terms of who to address you and

01:14.960 --> 01:19.960
especially in terms of who to focus on, who to support you to move on to the next phase

01:19.960 --> 01:24.720
of understanding them better, create proposals adapted to them, create messages adapted to them.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.000
We have several segments and here the recommendation is that you identify your early adopters and

01:30.000 --> 01:31.160
put absolute focus on them.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.960
The first thing, who are your early adopters?

01:32.960 --> 01:37.440
Well, your early adopters are, within all those customer people, those with whom your

01:37.440 --> 01:38.840
proposal fits perfectly.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.880
Those who have a pain or a problem, imagine that you give them a solution, those who see

01:43.880 --> 01:45.480
a brutal value in what you do.

01:46.480 --> 01:53.880
And as a result of this, they are your ideal customers, it is very easy to sell them, they do not judge you

01:53.880 --> 02:00.280
as buyers, that's fine, especially at the beginning, you create a proposal and if you

02:00.280 --> 02:05.560
go to many segments, those who are not early adopters, well, they are going to look at you,

02:05.560 --> 02:10.120
they are going to judge you, but the early adopters, those who fall in love with you, they are going to forgive you

02:10.120 --> 02:12.080
for the things you do wrong, that you will do some things wrong.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.600
It is easy to identify early adopters because they are the people who thank you, they are the people

02:17.600 --> 02:20.400
who show their enthusiasm, etc.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.400
But it is all a consequence of that, it is all a consequence that your proposal fits

02:25.400 --> 02:26.880
perfectly with them.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.800
Let's think, I know, you are a freelance digital marketing advisor and you can go to

02:31.800 --> 02:35.400
all kinds of companies and you have to create your proposal and your messages, etc.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.440
Well, the recommendation is that you identify a personal customer with whom you are going

02:39.760 --> 02:42.160
to enter with a knife, which would be your early adopters.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.600
Well, let's think that, for example, they are non-digital companies, sorry, that the

02:46.600 --> 02:51.160
businessman is not a native digital, that they want to start selling online or that they are

02:51.160 --> 02:55.160
making investments, that they have around ten employees, they have some money, etc.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.960
And it turns out that that personal customer is the one who, as soon as he knows the proposal

02:58.960 --> 03:03.760
of the digital marketing advisor, is that he falls in love, he has no problem paying

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760
the fee, etc.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.760
And what that advisor has to do is focus on them, focus on the early adopter,

03:09.080 --> 03:13.080
because if what he does is start saying, well, I'm going to address these, these and the others

03:13.080 --> 03:17.080
beyond, and I'm going to make a proposal that fits with everyone, well, I tell you that at the end

03:17.080 --> 03:21.080
that proposal is not going to convince even that businessman, because it is going to be a little,

03:21.080 --> 03:24.080
well, that is going to shoot messages that do not connect with anyone.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.080
When you focus, it is easier to create a proposal and some messages that connect with that segment

03:28.080 --> 03:32.080
of customers, with this personal customer, which in this case the recommendation is that

03:32.080 --> 03:34.080
you have identified who your ideal customers are.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.080
Let's think that you have created an app to learn English.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.400
Learning English is good for everyone, but if what we do is identify which is the

03:41.400 --> 03:45.400
personal customer that as soon as we impact him online, the application is downloaded,

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
he pays, etc.

03:46.400 --> 03:51.400
Imagine that they are people who have a job, who are looking for a job, but who are seeing

03:51.400 --> 03:55.400
that in the offers they ask for an English level that they do not have, for example, I do not know.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.400
So of course, he has that pain, he has no problem paying you, he is happy that you

03:59.400 --> 04:03.400
help him in this, to use an application to learn, etc.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.400
Your lottery, for example, the application to buy the lottery.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.720
If we think of people who are young, digital, used to buying on the web, who are buying

04:11.720 --> 04:15.720
on other websites that are funny, etc.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.720
Then they know your lottery and say, I can buy in this application, with this usability,

04:19.720 --> 04:21.720
they fall in love with your lottery, they are fans of your lottery from the first day.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.720
For all that, we have explained at the beginning, the recommendations that you identify your

04:25.720 --> 04:29.720
early adopters because they are the ones who buy and because you have to rely on them

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
to put absolute focus, to understand them and to focus and to create a proposal that

04:34.040 --> 04:38.040
fits with them, not with others.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.040
And so you understand what is in their head and so you study them

04:42.040 --> 04:46.040
and not others. Basically, it is for you to focus on your early adopters and the proposal

04:46.040 --> 04:50.040
and the messages you direct to early adopters and not to a lot of customers.
