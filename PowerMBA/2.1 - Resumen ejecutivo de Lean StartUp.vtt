00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.710
As the In Startup is best understood,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.090
this philosophy, this methodology,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.950
is really analysing

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.410
real cases of companies

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.830
that have implanted it.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.450
I will talk briefly about the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.230
Zappos case.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.950
Zappos is an e-commerce company

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.710
that was founded in the

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.870
United States in 1999.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.370
It grew very fast and was

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.450
bought by Amazon for $1.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.550
2 trillion.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.990
He had imitators.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.210
In Europe, for example, Zalando was

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.350
born with a model similar to Zappos.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.230
But what we’re going to do

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.170
is go to the origins.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130
Let’s see, let’s analyze how he applied

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.950
Lym’s philosophy to take his

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.430
first steps.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.770
The Zippo is born of an idea.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.950
At that time there was no e-

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.530
commerce.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.990
There was none.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.990
Then Nick Swirmon, its

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.650
founder, his idea,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
his idea is to offer a good

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.270
customer experience, a good

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.570
website navigation, a good

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.470
after-sales service, etc.,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.870
a good customer service,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.730
would be able to quickly

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.070
attract a lot of demand

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.810
and sell millions of shoes

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.510
online.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.110
But it was his idea.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.590
This idea could be right

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.970
or it could be wrong.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.830
And what he did was to apply the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.050
Lym philosophy in a radical way.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.250
I will tell you what he did.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.910
It is probably the opposite of what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.710
you would do.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.270
The first week he created a super

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.970
simple website and went to several

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.750
shoe shops to take photos of shoes.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.510
He uploaded the photos to the website

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.770
with the prices and began selling

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.290
them.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.810
He had no shoes.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.750
What he did was when a customer

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450
bought some shoes, ordered some

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.730
shoes on Zappos’s website, he

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.110
went to the shoe shop, bought

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.590
those shoes and sent them

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.910
to the customer.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.510
As you can imagine, I didn’t earn

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.990
any money, but I did not.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.870
Efficiency was very low.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.310
He did not seek efficiency.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.110
What you sought is exactly what we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.350
learned in the LYN methodology,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.890
is to validate the main hypothesis

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.610
of your business model.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.110
That was, customers are

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.590
willing to buy shoes online.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.310
He had to know it as soon as possible.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.090
And he managed to validate the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.010
model’s main hypothesis, the determining

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.270
hypothesis of whether

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970
he had gold in his hands or

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.450
if he would not even be able

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.490
to start his business, he managed

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.090
to validate it in a week.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.530
Let’s think now that it’s what you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.630
would do, or that’s what anyone

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.670
else would do.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.170
Well, what I would do is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.990
build a website, but not a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.910
web page like he did, no.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.310
You would have invested money

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.330
in a website that would have

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.130
a great user experience,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.470
which would have taken

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.730
you a lot of time and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.190
money in 1999.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.570
In addition, it is normal that you

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.570
reach agreements with shoe

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.990
suppliers and have a stock of shoes.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.970
That would have taken you time and money.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.330
Time because getting to agreements

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.710
with suppliers takes time and money

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.810
because you would have to buy

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.170
the stock in advance.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.470
It would have been on the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.770
market a year later.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050
It would have happened, thank God, in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.270
this case it would have happened that

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.870
you would have validated that hypothesis

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.910
because customers were

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.770
willing to buy.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.470
But many times it doesn’t happen

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.150
and many times what happens is that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.330
the main valid hypothesis is not,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.670
that you’ve been wrong.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.450
All that time, all that money

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.330
goes to the trash.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.710
However, what Zappos achieved is in

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.970
a week validating the main

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.750
hypothesis and also something

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.050
I want you to know and understand

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.590
because it is super valuable to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.130
get feedback from customers

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.990
from the first day.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.550
Not just feedback, but action.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.410
Zappos was able to observe what kind

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.970
of shoes he demanded more, how

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.930
they acted on the website, what their

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.870
needs were, if they returned to new

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.470
shoes, byining interactions

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.250
with them good because they understood

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.290
their customers very well

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.950
and all that in a week.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.730
Within a week, you spend

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.750
a lot of money.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.710
As we see in this case, what he

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.910
managed to do is learn, which is the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.990
key word of the Lean methodology,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.370
is to learn as soon as possible and

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.670
spend as little money as possible.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.590
Learn about whether your

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.490
business model hypotheses

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.530
were right or not.
