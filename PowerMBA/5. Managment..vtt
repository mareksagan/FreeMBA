00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.520
Understanding the concept of business

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.380
culture, the types of cultures,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.440
etc., is something absolutely

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.960
basic that helps us understand

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.300
any organization and, in addition,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.280
when we manage one, helps us

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.600
create an organization that

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.020
is appropriate to our goals.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.300
What is culture?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.200
Culture is hard

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.780
to define.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.540
We could describe it as the DNA of the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.040
company.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.780
But you will understand it better

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.400
if I tell you that culture depends

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.580
on, imagine yourself, the vision

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.760
and mission, the values, how

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.960
you manage people, whether you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.220
give them more autonomy

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.800
or less, your leadership style,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.860
how you have structured

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.880
yourself, how your offices

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.200
are, where your offices

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.180
are, etc.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.560
This is all about the culture

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.620
you are creating.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.920
So what we saw that was very interesting

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.660
is what the types of culture

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.020
are and we saw it with a matrix

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.540
in which we classified

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.760
all organizations

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.940
based on two variables

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.440
and this is very good.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.920
From now on, think of organizations

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.000
always in this way, classifying

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400
them like this.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.000
On the one hand, we can analyze what

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.860
the degree of autonomy is, that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.900
is, whether we are giving more

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.060
or less freedom to employees.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.860
There are organizations where there

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.120
is very little autonomy, everything

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580
is very procedurally, very

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.920
standardized, etc.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.780
And there are others where it is

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.180
not so, where employees have more

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.940
autonomy to innovate and more.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.420
This is on the vertical axis.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.020
And if we go to the horizontal

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.580
axis, we can rank

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.720
organizations according to

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.500
their focus on results.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.860
You can, imagine, get

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.580
something, increase sales,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.980
or revolutionize a

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.780
market, etc.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.960
They are focused on internal issues.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.440
What are the internal issues?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.160
In the processes, in the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.960
processes, etc.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.140
As I said, this classification is very

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080
good because it helps us to position

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.780
companies, it helps us to understand

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.420
them well.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.300
So, from these two dimensions,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.500
what we have is four

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.520
cultures.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.920
The first is the clone.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.120
They are cultures, organizations that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.440
are very focused on taking care of their

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.160
employees.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440
What they think is that if they have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.340
happy employees, that's going to be

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.640
passed on to their customers.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.720
We always take the example of the UFO.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.640
They are usually very flat organizations,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.300
where communication is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.540
greatly encouraged, etc.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360
We have cultures that are hierarchical.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.200
They are companies that are very

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.460
focused on processes, which

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.680
is all very standardized.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.900
They are usually very vertical.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.860
The most obvious example is the army.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.220
But we can also think, imagine,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.620
in a company like McDonald's.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.080
McDonald's is growing globally

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520
with all the processes within

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.660
each of the super-standardized stores.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.940
Everything is very processed.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.080
We have market organizations.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.780
In this case we are talking

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.660
about organizations in which

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.240
everything is also very well-

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620
proceded, but in this case

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.180
they focus on results, sales,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.120
growth, etc.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000
I would say that here almost

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.680
all the classic life-long companies,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.140
with strong commercial

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.160
structures, enter.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.760
Imagine yourself from Coca-Cola

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.580
or a pharmaceutical lab or a software

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.720
manufacturer.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.420
We would see thousands of cases.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.380
And financial institutions too.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.300
They are focused on goals,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.000
on growth.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.220
All organizations focus

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.860
on that.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.280
And finally we have the great

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.320
current trend, which are the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.460
adocratic cultures.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.660
Everyone wants to be an adocratic

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.120
organization.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.700
We are talking about flexible,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.280
but highly result-centric organizations.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.040


00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.240
The focus is external.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.260
In this case, it is not so much

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.880
sales, but we are talking

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.960
about achieving great things,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.060
ambitious goals, etc.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.220
These are usually very ambitious

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.200
companies that hire very good,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.680
quite expensive people, give

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.480
them a lot of freedom,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.200
work on projects, are often demanding

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.460
organizations, etc.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.560
I think the clearest examples

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.860
could be companies like Facebook

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.580
or like the American startups.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.160
By pure general culture you should

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.020
already know how organizations are structured.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.320
Per we could make a prior classification

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.400
between organizations that

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.900
are more flat or more horizontal

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.800
and those that are more

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.480
vertical.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.620
But actually the four main

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320
types of organizational structures

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.820
are functional, by division,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.220
matricial and by project.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.640
Functional organizations, the first

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.780
type of organizations, are organizations

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.660
that are structured by

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.740
functions, marketing,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.180
sales, operations, finance,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.600
etc.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
What is happening with this?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.460
That very poor communication

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.680
between the different functions

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.660
or departments is generated and the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.200
outfocus is bestial.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.600
They are very little focused on results.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.900
Then the divisions were created.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.420
We are talking about divisions

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.280
by a business line or by a

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.460
customer segment.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.620
They are structures that

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.260
are more oriented towards customers

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.780
or results, etc.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.400
That is the big advantage.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.360
Returning these two are the matrices

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.620
that we do is combine the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.900
best of the two approaches.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.920
You have a matrix in which you

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.240
structure your organization by functions

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.860
and by divisions.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.400
The current trend is to

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.280
structure companies by projects.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.820
It is as if you are creating, within

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.600
your structure or your company, mini-

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.380
businesses that are made up of teams

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.200
that are multidisciplinary,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.800
made up of people of various

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.400
functions and that are attempted

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.000
to have the greatest possible

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.180
autonomy.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.980
This is usually done in the most

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.400
leading organizations, which

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.160
are adocratic cultures.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.340
In addition, these teams often apply agile

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.900
methodologies for the management of

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.200
those projects.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.040
The system in which companies

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.640
have been supported since the

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.440
1950s to manage their employees,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.360
evaluate them, etc., is called

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.320
performance management

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.220
system, goal management system.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.880
But this is pretty overdue, especially

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.220
in the most innovative companies,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.540
that what is now used are

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.720
the OKRs, key goals and

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.840
results.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.780
It is used by Google, the American

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.720
startups, the most cutting-edge Spanish

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.540
startups, etc.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.700
It's a very simple

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.880
system, but it works

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.740
very well.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.560
Let us explain how it is.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.600
OKR, as I said, is

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.820
key goals and results.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.740
First, set goals.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.540
You have to set goals that

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.720
have to be challenging,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.300
delightful, launch a new product

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.720
that becomes the market

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.360
leader.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.620
What is defined are

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.660
key results.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.800
There are 3 to 5 key outcomes

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.140
related to this goal.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.000
Key results are indicators

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.520
that tell us whether we are

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.840
on the right track or not

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.800
to that goal.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.700
The objective is not quantifiable

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.660
and the key results yes.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.980
By the way, key results

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.140
have to be difficult to.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.000
Not impossible, not a madness, but

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.060
they have to be tough challengers.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.380
The OKRs, this we have seen,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.980
key goals and outcomes, are

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.920
defined in 3 levels primarily.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.080
At the level of the entire organization,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.220
with strategic goals, we could

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.300
do it by teams and we could

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.480
do it for each of the

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.160
people.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.640
All this is done in cascade.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.050
What are the advantages of all this?

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.930
What is it useful for?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.170
Why is it so good even though

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.310
it is so simple?

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.210
It serves us to direct all the efforts

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.570
of the entire organization towards

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.550
the strategic goals.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.670
This is very important because

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.430
there is usually a lot of disruption

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.510
in companies.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.350
There are a lot of people doing things,

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.630
but they don't really know themselves

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.530
or are not oriented to what

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.290
really matters.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.810
OKRs help us always focus on

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.750
what is important every week.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.050
Then it serves for each member of

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.690
the team, each person, to always

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.870
keep in mind what is important,

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.150
their goals, their key results,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.170
and avoid the fact that they

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.290
go to the office and do things

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.610
to do, do tasks, which as I

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.570
said always generates disallocation.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.170
In addition, it increases

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.970
motivation very much, because

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.230
as you know, how your work is

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.570
contributing to the company's strategic

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.130
goals, you feel more connected,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.930
than when you don't know

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.530
very well why you do what

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.070
you do.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.590
It also provides a lot of transparency

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.930
throughout the organization and improves

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.870
communication, etc.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.190
Because everyone knows the OKR

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.230
of the rest.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.030
This is not like the performance

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.470
management system in which your

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.990
manager sets you goals and

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.810
that nobody knows.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.910
No, this is a completely

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.670
transparent issue.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.830
Everyone has to know what the CEO'

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.470
s OKR is, those of the organization,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.830
those of their team, theirs,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.910
how they are contributing,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.930
etc.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.910
AGL is a philosophy under which many

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.110
tools, many methodologies, such

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.190
as Lean Startup, which you already

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.710
know, or as Scrum, or as Kanban,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.450
or as DesignThinking, are englobed.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.610
There are really a lot.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.370
It is like a toolbox that is born

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.570
to give a response or to help

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.430
us manage companies in the

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.950
current environment, in the current

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.710
situation.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.810
What do I mean by this?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.910
It is important to remember that traditional

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.090
management is born in a different

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.750
environment.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.330
It came from a different time

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.790
when uncertainty was less.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.350
It helps us manage in uncertain

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.410
environments.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.330
What do I mean by little uncertainty?

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.690
You basically know what will

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.170
happen from your actions.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.530
In contrast, the world is increasingly

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.110
dynamic, there is more risk, everything

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.370
changes faster, and in addition,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.590
companies have the permanent

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.350
need to innovate to be competitive.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.490
And already when you innovate,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.310
the uncertainty is huge, because you

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.310
don't know what's going to happen.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.090
From this, Agile is

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.770
born.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.630
And that's why Agile methodologies

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.150
help us to deal with environments

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.830
of great uncertainty.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.510
With a different approach, with a different

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.270
set of values.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.910
So what we've seen in The

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.890
Power MBA is how to use Agile

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.250
to manage projects.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.550
We have developed the Scrum methodology.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.750
And we saw that there are a number

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.370
of principles that can help us a lot.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.230
And basically they are very easy to understand.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.130
What we will do is not give for granted

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.510
that we know what the final scope

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.850
of the project is.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.110
You imagine, I don't know, what do

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.730
you want to ride?

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.830
I don't know, I don't know,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.310
a website.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.850
Well, because we will not plan a

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.830
whole long-term project, starting

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.890
from the fact that we want the

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.770
website to finally be like that.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.790
We will not do this, we will not

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.610
give the scope for granted.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.150
We will work in very

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
short cycles.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.330
We'll work in very short cycles

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.130
with small ranges, this is called

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:20.890
Sprints.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.750
Instead of a very long project,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.530
we work on small sprints.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.090
Why is?

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.110
Because when working on small Sprints,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.410
making permanent checkpoints,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.290
what we do is always identify

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.750
as soon as possible whether

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.730
we are on the right track or not.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.750
This allows us to quickly identify

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.290
if we are mistaken.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.490
And as we start from the premise

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.670
that in very many cases we will be

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.130
wrong, because it is so in environments

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.930
of high uncertainty, well, because

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.830
what we do is identify

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.250
quickly that we have been wrong.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.930
Then we pivot, modify, etc.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.990
Another thing we learned is that

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.230
we will create multidisciplinary

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.070
teams that are made up

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.550
of people from all functions.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.550
It's basically like you're creating

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.410
a mini-company, because they

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.990
have to be totally autonomous.
