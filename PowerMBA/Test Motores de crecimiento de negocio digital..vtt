00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.110
We are going to get the answers to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.710
the digital growth engine test.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.570
How much does each customer generate?

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.950
It is a very important metrics that

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.010
since knowing well is the customer

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.170
lifetime value.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.510
How much do we earn with each customer?

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.690
The important thing here is to consider

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.930
the difference between the previous

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.870
question and this one.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.010
We were talking about how much we

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.450
generate from the income.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.750
Now we ask how much

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.530
we earn.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.930
The difference between billing and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.130
earning or between income

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.290
and profit is very important.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.530
The most appropriate metrics are the

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.610
customer lifetime value minus

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.430
the car.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.560
The customer lifetime value

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.500
report...

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440
The correct answer is C and I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.140
will explain it.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.540
In A and B we are talking about

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.940
a period of time.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.840
The customer lifetime value indicates

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.040
the value that a customer generates

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.900
throughout his or her life.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.040
What is the customer lifetime

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.780
value?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.360
of the ARPU.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.740
The ARPU is the income generated by

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.900
a customer over a medium period of time.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.360
So, if the lifetime or average

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.440
time stays within a customer

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.980
too, and the churn rate is

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.640
the percentage of customers

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.100
who drop off over a period

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.820
of time.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.520
These three variables affect

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.940
or have an impact on the customer

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.860
lifetime value.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.000
The churn rate is the percentage

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.280
of customers who give up, correct.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.420
To calculate the CAC, the following

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.900
variables must be taken into account.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.140
What we invest directly in customer

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.420
capture, yes, the number of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.420
customers captured as well,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.940
and the costs associated with

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.140
customer capture such as

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.940
marketing staff.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.820
All the answers are correct.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.860
The CAC is actually calculated by

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.400
summing up all the investment

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.960
you have made in customer

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.380
capture, either directly or indirectly,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.540
such as marketing staff, and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.880
dividing it by the number

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.160
of customers captured.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.240
There should always be a balance

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.780
between the customer lifetime value,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.200
that is, what we get for a long-

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.680
rise customer and what it costs

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.300
us to capture it.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.800
Can the customer lifetime value

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.860
be calculated?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.840
Both options are correct.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.760
On the one hand, we can calculate

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.160
it as what we get for a customer

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.100
in a year, and we multiply

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.260
it by the number of years of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800
average that a customer remains.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.520
And we could also calculate

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240
it as what we get for a customer

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.040
of average in a year, by the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.580
chance rate, by the percentage

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.940
of customers who give

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.620
off.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.660
This is a slightly more sophisticated

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.880
way but we have come to the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.820
same result.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.460
Increasing the customer lifetime

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.240
value gives us room to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.760
increase the cost of capture.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.680
If we get more for each

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200
of our customers, what

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.700
allows us to invest more

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.520
in the acquisition of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.360
each of them.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.850
We will think of the ARPU of a social

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.130
network and the ARPU of an e-commerce.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.810
Well, because in a social network

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.070
you actually get a low income

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.450
for each of the customers.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.410
What happens is that you have millions of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.670
customers and it is also that it has cost

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.930
you very little to capture them because

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.210
you benefit from virality.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.850
But the ARPU is lower than that of

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.290
an e-commerce.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.550
In an e-commerce you monetize

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.890
very directly with larger margins

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.390
than in a social network.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.830
It is easier to grow the higher

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.770
the target CAC.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.870
This is a matter that you must understand

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.550
well.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.970
If you can afford to capture,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.030
let's put an example, at $10

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.610
instead of $5, that target CAC

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.990
allows you to invest in

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.270
more capture channels,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.750
diversify, take more risks

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.330
or invest more aggressively.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.410


00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.010
Therefore, the higher the CAC you can

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.030
afford, the more you will grow and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.670
the more reach you will have.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.650
In the pay growth engine,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.230
the goal is to maximize the margin.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.370
The customer electronics is correct.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.470
And also, the lower the CAC payback,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.910
that is, the sooner we recover

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.250
the investment, the sooner

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.990
we can reinvest in capture channels,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.530
correct.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.450
And the last thing we say here is

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.870
that if the CAC payback is very low,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.230
imagine that we get the investment

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.310
back in 15 days or a week.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.270
He says, we could finance all growth

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.170
with our own operations

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.530
without the need for additional

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.330
funding.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.430
It is also true.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.870
Always getting extra funding

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.490
allows you to catch faster.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.550
But if what we have is a business

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.210
in which we make

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.830
a profit, say we recover

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.910
the investment very quickly,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.370
we could finance all the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.730
growth simply with the company'

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.970
s own operations.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.710
How much do we multiply our

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.430
marketing investment?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.570
We can tell if we divide,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.110
if the customer left hand value

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.970
between what we have invested

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.470
in each of the customers.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.710
Hawkers' growth engine is

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.710
paying.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.210
The growth engine of a company

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.410
like ActiCampaign, which is software

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.130
as a service, is a marketing

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.290
automation software that

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.970
companies use, which is it?

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.270
The key is that the engine is

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.110
sticky or sticky.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.030
Why is?

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.050
Because usually this type of

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.490
company benefits from high

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.630
exchange costs and customers

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.850
of these companies that use

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.630
this type of software ultimately

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.730
use it for a very high

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.810
period of time.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.440
The growth engine of a social network

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.100
is clearly viral.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.680
Social networks try to invest

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.240
as little as possible in each version

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.060
of customers because the use

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.600
of the social network allows them

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.380
to generate new customers.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.460
When a company grows as a social

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.600
network virally, the CAC is usually

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.760
very low, effectively.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.600
Keep in mind that if the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.840
virality coefficient is higher than

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840
one, you could grow almost without

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.960
investing in your customer attraction.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.740
And, in addition, you could have users

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.380
with a very low customer left hand.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.480
Also, if it has cost you very

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.560
little to capture each of the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.000
customers, you could have millions

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.080
of users and you't have

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.000
the need to get a high income

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.940
for each of them.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.860
So both are correct.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760
The growth engine of an audiovisual

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.880
content platform or

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.440
Netflix or HBO is clearly

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.880
a sticky or sticky engine.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.600
The only thing they have to do is ensure

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.200
that you as a customer never give up.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.200
That is the key to management.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.820
And finally, the key metrics

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.980
you should monitor when your

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.280
growth engine is sticky, what

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.740
is it?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.700
This is the chant rate.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.340
As we said before, what you

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.360
have to monitor permanently,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.520
what you have to manage is

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.740
that they don't let you down.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.020
This is really the main

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.000
growth momentum.
