00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.920
Generic sports strategies are an excellent

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.220
tool and that is why we have put

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.800
so much focus, because it helps

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.980
very well to understand how the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.980
different sources of competitive

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.300
advantage or the strategies

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.360
that a company has are.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.860
However, if we take it in a very

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.020
strict way, there may be companies

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.120
that we don’t know where to

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.340
frame them and let’s see,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.200
let’s see why.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.860
We will look at the strategy

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.200
of cost leadership and you choose

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
cost leadership, what you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.900
have to do is reduce costs throughout

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.100
your entire value chain

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.960
and your customers will

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360
choose you by price.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.860
Here is the example of Ryanair.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.120
Ryanair customers choose Ryanair

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.240
by price and your customers will

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.680
be very unfaithful and almost

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220
impossible that with a strategy

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.720
If we go to the differentiation

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.500
strategy is the opposite.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.660
Your customers, like the case of the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.960
OEB, choose you because there is something

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.980
in your proposal that they like

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.480
and also you usually get to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.140
have some loyalty or fidelity

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.080
with customers.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.660
But now I will put the case of several

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.520
companies such as Ikea, for example,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.140
or Zara or Mercadona or Toyota

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.780
and we will reason if they

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.640
fit more within the strategy

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.960
of cost leadership or differentiation.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840


00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.940
Because it is complex.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.400
Mercadona, for example, is a company

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.060
that is a clear leader in cost

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.300
but yet there are hundreds of thousands

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.520
of customers who are absolutely

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.960
loyal to Mercadona who

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.700
do not choose Mercadona

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900
for cost alone.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.780
So it’s already complicating

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.180
us, we don’t know where to place

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.540
it and we would say the same with Ikea,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.660
with Zara, with Toyota, either.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.260
This is why a new strategy has

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.740
been created called Best Cost Strategy,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.100
which is the best cost strategy

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.420
and we will analyze it with

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.700
the case of Ikea.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.560
IKEA is the clear leader in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.320
cost of its industry.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.820
In addition, as it grew, it gained

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.280
an enormous market share

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.720
thanks to having very lower costs

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.680
than the rest of its competitors,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.060
its enormous scale economy

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.040
and being able to impact

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.880
those cost savings on the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.620
final product prices.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.760
And there are many tests, it is very

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.500
very very efficient in terms of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.560
all logistics, warehouses, etc.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.740
And also, for example, another

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.980
example of their bet on cost

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.600
leadership is the fact that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.760
you have to mount the furniture,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.860
that it is not mounted.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.900
The service level has been reduced

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.100
with the aim of reducing costs.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.840
However, I think that Ikea,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.780
from that huge economy of scale

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.980
and by making certain innovations

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.340
in its value proposal, has

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.780
managed to incorporate certain

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.260
factors or certain particularities

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.320
that fit more within

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.880
a differentiation strategy.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.280
If we think about it, if we follow

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.260
the criterion of whether customers

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.300
choose Ikea only for cheap or there

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.200
are customers who also choose you for

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.860
some differential factor that they

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.040
like from Ikea, I think the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.900
answer is yes.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.980
There are customers, there are many customers

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.740
who buy Ikea not just because it is

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.020
cheap, but because it brings them

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.380
things they like.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.860
I will give you an example.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.200
Ikea’s return policy does not correspond

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.280
to a low cost company, because

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.500
it does not contribute to saving.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.060
Having a policy like that you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.500
have that you can return the product

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.280
is extreme.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.580
In 365 days, even if you have used

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.140
it, you can change it for another.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.420
If your policy is strictly low cost,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.300
don’t allow yourself to do these

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.100
because it obviously doesn’t contribute.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.740
Otherwise, if your primary goal

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.160
is to reduce costs, you would

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.500
have a return policy that would

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.220
have to be scratched legal or

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.640
strictly within the legal limit.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.840
For example, Ikea catalogues provide

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.460
value to Ikea customers because

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.340
they can pick up ideas in their

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.740
homes, etc., choose the mobile phones

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.800
they will buy before going

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.720
to the point of sale.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.400
This is clear that it does not

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.900
correspond to a strictly low

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.460
cost policy, because it spends a lot

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.660
of money on distributing millions

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.440
of catalogues around the world.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.420
In addition, Ikea brings other differential

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.420
values, for example, design.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.160
I think it’s the result of the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.440
huge economics of scale, because

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.360
despite being the cost leader,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.420
with that size you can afford

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.720
to hire designers, etc.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700
You can invest in product

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.620
design, but investing in design

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.200
is not a low-cost strategy.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.640


00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.340
A company that competes strictly

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.060
on low cost would have to invest

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.660
as little as possible.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.360
Another factor that contributes

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.660
to people buying at Ikea,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.900
not just by price, is the huge

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.420
range or variety of range.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.540
This provides a lot of comfort

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.640
for customers.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.840
A customer at Ikea, not only

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.520
furnish it, but buy everything

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.540
you need for a home.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.440
This is clearly an added value

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.020
that Ikea is able to bring and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.640
that makes its customers not

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.160
just buy it for price and

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.960
also be loyal.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.100
Therefore, Ikea responds just

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.200
as it can be Toyota or Mercadona

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.580
or Zara, which we will analyze

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
in detail, responds to a generic

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.580
strategy that does not correspond

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.820
with cost leadership or differentiation

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.120
or said, but could be

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.300
considered best cost

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.660
strategy, the best

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.960
cost strategy.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.260
They have relatively

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.980
low prices and costs compared to

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.740
the rest of the industry,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.160
however, they are able to provide

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.020
differential values that

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.660
make their customers loyal.
