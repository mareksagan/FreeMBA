WEBVTT

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.620
We must learn to make presentations

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.600
that are attractive from the visual

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.560
perspective, from the perspective

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.080
of the message, of the content,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.680
of the structure, etc.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.100
This is what we call the pitch

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.200
deck, which is the presentation

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.440
that is used to communicate

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.980
with investors, to communicate

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.000
with the ecosystem, etc.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.320
You probably call it a business plan,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.600
but in the world of startup

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.920
it’s called a pitch deck.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.300
And we will do the following.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.040
First, we will share

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.540
a few general advice.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.540
In addition, we will propose a deck

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
proposal with a concrete structure,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.040
which is inspired by the recommendations

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.660
of Sequoia Capital, which

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.960
is one of the world’s most

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.980
important venture capital

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.980
companies.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.400
You can adapt it to your own situation,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.660
but it is good to have it.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.240
And what we’re going to do is share

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.540
a series of Powerpoint

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.980
presentations, empty, so that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.220
you can inspire yourself

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.860
in them or pick it up and adapt

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.700
the colors, put your logo,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180
change the texts, etc.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.060
Let’s start with the advice.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.540
I would tell you that the pitch deck

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.840
doesn’t have to have more than 10

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.180
or 15 slides, it doesn’t

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.220
have to be too long.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.540
In each slide, we should

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.820
communicate

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.180
an idea.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.500
These slides in which there are thousands of

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.020
things that are difficult to understand, etc.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760
A lot of laughter.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.360
Avoid bullet points.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.360
It is better to invest some time

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.400
in making a presentation that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.600
is a bit more aesthetic, more

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.220
graphic, more visual, and that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740
is not listed with bullet points.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.580
The less text the better.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.580
There is a maximum that is the less

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.760
text you put in a presentation,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.000
on a web page, etc.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.840
There is a greater likelihood that you will read

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.580
this text.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.340
It must be enough text

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.960
to not generate excessive

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.080
doubts, but not boring.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.160
And lastly, what is very obvious,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.020
is that it is important to take care of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.800
the design.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.000
And I know this is not easy because

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.560
a lot of people have never done a presentation,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.100
but it is important to take

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.240
care of the design because the image

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.940
you are, the message you are transmitting

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.140
if your presentation is shitty,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.960
because it generates a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.940
lot of uncertainty.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.460
It’s like getting a curriculum.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.240
You get two curriculum vitae from two

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.160
people with the same professional

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.100
experience.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.600
One is aesthetically careful and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.120
the other is not.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.640
The message is not just a subject

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640
of making it more attractive to see,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760
but the message you are sending is

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.880
much more powerful, because you are

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.300
sending a message that you are a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.500
careful person, that you have done

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.400
it with mime, that you care about the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.220
detail, etc.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.700
You have in mind that in very many

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.880
startups one of the back keys

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.720
will be, for example, that you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.420
are able to load an attractive brand.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.840
Well, then if your deck is shabby,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.100
because it’s hard for someone to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.520
believe in you, that they believe

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
you’ll be able to load an attractive

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.040
brand.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.940
We will see a proposed structure

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.680
of pitch deck and also we will

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.180
see it on this presentation

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.380
that you can download

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.900
in PowerPoint and you can

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.680
adapt the aesthetics.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.980
We will also give you more presentations

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.260
so you can get more

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.180
resources.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.100
The structure we propose in principle

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.640
is this, it is inspired by the recommendation

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080
of Secuio Capital, which is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.760
one of the largest venture capital

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.880
in the world and we have made

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.840
some small adaptation.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.160
We will go and see block

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.280
by block.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.560
We should start with a one-

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.300
line or a short text in which

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.380
we explain in a very simple and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.880
very synthesized way what

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.300
we do for who and why.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.700
Because it helps, because in the first slide

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.380
you already help the interlocutor to understand

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.660
what we are talking about.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.360
And here I leave you some examples,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.620
for example Airbnb book

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.640
rooms with locals or locals

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.900
better than hotels.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.960
Well, it is very easy to understand.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
In the case of YouTube, for

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.980
example, they incorporated it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.800
purpose, mission or vision.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.540
The next block is the problem.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.740
We need to define, identify and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.780
make very clear what

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600
the problem is currently.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.680
Not just what the problem is,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.440
but how our target audience

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.560
is currently solving that problem.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.840
I’m going to give you an example of Uber,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.280
which shows how the taxi world was

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.980
in 2008.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.080
The YouTube page explains

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.640
the problems in a very simple

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.300
way.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.200
The video files are too

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.520
large, too heavy, and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.460
can’t be sent by email.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.000
It is very well explained.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.680
You have to be very specific.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.980
Look at Airbnb, as it explains.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.460


00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.320
The price is a big concern for

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.360
many people when they have to

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.640
book online travel, hotels,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.720
etc.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.820
Explain in detail what problems

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.980
people had at the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.160
time and what Airbnb

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.520
has solved.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.100
So now is the next point.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.760
We need to explain what solutions

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.200
we are giving to these specific

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.260
problems.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.600
How we will make the lives of

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.640
our customers better.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.280
Check out Airbnb.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.120
Save money, make money and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.480
also live experiences,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.360
share culture.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.020
At this point it is convenient

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.200
the more you can describe, the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.600
better you can describe how your

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.780
product is.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.180
Screenshots, imagine you

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.540
have an app, app screenshots,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.920
functionalities, etc.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.320
The more you help to

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.100
tangibly it, the much better.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.860
Here, for example, we could

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.980
rely on customer testimonials

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.120
if you have them.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.260
That is, be creative and all you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.560
can help to better understand the

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.080
product and the value it brings,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.040
much better.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.230
The next block is

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.810
related to opportunity,

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.130
it is related to why now.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.910
And here what we can support ourselves

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.070
is, for example, market

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.770
trends.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.650
Imagine you’re relying on a technology

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.930
that will grow in the coming

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.150
years, etc.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.770
Well, you have to convince your

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.090
interlocutor that there is actually

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.790
an opportunity to undertake this

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.050
project now.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.570
The next important point

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.110
is the size of the market.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.230
Remember that no one will invest

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.870
in projects where, in addition

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.250
to high risk, the size of the

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.790
market is limited.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.810
So you have to convince

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.490
that there is indeed

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.270
a market large enough

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.630
to create a giant company.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.250
In the case of Uber, then well, it

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.050
gives the data of the taxi market

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.870
at that time.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.950
And look at Airbnb, as

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.010
it describes it very simply.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.070
This has to be the aesthetics of the deck,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.990
because very graphic, that is understood

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.910
very well, etc.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.270
We will give you resources

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.270
so you can do it.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.610
The next point is competition.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.870
We have to identify what our

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.890
direct and indirect competition

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.230
is, even what the future competition

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.570
may be.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.110
You have to do a competitor

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.890
analysis.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.230
We should analyze what they are

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.690
better than us, what we are

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.050
better than them, what competitive

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.650
advantage we could

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.130
develop, etc.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.250
If you do it in a very graphic

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.090
way, better.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.390
Look at the case of Airbnb, which does it

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.070
in a matrix, depending on whether transactions

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.170
are online, offline, whether

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.590
they are more or less expensive, etc.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.070
Or here we have the case of

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.610
Mixpanel, which, well, that does

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.350
the same, very graphically, places

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.810
all its competitors.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.070
Let’s now go to the business

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.450
model, that is, how we will

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.010
make money.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.470
We need to explain it in the

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.950
simplest way possible.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.690
Airbnb is very simple, because it is

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.650
very easy to do this.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.150
10% is paid as a commission

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.570
on each transaction.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.430
And what it does is quantify the

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.270
market and estimate the revenue it

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.910
will generate in the coming years.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.410
Go with the team.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.470
The equipment, as you know,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.090
is very important because investors

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.030
usually invest in people.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.750
And really one of the keys is

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.950
not only that your project

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.230
makes sense, is viable,

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.010
is reversible, but that

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.410
you and your team are trained

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.990
to take it forward.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.470
Therefore, you must highlight

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.630
what your values, your competences,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.370
your experience, etc. are.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.060
We should also incorporate,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.100
whenever possible, a slide in

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.840
which we are detailing what

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.060
we have achieved, what we have

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.860
achieved, what the attraction is.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.340
And you can do it by making a projection,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.100
imagine, with some metrics, or

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.500
you could put it in landmarks.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.840
This depends on what you have achieved.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.140
In the case of buffer, for example,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.120
they explain a series of

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.160
bullets what the data is as

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.600
to users, as to income, as

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.660
to margin, etc.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.580
And what were the different milestones,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.280
the different milestones?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.300
In the case of front, what they talk about

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.780
in this slide is that they have been

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.260
very efficient using capital.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.080
And finally, the last of the blocks,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.460
would have to incorporate certain

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.580
financial, economic and financial data.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.680
There is no need to get bored here,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.680
but it would be good, if we have

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.260
them, to incorporate historical

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.340
data and also some projections of

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.680
the main magnitudes of the

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.280
balance sheet, or mainly

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.900
results such as EBITDA, such as

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.260
net profit, etc., or cash

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:26.800
flows.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.560
As we can see on the screen, there

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.760
is no need to be excessive detail.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.980
In addition, we should give,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.620
for example, if you are raising

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.620
capital, you should give information

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.580
about the previous rounds you

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.120
have earned, what you have spent

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.680
that money on and what you will

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.900
use the money you will now get

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.800
in the next round.
