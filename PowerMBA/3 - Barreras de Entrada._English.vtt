00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.440
Today we will go deeper into one of

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.500
the key concepts to understand a

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
sector, to understand the competitive

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.100
struggle, to understand the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.460
profitabilities that a company

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.400
can get and are the barriers to entry.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.380
In the previous class Michael

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.520
Porter already determined that one

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820
of the five forces was the threat

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.240
of potential competitors and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.500
depending on whether there was

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.640
more threat or less threat, that

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.120
influenced competitive warfare

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.160
and ultimately in those who talk

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.760
about entry barriers, such as

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.380
Warren Buffett, who is the investor

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.460
who has demonstrated more skill

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.560
to identify good opportunities

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
in the world and Warren Buffett

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400
tells us that he only invests

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.380
in that are like a castle that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.800
have a pit around, to him,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.820
he calls the pit to the entry

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.460
barrier and says he wants

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.720
that pit to be full of sharks

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.660
to protect from the threats

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.180
of potential competitors.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.660
They only invest in where they

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.940
consider the entry barrier

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.200
to be too big.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.640
By the way, the entry barrier depends

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
on where you look at it, it is an

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.540
advantage or an inconvenience, if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.900
you are within the sector, if

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.120
you are of those who share the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.900
game in the sector, well, because

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.340
the entry barrier benefits you a lot.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.000
If you are out, then the opposite,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.140
because it is much harder

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.840
to enter.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.920
What happens in a business

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.740
when there are no barriers?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.120
When there are no barriers to entry,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.620
a sector becomes a red ocean,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.240
which we have already explained

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.060
many times.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.720
What happens is that competitive

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.720
warfare increases, there

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
are price wars, etc.,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.540
because anyone can compete,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.560
right?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.300
But well, what I really think is

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.560
interesting today is that we

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.440
analyze what are the factors or

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.740
some of the main factors

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.800
that encourage you to be protected,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.680
right?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.300
They encourage that entry

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.480
barrier and I think it’

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.920
s very enriching to think

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680
and understand the entry barriers

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.240
for at any level.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.340
And indeed, anyone who has a business

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.500
or who is a manager of a company should

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.420
think about how to set up entry

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.040
barriers, how to protect yourself

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.000
from your competitors,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.200
because there are many mechanisms

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.420
to do so, right?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.900
Let’s not just think of, I don’

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.680
t know, huge companies, but that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.480
applies to all levels.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.420
And let us start.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.040
Let us look at the main factors.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720
Economics is always mentioned.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.260


00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.340
What is a Scale Economy?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.160
Scale economy is when to compete

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.740
in a sector you have to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.440
be very, very, very large.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.100
If you are not very big, you can’t compete.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.160
We will think of sectors, for example,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.740
such as the large distribution.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.320
A common example of scale economy

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.440
is Walmart, which is probably

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.020
the largest retailer in the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.240
United States.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.840
Well, then to compete with Walmart

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.360
or to compete with Amazon,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.020
for example, to compete in certain

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020
sectors, you have to be huge,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.820
because if you are not huge,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.580
you don’t have the power to negotiate

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.180
with suppliers, to get

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.760
advantageous conditions

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.600
that allow you to be

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.700
competitive.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.780
There are sectors in which there

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.560
is no need, but in sectors where

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.920
the sensitivity to the price is

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.480
usually very high by the buyer,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.660
because you are able to offer those

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.200
prices thanks to the scale

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.840
you have reached or if you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.560
are not out.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.880
A huge barrier of entry that is relatively

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.000
recent, which we have already studied

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.480
in the course of platform strategy,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.780
are those that José del Barrio

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.080
spoke to us, who he invested

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.580
in marketplaces mainly for

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.120
this, by the network economies

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.060
that were generated.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.620
It is protection, remember,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.800
that occurs at the moment

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.340
you add to all supply

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.480
and demand.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.540
So, and that you have reached a huge

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.900
critical mass and that allows

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.600
you to generate a lot of value,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.760
but all those below, who do not

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.740
have that critical mass, can not

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.780
generate the value you generate

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.940
and are also blocked,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.000
right?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.160
And this is given in marketplaces,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.100
on platforms at all levels and I

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.400
put you one in Spain, Bookme.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.700
Bookme is a marketplace

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.780
that connects beauty centers,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.380
hairdressers, etc., with

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.740
customers, mainly with clients,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.520
right?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.880
I’m not talking about Amazon,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.960
I’m talking about a local

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.540
or national marketplace

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.440
in Spain.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.980
Well, because it has generated an enormous

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.160
barrier of entry because it has added

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.860
to the main beauty centers in

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.860
Spain, then it provides a lot

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.140
of value to customers, but of course,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.600
if I now wanted to compete from scratch

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.860
with Bookme, because it would

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.540
have a lot, a lot of difficulty,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.220
imagine, because it would have

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.840
to start convincing beauty centers

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.900
when Bookme already

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.940
exists, right?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.580
And it would not be worth it to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.600
one or another.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.820
Another major barrier to entry

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.820
is the brand.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.700
When you have a brand, when you are

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.980
able to build a love mark, a very

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.020
powerful brand with which customers

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.600
feel identified, recognized

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.460
worldwide, well, at the local

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.740
level, but very powerful,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.080
of course, it protects

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.560
you a lot.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.500
There are examples, the most extreme

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.340
examples, because it could be, then,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.660
for example, Coca-Cola, right?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.420
Nike is a brand worldwide.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.740
So, back to Warren Buffett.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.580
Warren Buffett once said that if you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.280
offer him $100 billion and challenge

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.220
him to take away Coca-Cola’s elite,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.060
the protection that Coca-Cola has

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.980
is so great that he would tell

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.480
you that you’ll stay with the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.660
$100 billion that’s impossible,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.600
right?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040
And one of the reasons for that, one

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.600
of the main reasons is the brand that

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.140
Coca-Cola has, which is irreplaceable.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.160
Another entry barrier is in the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160
case where you, in order to enter

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.360
to compete in a sector, need to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.580
make a huge investment.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.400
Of course, companies that are within

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.980
sectors in which you have to

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.240
invest a lot of money to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.560
enter are more protected than

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.620
those in which it takes very

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.180
little.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.480
You think you have to make investments

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.540
in immobilized like the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.640
one we have on screen.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.600
Well, then, it’s more, there are

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600
fewer people outside the sector who

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.100
have the ability to access financial

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.480
resources to invest hundreds

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.720
of millions or tens of millions,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.260
right?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.880
assets of this type.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.540
Now, let’s go to the exchange costs.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.880
It’s a concept that we’ve seen several

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.760
times too and I would like

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.020
you to understand well.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.160
There are sectors, and I go back to the

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.220
software sector, which I have already

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.520
put as an example on other occasions,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.200
there are sectors that have their

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.380
customers stuck.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.020
I have lived it because I have been a

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.740
strategic consultant for various software

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.040
manufacturers and have lived,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.160
have lived that, have lived the effect

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.460
that is given.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.080
Customers, however

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.160
dissatisfied they may be,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.420
in some cases will not change

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.680
or have, are very discouraged

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.880
to change.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.640
Imagine the huge barrier that

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.120
it is, the huge protection

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.260
that it is for software

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.140
manufacturers.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.240
Because if you want to enter,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.160
if you want to enter a market of

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.780
this type and you have to convince those

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.480
customers for whom to change

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.480
is very difficult, because, of

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.240
course, the complication increases a lot.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.320
For those outside, for those

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.120
outside, say, for competitors

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.740
it is very complicated and for

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.380
those inside, the current

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.540
software manufacturers benefit

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.620
a lot.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.220
Another common entry barrier is

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.900
that you have preferential access

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.200
to the resources that are needed

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.700
to compete.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.300
And here we are talking about very

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.940
different cases, because I can put

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.300
the case that you have access to

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.440
natural resources.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.260
For example, a Saudi oil

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.980
company with good relations

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.080
with the government.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.100
You have access to resources

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.780
that your competitors or potential

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.320
competitors do not have.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.300
But let’s not go to such examples,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.160
we can go to closer things.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.800
If you have, as we saw in the

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.980
case of Infinite Finders, at

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.660
the time you have a gym, that you

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.500
have a profitable gym in a given

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.880
location, in a neighborhood,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.000
because you are discouraging the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.780
entry of potential competitors.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.280
That creates a certain barrier

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.600
to entry, because they

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.660
won’t venture to ride a

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.840
gym near your own.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.520
When you have the resource

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.680
located, when you have the location,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.900
at that point you are protecting

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.900
your business.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.900
Another common entry barrier

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.100
is patents.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.800
When you have a patent, your

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.680
business is protected for a while.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.740
And there are companies that have been

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.040
able to exploit this, such as Tetra Pak

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.100
with the patent of the Tetra

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.960
Brick, which has been one of the most

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.980
profitable in history.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.800
And there are industries that

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.160
are really like the pharmaceutical

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.040
industry, which are almost

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.900
organized around this.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.920
That is, why invest hundreds

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.360
of millions in R&D, permanent,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.540
etc.? to

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.740
Well, because when they are

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.880
able to create profitable

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.980
patents, their business,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.200
as we say, is protected for a

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.860
long time.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.580
They are able to have a high

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.740
return on those R&D investments, mainly

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.900
because of this, mainly

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.560
because of the protection it

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.760
implies.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.400
If their weren’t protected,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.100
they’d probably not invest

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.440
so much, because they won’

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.080
t get that return.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.360
The last one we will look at is

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.220
legal protection.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.780
Legal protection is also given in

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.740
very different ways.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.460
It can be given on a small scale,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.820
for example, in local that

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.140
need a license.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.900
The pharmacy business in Spain

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.960
is protected by, why? for

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.240
the simple reason that you

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.060
can not freely open a pharmacy.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.420
This means that the profitability within

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.780
the sector increases considerably.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.300
Imagine changing the legislation.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.040
Imagine that the large food distribution

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.880
in the supermarkets, etc.,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.340
could sell medicines.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.500
Anyone can build a pharmacy.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.140


00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.300
At that time, the profits would

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.240
fall to the pharmacies.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.800
Well, the profits, I don’t know,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.660
would fall mainly in sales.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.620
Because your business would let you be protected.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.780
They would lose that entry barrier

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.860
they have, which is one of

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.520
the valuants for profitability they get.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.220
Another form of protection

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.720
is protectionism, let us

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.620
say protectionism.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.780
There are countries where

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.160
local competitors benefit

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.500
from certain conditions

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.060
than foreigners do.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.280
This is a barrier

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.100
to entry.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.700
Well, to finish I want you to

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.600
be in the sector you are always

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.820
thinking about entry barriers

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.180
and thinking about how you generate

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.940
those entry barriers.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.060
How to protect your business

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.420
against competitors.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.280
This will be one of the key factors

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.440
that will determine sustained

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.600
profitability in the medium term.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.060
There are many mechanisms

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.560
that create barriers to entry.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.160
Some are not available to

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.580
everyone.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.580
Not everyone can build a super

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.660
powerful brand, a worldwide

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.680
love brand.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.040
But on a small scale, yes,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.920
on a small scale, we can all

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920
think of entry barriers.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.320
We can all think about

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.540
identifying mechanisms that

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.680
protect our business.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.160
Establish relationships exclusively

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.400
with suppliers that may generate

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.380
a competitive advantage

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.500
in the market.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.440
Establish relationships with distribution

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.680
channels, with partners that position

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.240
us better than others and

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.520
that protect our business.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.200
Well, there are many possibilities.
