WEBVTT

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.610
We will talk about segmentation.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.810


00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.290
I think it is interesting

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.610
that we go into depth in this

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.790
type of segmentation because it

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.510
is growing very much and it brings

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.210
huge benefits to companies.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.740
I remember the concept.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.780
What is segmentation by behavior?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.640
It consists of identifying

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.180
segments within our current

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.240
customers or our potential

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.900
customers based on their behavior

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.780
as customers, that is, based

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.980
on their relationship

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.260
with us.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.040
There are many possibilities

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.480
to segment.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.620
We can segment according to

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.620
how much money they are generating,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.480
when is the last time they bought,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.260
how often they buy, what

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
products they bought,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.860
etc.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.440
There are thousands of possibilities.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.820
What I want today is that you understand

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.560
why this is growing so much and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.340
let’s look at some examples that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820
help you visualize how it is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.300
used in the day-to-day practice.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.620
Behavioral segmentation,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.300
what is it that allows us or what

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.940
benefits it generates?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.820
Basically what allows us to know

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.020
what works because what we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.060
do is look back at the past,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.320
analyze our customers’ relationships

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.000
with us and see what works

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.700
or what doesn’t work.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.900
And when you know what works and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.020
what doesn’t, the next thing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.460
you can do is optimize it.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.320
Optimize in what direction?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.400
Well, because we can sell more,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.400
we can improve the capture campaigns,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.340
etc.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.560
Why is?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.820
We will adapt to each

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.020
customer better.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.060
If we made a stream of how this

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.160
works, it would basically

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.140
be like that.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.420
The first thing you need to do is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.320
be able to get the information.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.180
You have in mind that you generate

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.780
endless or thousands or millions

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.880
of interactions with customers

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.740
every day.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.240
And if we want to segment according

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.420
to those interactions, we have to be

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.640
able to measure them and from that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.920
information what we do is identify

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.460
segments, which as we will see there

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.560
are many possibilities and in the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560
end this serves us to adapt

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.920
the proposals.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.100
That is, if we have identified a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.520
segment that is dissatisfied with

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.740
us, for example, because what we

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.720
have to do is a proposal adapted

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280
to manage that complaint.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.360
Imagine, I will just give you an example.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.220
And we go to the first of the blocks

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.520
that is to obtain the information.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.040
Well, here I want you to know that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.240
the key that companies are increasingly

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.900
using behavioral segmentation

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
is that we are increasingly

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.160
able to measure absolutely

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.540
everything that happens

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.800
to customers.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480
And this is primarily or more

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.340
often done in companies

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.000
that we have a relationship

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.980
through our potential customers.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.000
The tools are increasing,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.220
the tools we can use

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.400
to measure or manage that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.760
footprint that is generated

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.760
every day.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.640
Traditionally companies have used

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.880
software such as CRM or RP in

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.780
which, well, as I said, it is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.140
creating the footprint of

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.300
what is being generated, but

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.300
it is now all smaller companies

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.860
have access to software.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.660
Imagine an e-commerce, because

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.260
it has the tool, a tool like

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.460
Shopify, for example, because

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.140
it generates a lot of information

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.100
because they are prepared

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.460
for this, they are prepared

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.540
so that you can manage

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.600
that information.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.500
Or if you use a marketing automation

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
tool like Active Campaign, for example,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.780
because you can configure it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.160
so that it measures absolutely

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.700
everything and in a personalized

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.160
way of each customer.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.060
Or if you use Mailchimp, which

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.700
is used by millions of companies

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.480
around the world, it is a software

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.680
to send emailings.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.220
Mailchimp tells you how many

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.960
people have opened emails, how

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.460
many have opened emails, and so on.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.580
by Hotjar.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.820
Hotjar is a web analytics tool

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.260
that, for example, among other

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.320
things, allows you to generate

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.660
what we have on screen,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.240
in which you are seeing

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.580
what customers do on your

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.780
website, but it is that

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.120
you could see for each of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.880
the customers.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.800
Well, what I want you to stay

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.820
with is that we have more and more

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.000
information and therefore, we

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.740
can segment more and more precisely

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.340
and adapt more, to the point

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.100
that we can segment already

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.460
for each person.
