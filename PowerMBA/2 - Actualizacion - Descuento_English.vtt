00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.730
To understand the discount of cash

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.790
flows, or discount of cash

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.910
flows, I want to go

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.890
deeper into the concept of

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.490
discounting or updating,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.890
which we saw in previous classes.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.050
Well, discounting or updating is calculating

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.670
the value today, the present value,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.890
the current value of a cash

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.690
flow, of a charge, of a payment

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.610
that occurs in the periods.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.230
And what we do is bring it to the present

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.930
moment to see how much it is worth

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.570
today.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.930
As we have seen, we have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.230
to consider the value of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.150
money in time.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.710
One million euros in five years.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.890
How much is it worth today?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.470
We are trying to discount

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.370
that million.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.810
And how do we do it?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.650
The formula is this.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.430
The present value or current

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.030
value is equal to that cash flow

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.390
divided to bring it, to discount

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.910
it, to update it, we divide it between

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
an upgrade or discount factor,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.630
which is equal to one plus

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.850
the interest rate raised

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.130
to n, which is the number

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.250
of periods.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.710
By the way, here I want you to keep

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.250
in mind that here we’ve

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070
talked about interest rate I,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.030
but really this is the upgrade

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.990
rate or it’s the discount rate.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.110
And sometimes you’ll see it written,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.910
for example, with the letter K, or with the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.670
letter D.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.550
Well, it depends on the context in which

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.510
it is used, but I want you to understand it.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.290
It is the upgrade rate, it is the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.610
discount rate we will use to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.150
divide that future cash flow and

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.190
bring it to the current moment.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.310
Well, let’s see an example.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.270
We will think that in this case the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510
discount rate or interest rate

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.290
is 10% and that we want to discount

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.290
200,000 euros that we will charge,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.530
for example, in this case it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.050
is a charge within three years

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.590
and we bring it at the current time.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.450
We use the formula.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.150
We have 200,000 between 1 plus

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.710
10% elevated to 3.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430
Well, in the end we are dividing 200,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.030
000 between 1 by 33.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.930
And from this formula what we get is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990
that the current value or present

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.890
value of those 200,000 euros

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.030
when we bring them to date is equal

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.130
to 150.263.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.430
So, what does this depend on?

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.150
What is the current value of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.190
a future cash flow?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.770
It depends on, as we are seeing in

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.610
the formula, the variables are the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.170
discount rate and the number of periods.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.250
What happens if, for example,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.850
we increase the discount rate

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.970
and we double the discount rate?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.730
This is a $20,000 discount, but in this

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.450
case we will be discounted at 20% instead

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.370
of 10%.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.950
Well, as you can see, it is very clear

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.770
in the formula because it is in the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.430
denominator.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.290
We are dividing by a larger

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.190
amount.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.230
So in this case the current

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.870
value, which was 150,000 euros

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.410
before, in this case are 115,741.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.910
If we increase the discount

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.270
rate, if we discount at a higher

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.050
rate, the current value is lower.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.730
It is quite logical.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.530
You probably already know what

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.710
it means to update or discount.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.470
We have seen the example with

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.430
a single amount.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.650
We calculated what the current

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.090
value of 200,000 euros we will receive

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.170
within three years and we discounted

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.790
them with two discount rates,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.550
which were with 10 and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.890
20%.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.330
Well, the discount of cash

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.050
flows is ultimately the same.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.530
What happens is that in this case

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.810
we will apply it to a series

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.710
of cash flows or a series of cash

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.470
flows, but we will do the same.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.750
We will bring them all to the current

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.430
moment and we will calculate the current

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.270
value or present value of that flow

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.370
of Today we make an investment of

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.270
500,000 euros, which is a

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.650
cash output and we have a series

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.310
of positive cash flows

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.950
entries in the next four years,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.150
of 200.000 euros each.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.230
But look, we could put

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.590
different amounts.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.890
We will be counting the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.450
cash flow.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.050
Let’s calculate how much all those

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.650
future cash flows are worth today,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.470
taking into account the value

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.310
of money over time.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.090
And how do we do it?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.750
What we’re going to do is calculate

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.430
the cash flow and bring it

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.650
to the current moment.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.870
We will bring the 200,000 euros of the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.530
year 4, we will discount them and we will

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.310
calculate how much they are worth today.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.950
And we will add the current value

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.110
of the 200,000 euros we will receive

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.390
within three years, two years,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.270
a year, etc.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.310
We will add it all and we will

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.670
calculate what the current value

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.810
of all those future cash

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.910
flows will be.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.450
What is the formula for this?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.290
very simple though.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.610
It is the same as the one

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.530
we have studied the discount, the update.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.150
What happens is that in this case

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.870
we will add the different cash

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.510
flows so easily.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.510
Let’s look at this example, let’s

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.610
see it with a little more of detail

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.830
at a numerical level.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.610
We have cash flows that are the investment

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.730
of 500,000 and then the charges

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.730
we receive in the next

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.110
four years.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.330
Here is the formula.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.570
As you can see the discount formula

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.390
for cash flows, what we do is

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.470
bring those cash flows or discount

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.070
them all to the current moment

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.650
with a discount factor applying

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.250
a discount factor or an

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.050
upgrade factor.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.310
This is 10% of what

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.310
we have said.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.390
In the first case, we will

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.090
divide that investment, the investment,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.830
those 500,000 euros we will

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.170
divide by a discount factor.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.130
In this case, the rate is

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.850
up to zero.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.030
That is, it’s equal to one,

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.190
mathematically it’s equal to

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.230
one but good common sense

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.430
also tells you because it’s an

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.250
investment that we make today.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.370
If you do today the factor, the

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.150
value of money in time does not affect.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.270
As we move forward, we

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.770
will divide by a larger

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.590
amount.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.370
Divide by 1 with 1 elevated

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.150
to 1.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.210
We divide between 1 and 1.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.970
If we go to the year 2, we

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.650
will divide those 200,000 euros

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.230
by a discount factor that

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.830
is 1 with 1 elevated to 2

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.510
that is equal to 1 with

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.170
21.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.550
The current value of those 200,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.610
000 euros when divided between 1

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.410
and 21 is 123,000.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.810
We can do this every

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.910
year, with all the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.370
cash flow.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.950
If we add the discounted cash

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.750
flows of all periods what we

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.750
have is the current value or

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.050
present value of that cash

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.970
flow.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.730
That is, cash flow discount allows

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.670
us to calculate the present value or

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.950
current value of a series of cash

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.770
flows that will be levies and payments

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.430
that are given in the future.
