00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.330
How do you give it form?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.090
Because there are many people who

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.390
have an idea, more now in this area

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.590
that has passed crisis, where people

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.790
did not find work and have developed

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.710
more entrepreneurial activity,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.130
and there are people who

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.270
do not know how to start.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.790
How did you start?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.190
The easiest thing is to summarize the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.710
story and how it arises.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.310
I had a friend named De Jemi,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.470
who was in the United States

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.930
studying, and seeing how Facebook

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.930
was beginning to catch some

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.870
critical mass.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.890
It was a very small one, with between

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.130
5 and 10,000 users.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.650
Today it has billions, you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.490
can imagine the vision that the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.590
uncle had at the time.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.710
He got a call from her one day and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.150
said, “Hey, Felix, why don’t we

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.990
put this story together, that

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.310
I think it can be very interesting

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.390
and we can make it a big deal?”

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.630
I didn’t understand it, I saw it

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.350
as a website, I didn’t even know

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.270
how we would make it profitable,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.730
but it sounded funny and,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.270
above all, he was a very skilled

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.150
person with very good educational

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.310
training and, above all,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890
then, professional.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.030
Then I trusted him, and he introduced

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.350
me to another person who was supposed

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.110
to be the one who was going to develop

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.150
the entire technological part,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030
which also fell very well to me

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.270
and it seemed that we understood

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730
each other, and we started

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.550
the project.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.870
From there, it was all a bit

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.970
to see what pieces we needed

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.670
to build it, on the one hand, obviously,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.550
the whole part of engineering, on

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.950
the other hand, the whole part

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.150
of marketing, on the other hand,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.030
the whole part of financing, which

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.210
was initially the one that cost

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.990
us the most, because we were

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.790
leaving the university,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.870
we did not have much knowledge

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.850
and we did not know how

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.470
to start.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.930
So we looked for the way we could

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.150
finance it between ourselves

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.450
at first, obviously we had

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.190
the luck that at the time the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.050
banks were lending us money because

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.330
our parents supported us for

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.710
it and we could raise a little

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.250
money, we raised, I think

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.190
it was 60 to 80,000

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.450
euros between the three.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.270
I believe that you proposed to enter me

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.530
at that time in that project and it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.430
seemed to me that I did not understand

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.670
anything about what you were talking to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.570
me and I did not enter, and look you where.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.690
Well, I think everyone sold

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.810
it like you, the problem

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.890
is that not even I knew where

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.630
we were going, not even knew

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.050
how to sell it, not even knew

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.250
how we would make a profit,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.950
but it was a beautiful story,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.510
one of our very chulas, I was

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.170
ending the career and also

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.210
had to do a career end project

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.450
for one of our professors,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.350
so I could fit very well

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.690
with this subject project

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.830
we had.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.330
Then, we started and obviously what

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.710
we did first was to create a business

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.690
plan in which we showed how we

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.150
were going to make money with this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.790
project, that the truth that this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.590
model did my friend Adeyemi and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.190
was a very basic model, was hearing,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.130
look if we have so many users and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.850
generate so many pages viewed

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.490
and we sell the impression

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.590
of the ad to so much, because

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.470
according to the amount of users

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.070
and traffic we had, because

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.650
we could generate so many...

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.430
That is, it was a model based on

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.330
advertising pay.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.990
As is.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.830
The user would never be costly.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.210
Very basic, at the time, we are talking

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.010
about 10-12 years ago, when the only

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.430
thing that was CPM, very classic

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.970
formats and there was also, as if

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.430
we said, there was not much trajectory

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.550
already in that sense and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.790
the Internet was practically

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.990
being born.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.310
So with that model, we said,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.750
hear, let’s see if we are able

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.810
to seek funding.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.730
The first 60,000 euros we

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.550
put them and obviously they burned

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.890
relatively quickly and once

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.970
our own money had already

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.110
ended, because we went

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.210
out to look for capital.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.410
How are you facing?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.690
You never raised money, more

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.990
than your friends.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.150
In fact, our end was a bit lucky

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.350
because Adeyemi at college

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.770
had a partner in whom his father

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.770
had created a company called

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.610
NetJuice, which is

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.030
a company that they sold

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.870
to Yahoo.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.730
And it was a long time before

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.250
we went out to the market

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.750
to find funding.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.250
So the first thing he said to us was,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.350
“Hey, why don’t you go and talk

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.230
to my friend’s father?”

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.330
Maybe he understands this.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.870
And effectively, we went to talk

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.470
to his friend’s father and we

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.250
told him and at 30 minutes he

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.170
said he put a check of 300,000

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.350
euros on the table.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.590
It was quite surprising,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.010
but it was very easy, it

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.670
was much easier than

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.090
we thought at the time.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.010
And then, once we had that check

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.790
on the table, one of the university

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.690
professors, from Adeyemi

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.830
too, had had a successful

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.410
case, or well, was starting

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.710
a successful case that was

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.890
Alista, who was Bernardo

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.990
Hernández.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.550
Then, he said, I’ll contact you

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.750
with Bernardo and tell him

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.570
about the movie.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.450
We went to tell Bernardo the project

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.270
and immediately saw it.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.110
He also invested in us.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.830
Then, from there, we gathered

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.350
the first 500,000 euros and

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.370
it was with them that we

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.930
continued to develop the entire project.
