00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
And finally, could you briefly explain to us what are the benefits, and thinking perhaps,

00:09.840 --> 00:15.080
can you give us an example of recent cases and known by all, what are the benefits of

00:15.080 --> 00:24.840
how you have helped through this mechanism to reach a higher dimension, a startup?

00:24.840 --> 00:31.840
Well, we thought, and now I'm going to talk about television directly, more than offline

00:31.840 --> 00:32.840
in general.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.840
Although it may seem surprising among all the people who move in the digital world,

00:36.840 --> 00:42.840
who usually have the mentality that they are breakers and they leave the traditional paradigm

00:42.840 --> 00:47.840
and are very open-minded, the big challenge we have is, we collide with these people because

00:47.840 --> 00:51.840
they have assimilated too much the digital paradigm and do not know how to get out of there with

00:51.840 --> 00:56.840
the traditional formula of the cost of channel acquisition, direct, immediate, in the second.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.840
That is, how hard it is for me to adapt with Google, how hard it is for me to adapt with

00:59.840 --> 01:01.840
Facebook, and that is the absolute truth.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.840
So, the first big challenge we have normally when we talk to online businesses is to break

01:07.840 --> 01:11.840
that psychological barrier, because really, at a certain point, in a first phase, that

01:11.840 --> 01:13.840
is perfect.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.840
It is true that this notion must never be lost, the cost of acquisition in Brazil is

01:17.840 --> 01:25.840
a huge problem, but thinking that only online marketing will solve all the problems is

01:25.840 --> 01:29.840
stupid, and thinking that the solution to all the problems is a direct cost of acquisition

01:29.840 --> 01:31.840
in the immediate, is stupid.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Why?

01:32.840 --> 01:37.840
Because you are losing many other things and many other advantages that offline will give you.

01:37.840 --> 01:45.840
And I'm not talking about branding as intangible, do not look at it, do not measure it, do not

01:45.840 --> 01:47.840
measure it because it is intangible, no.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.840
Branding is really the big prize.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
Why?

01:51.840 --> 01:57.840
Because the brand is supposed to lose its dependence on Google, which means that you are able to

01:57.840 --> 02:04.840
achieve organic growth by losing, having to put money in Google or other online media

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
continuously.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.840
What the brand allows you, or what television allows you, is credibility.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.840
Credibility improves conversion rates, which is also tangible.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.840
But of course, this must be measured once you have finished a television campaign.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.840
Once you have finished a television campaign, you measure the different metrics and you see

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
where your impact is.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.840
What impact are you going to see?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.840
You are going to see that you are going to have the next organic traffic.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.840
You are going to see that you have scaled.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.840
As you have scaled, you are more relevant in the market with respect to your suppliers or

02:33.840 --> 02:37.840
with respect to your users.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.840
You are going to have better conversion rates because you have credibility.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.840
You are going to have a better grasp of the supply side.

02:44.840 --> 02:49.840
Many times in an e-commerce, you have a relationship with the suppliers, so that relationship improves

02:49.840 --> 02:53.840
and allows you to be more competitive with a better product, but in a marketplace, it

02:53.840 --> 02:57.840
builds and offers you and sends you in parallel and brings liquidity to the market.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.840
In addition to giving you credibility, so these are the two keys of a marketplace.

03:02.840 --> 03:10.840
What it is also going to give you is that scale that allows you to accelerate that positioning process

03:10.840 --> 03:15.840
in such a way that you can lead the market with television.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.840
At Venture Capital, we all look for an attractive success.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.840
An attractive success comes from being the market leader.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.840
The market leader is valid, the third in the market is not.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.840
So, if you are able to achieve market leadership, if you are able to achieve organic traffic,

03:30.840 --> 03:38.840
a top of mind, you have generated a barrier to entry.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.840
In a case like the red fridge, taking it to a case, maybe it is the case that has been

03:44.840 --> 03:49.840
the most known, it is not the only one, because we have had very interesting cases, but where

03:49.840 --> 03:51.840
has the red fridge affected it?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.840
What has been the experience of television with them?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.840
They come to us following interesting growth rates, but obviously,

03:57.840 --> 04:02.840
growth in the offline world reaches a point where they are decreasing, but they want to

04:02.840 --> 04:05.840
maintain that strong growth rate month after month.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.840
So, at a point in which television starts to be tested, and you change the line and

04:10.840 --> 04:12.840
grow it again.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.840
First advantage, before making television, it was very difficult to capture restaurants,

04:16.840 --> 04:19.840
after making television, the restaurants call you.

04:19.840 --> 04:25.840
So, what you are doing is generating a much more attractive offer for the user.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.840
So, that should improve the growth rates as well.

04:28.840 --> 04:34.840
Second, television brings them significant traffic peaks, especially in this case,

04:34.840 --> 04:39.840
as we put ads at 9pm, which is a hungry hour, people were peaking over and over again.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.840
So, what do you achieve as well?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.840
For example, cohorts improve.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.840
Cohorts usually improve by 20% or 30% with television.

04:49.840 --> 04:55.840
That means that i am improving the consumption of my historical users.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.840
Those who had me before television consume me more now than before.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.840
So, that keeps improving my acquisition cost, because in the end,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.840
my lifetime value, because the recurrence improves.

05:06.840 --> 05:12.840
In the case of the red fridge, we have studied how the network effects affect a marketplace.

05:12.840 --> 05:17.840
So, in this case, television, what you helped so much was to add mass on both sides.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
Of course.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.840
That gives you liquidity, mass, that brings organic traffic.

05:22.840 --> 05:27.840
And then, the most interesting thing about the red fridge is, what do we achieve?

05:27.840 --> 05:31.840
We manage to position the red fridge as the market leader, along with Justit.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.840
Both grew exponentially, and there came a time when it created a barrier to entry.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.840
No one else can enter the Spanish sector.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.840
There are already two players, and there is no room for anyone else.

05:40.840 --> 05:46.840
So, at a time when the sector was consolidating globally,

05:46.840 --> 05:51.840
which was a proven model, and where there were 4 or 5 international players

05:51.840 --> 05:54.840
who were fighting to be the global leader in an acquisitive way,

05:54.840 --> 05:58.840
you enter a process in which anyone, if they want to enter Spain,

05:58.840 --> 06:01.840
has only one alternative, to buy the red fridge, or buy Justit,

06:01.840 --> 06:02.840
which was one of the global leaders.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.840
So, Justit, if it has to consolidate, has to buy the red fridge.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.840
And if not, everyone else has to compete for the red fridge.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.840
So, you already generate a competitive process, and since you have created an entry barrier,

06:13.840 --> 06:16.840
you have created a top of mind, and you have created a brand,

06:16.840 --> 06:18.840
you can maximize the sales price.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.840
So, it is all related.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.840
If Justit is here, I am here.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.840
There is no entry barrier, anyone can enter.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.840
Anyone will be able to reach a...

06:32.840 --> 06:38.840
Delivery Hero can launch the initiative from scratch and start building.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.840
So, this concept of top of mind, organic traffic,

06:43.840 --> 06:47.840
in real terms, is what makes the difference,

06:47.840 --> 06:49.840
and what makes you the market winner.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.840
That's right.
