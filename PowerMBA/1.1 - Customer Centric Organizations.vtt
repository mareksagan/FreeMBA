00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.330
Now that you understand the benefits

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.190
of becoming a customer-centered

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.970
organization, the next question

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.330
is, well, but, and what

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.050
to do?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.110
Because this is very difficult.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.230
In fact, there are very

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
few organizations that have really

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.430
implanted these principles

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.770
in their DNA, in their systems,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.330
in their operations, in the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.990
metrics, very few.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
Well, what we're going to see today is

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.350
to understand what the leverage is, to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.250
have that vision.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.830
Then what we will have to do

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.610
is go into detail on each

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.270
of them.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.590
I have shared it with my hand

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.330
and hand.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.090
The first of them is, and the most

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.170
important, I would say, where it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.850
all starts, is that we have to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.550
understand our customers very well.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.810
To know is not to know.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.250
Knowing is knowing who they are.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.670
Understanding goes far beyond.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.010
We need to know what problems they

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.170
have, how they think, how they

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.530
are, how we can help them, etc.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.150
This knowledge is very valuable.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.050
And what we're going to do is,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.910
we'll learn to segment, we'

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.770
ll learn to make a customer

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.450
person, we'll learn

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.850
to use the patilla map, etc.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.810
Any effort we make to understand

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.210
our customers will be little.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.850


00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.510
This is really different in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.270
any business.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.590
What we're going to do is, we're

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.910
going to live the customer's experience

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.410
from their shoes, from their

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.450
point of view.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
We will live the journey of the customer.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.950
Why is it?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.330
This will allow us to create

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.650
better experiences.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.350
We know him, we know how he is,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.110
we know how he thinks, we know

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.190
what keys to play.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.190
And what we're going to do is now

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.390
analyze how you feel when

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030
you have an interaction with

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.810
us, the customer journey.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.730
Well, all this, all this is very nice,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.230
but I tell you that then it is very

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.330
difficult to manage.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.970
It is very difficult.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.430
Why is it?

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510
Because you have in mind that you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.910
usually have hundreds or thousands

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.850
or millions of customers, there are

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.930
dozens of touch points, a lot of information

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.850
is generated and this is very

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.030
difficult to manage.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.290
So what we need to do is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.150
to implement the right systems.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.710
The appropriate systems to measure

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.490
each of those interactions and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.230
to manage the relationship with

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.610
the customer.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.230
And what we will do is, we will

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.210
study the methodology or philosophy

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.650
of customer relationship

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.650
management, of CRM, which is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.370
not just a technology, but

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.990
is a way of managing customers.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.130


00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.270
Each company will have to have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.630
different systems.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.710
There are more and more tools that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.350
allow us to permanently measure

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.730
what happens to customers, we will see.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.970
Another important key is

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.730
the metric.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.030
You have in mind that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.470
organizations usually set metrics

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.390
that are related to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.690
their business goals, which

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.230
depending on the company,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.530
but basically usually

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.750
sales, increase Think

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.750
of the metrics you have

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.530
named, sales, profits.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.050
Where is the customer here?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.410
The customer here is a means

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.250
to this.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.870
What we have to do is use metrics

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.490
that are related to the value

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.510
we are generating to the customer,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.370
with better knowing the customer,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.730
with better understanding

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.530
him.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.670
Which will we use?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.290
We will use metrics that are not

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.670
aggregated metrics, but are

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.530
metrics per customer.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.150
And finally, we already understand

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.970
our customers, we have designed an

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.490
experience because we are able

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.250
to live the customer relationship

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.730
from their point of view, we have

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.590
the systems that allow us to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.670
measure, in addition we have

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.490
incorporated metrics that naturally

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.730
orient us to be a more customer-

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.430
centric company, but the last thing

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.310
to do, which is basic, is that

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.030
the whole organization

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.710
creates it to you in this.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.910
And the whole organization is

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.410
talking to you from the management

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.590
to absolutely every department,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.010
the whole team.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.210
Culture must be changed.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.290
Another way to do this is to identify

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.370
those metrics that we have identified,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.230
that we have incorporated,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.550
to encourage the organization with

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.450
those metrics, that people do

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.650
not measure by sales, etc., that

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.770
everyone has those metrics

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.770
in their heads.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.950
In addition, your salary

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.350
is conditioned on metrics that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.290
are representative of the customer

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.810
experience or the customer'

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.490
s value much better.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.430
This latter is not easy, that is,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.090
aligning the organization is very

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.570
complicated, because usually partners

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.210
or managers are thinking about

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.110
the budget, are thinking

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.330
about sales, are thinking

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.510
about their bonus, etc.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.110
And if we go down, the teams,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.770
what the intermediate command

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.930
or people below really do

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.250
in what you are thinking

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.610
is in the work they have assigned

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.630
that day.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.310
And that's your productivity measures

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.950
it so and in the end what happens

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.470
is that everyone, the entire

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.270
organization, seems to be getting

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.270
too far away from the customer.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.970
This is the last of the challenges,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.750
but it is absolutely basic.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.450
The organization has to have in the

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.170
decision that the customer makes.
