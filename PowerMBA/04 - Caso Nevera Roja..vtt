00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.660
All this comes about in 2009

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.020
working in consulting.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.040
Both my co-founder Iñigo and I were

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.460
working on the strategy part of

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.740
a consultancy and gave the chance

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.140
that I did two projects in

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.600
consultancy, one related to

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.320
the internet and another related

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.920
to the Food Home, of a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.000
company that was going out

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
to the stock market at that time.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.180
I was trying to go out of stock, then

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.140
it didn't go out and well, the result

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.380
of the analysis of what we saw, in

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.500
this case I was analyzing that the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.700
online channel of the Food

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.940
Home, in particular in Spain,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.140
was working very well and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.020
was taking off.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.460
On the other hand, as consultants

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.240
we worked until the night and we

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.200
asked in general also to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.440
the Home Food and we always

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.600
asked at the end to the same

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.920
and it was a super dull

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.820
process by phone, etc.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.920
So we were going to combine both

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.280
things and we said, heh, there is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.860
no way to add all the restaurants

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.940
in the city on a web platform

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.160
that allows you to place

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.740
orders conveniently, quickly,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.740
etc.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.420
Then we believed at that moment,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.720
I shared it with Iñigo, Iñigo

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.920
liked the idea a lot and we

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.680
believed at that moment it was

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.300
an idea that no one in the world

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.320
had ever heard of and after

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.340
devoting him four hours to analyze

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340
it we realized that this was

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.280
more than invented, it was

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.400
now nine years running

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.020
this type of platforms.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.700
The oldest was probably Just Eat

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
in Denmark, which at the time

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.840
was very, that is, at first it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.320
was Denmark, very small form, which

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.340
then over the years, after the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.820
years went to London and that'

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.080
s where it really took off.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.620
There were platforms like this in

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.560
the United States as well.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.740
So, well, that was good and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.160
bad news.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.040
On the one hand, it was worth giving you the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.980
business model, on the other hand, I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.120
said, you hear, because at some point they

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.680
will come to Spain and it will be more complicated.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.340
Then we started to release it while

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.360
we were working at Price and after

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.440
a year and peak, we saw that Just

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.020
Eat was coming to Spain.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.180
I remember perfectly that, more

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.100
at that time, I just got married

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.020
at the party and we

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.340
talked to a person.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.240
We get the rice, the train

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.100
goes, we have to jump.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.520


00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.780
This was in September and we were

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.100
still doubting a little more and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.220
in December we jumped, December

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.840
2010, January 2011.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.380
And that's where the story began, which

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.500
is a story that lasted exactly four years.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.960
In fact, it is very strange.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.860
And the company started four years

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.200
later, the day before or the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.180
day after my birthday.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.840
It was funny, I always

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.300
told him.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.860
It was a very quick story.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.440
Four years is really a short

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.680
time for a company like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.080
this.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.200
And really from operation to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.280
operation, with revenue and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.620
running, it was in 40 months,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.190
from September 2011 to January 2015.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.210
At that time we were about sixty

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.410
people in the team, twenty thousand

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.990
people of technology

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.750
and product.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.630
On the platform we had, I already

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.890
dance the figures, but a little

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.170
more than half a million users

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.390
and we generated restaurants

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.550
around 35-40 million euros annually,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.870
growing at an annual rate

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.530
of around 300%.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.400
We had a great brand recognition

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.620
and we were, from the point of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.260
view of brand recognition and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.860
value generation to restaurants,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.820
leaders in Spain, despite fighting

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.240
against the leader of Just

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.520
Eat, who had already raised

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.700
about 200 million euros,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.920
had gone to the stock

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.660
exchange, etc.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.660
And at that time, for different

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.260
reasons, we were talking to

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.900
different competitors who

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.780
wanted to buy us.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.180
We said no several times and

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.320
came a time when it became obvious

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.320
that we had to at least assemble

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.020
a process and see what value

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.520
the market found in our

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.980
business.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.300
We started that process and in about

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.780
two or three months there were up to

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.660
four or five interested in buying the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.260
company, a auction was generated,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.980
the price was raised and in the end

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.000
the valuation was good and in the end

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
since January 2015 we sold the company.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.340
I stayed for a few months helping with

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.680
the transition and then decided

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.540
to set up the fund I am telling you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.380
now, which is called Samaipata

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.060
Ventures, which is a fund

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.400
specialized in marketplaces in

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.740
southern Europe.
