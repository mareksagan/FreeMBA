00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.960
What are, in your opinion, the

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.100
main milestones in the development

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.200
of a startup, from the point of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.780
view of the growth phases and, above

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.460
all, of the financing that should

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.780
go alongside those phases?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.240
I think there must be a balance

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.420
between the natural growth

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.260
of the product and the financing

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.980
rounds.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.860
I think if the funding grows too

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.640
fast you are creating a little

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.600
bubble effect, where you have probably

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.140
sold too much the project with

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.220
the value you are demonstrating and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.260
if you are going to be able to...

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.400
Do you have any example of that?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Well, yes, there have been in

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.640
the United States a couple of apps

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.520
that I have met very closely,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.980
Secret, which I liked a lot, which

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.540
was like an anonymous Twitter with

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.920
a component grew a lot, but the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.320
funding grew even faster and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.040
they made rounds where they

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840
raised $40 million without

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.460
being justified and without being

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.880
the company ready to digest

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.040
them and broke the year.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.400
What usually happens?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.900
Like all the bubbles.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.420
Because in principle having more

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.960
money't have to be a bad thing,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.240
right?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.040
No, but when that money gets

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.820
it, not anchored to real value

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.380
and solid pillars, but as an

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.520
excessive effect of perception

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.500
and sale of the project,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.440
because in the end that has pernicious

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.820
consequences derived from

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960
that excess by which the money

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.580
has been captured.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.040
It is not anchored and then

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.180
it begins to invest money where

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.280
it should not, to grow very artificially.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.920
Marketing is probably one of the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.540
most dangerous demons of startups,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.040
where with relatively

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.560
little money you can create

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.540
a very powerful use of artificiality.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.760


00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.120
By having money, because not,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.200
we can grow without actually validating

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.740
the model, without actually

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.600
dealing with the application

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.260
and the tool.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.760
It is just an example.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840
When there are a lot of resources and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800
you are not prepared to invest them

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.080
and manage them, because in the end

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.140
you are making a lot of mistakes.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.320
In marketing, in team recruitment,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.660
in the evolution of the strategy.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.900
I think it is as dangerous not

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.980
to raise money and not to

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.480
have enough money as to be able

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.440
to run, as to raise too much money.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.940
I have seen examples of both.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.280
I think he has to be accompanied.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.380
When you see it, it is very easy.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.180
It is very easy.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.080
Rounds are done very quickly,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.660
very easily.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.600
Investors are usually accompanied

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.340
when there is an obvious

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.360
balance between the price you

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.280
are putting on them and the value

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.540
you are creating.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.860
We call what you say

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.200
a premature escalation.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.700
It's when you really haven't validated

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.220
the model and you're doing

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.620
it almost artificially,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.420
because you're growing in users

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.680
but don't retain it, the chance

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.820
rate is very high or you're not

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.580
monetizing it.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.520
But of course, as you're growing

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.320
in users, the hype is huge.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.180
But it is that today even retention

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.680
can be brought through marketing.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.940
You can measure when a user has allowed

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.180
you to log in in a month and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.520
place a Facebook ad to them in

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.240
30 days.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.660
You can make fisting until retention.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.100
Marketing is dangerous.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.980
It's so sophisticated that you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.800
can actually get packaging

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.080
or whatever behind marketing.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.540
And if you don't do it well, if

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.080
you don't do it to accelerate a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.980
product that's already accelerating

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.040
and is growing well, you're

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.220
eventually creating a core of potential

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.040
problems that usually

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.800
end up ending the project.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.320
And I have seen it.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.380
Unfortunately, when you are in this

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.880
world you see the things of success

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.840
as we have talked about before,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.820
but also the failures that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.260
are many more by rule of play.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.860
So, all these things I have seen,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.760
I am seeing them.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.780
What would the phases be like

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.940
if we thought from birth?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.540
Do you have an idea, you with a friend,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520
whatever, start to undertake?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.960
What would these growth phases

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.980
be like, but from the point of

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.700
view of financing?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.740
The first thing you do is maybe

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.040
put your money or ask for money from

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.940
close people, you start to grow.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.040
We have said there must be a balance,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.600
but how would that process be?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.120
Who do you go to, I mean, how much

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.880
money, how long?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.820
First you have to make a plan of how

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.340
much you need and what you will

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.980
do with that money.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.260
When you ask for money, you have

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.600
to say what you will do with that money.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.940
I would try to get enough money

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.000
for at least 18 months.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.060
of the first.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.120
First, at least for 18 months that

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.160
will give you time to iterate, to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.440
iterate until you get a MVP.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.600
And then I would go to that, we

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.940
enter 18 months until we get to

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.700
break even freedom or a growth

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.040
fund for maybe three or four years.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.760
But I think

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.260
that sequence is very important.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.900
That is, we start, the idea is

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.860
born, we make money for 18 months

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.140
to be able to iterate until

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.160
you get to product market fit, have

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.640
a minimum viable product, that

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.640
the market is showing you that people

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.580
want you, that you buy it,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.460
that you are earning money, etc.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.660
Do you raise money again?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.960
You are raising money again with that

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.800
market fit, without your eye being wiped

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.000
out in valuations and there in that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.020
second phase you are going to grow.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.900
Are the channels worth

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.860
marketing?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.020
It depends, for example, in the listed

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.020
run there was no need to face

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.760
that round and we came to break even

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.680
and the cash generated by the

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.840
company, finance and social growth.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.420
And if not, because there are

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.400
more and more growth funds that

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.080
enter very late phases and where

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.180
the multiple is smaller, the risk

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.320
is also smaller and the amounts

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.360
needed are larger.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.380
Then they go for checks of 10, 20,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.620
30, 40, 50 million where they are

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.500
probably thinking of making a 30,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.400
a 20, a 30X, the success they

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400
call a 4, a 5X.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.480
Yes, because the risk is much smaller,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.340
they expect less and are already

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.280
entering a company that is fully

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.320
validated and what they have

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.760
to do is, with those 10 million,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.880
turn it into a global

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.500
company.
