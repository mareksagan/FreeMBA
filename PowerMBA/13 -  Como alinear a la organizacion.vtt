00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.020
One of the key or main challenges

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.960
if we want to become a more

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.380
customer-centered company is

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.020
that the entire organization,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.360
I am talking about all the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.280
people within the organization

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.940
are aligned with this, understand

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.640
it, share it, etc.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.920
I speak to you of all people

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.140
from the first to the last.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.220
And what I'm going to do is share

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.800
five tips that start from

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.180
our professional experience working

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.580
with many companies on projects

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.160
primarily aimed at helping them

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.200
evolve towards more customer-

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.540
centric companies.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.440
Everything has to start

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.120
with leadership.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.880
We have worked with managers, with

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.820
general directors, with councils,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.860
with delegate councillors of all types,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.200
there are people who understand it

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.380
better and there are people who understand

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.120
it worse.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.720
This is very important because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.080
obviously leadership is the engine

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.940
of the company and they have to understand

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.680
well that the customer is the main

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.820
asset and they have to worry

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.660
more about customers than about

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.920
the profit of that year,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.020
for sales, etc.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.340
I'll give you an example, and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.480
that's Jeff Bezos.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.460
Jeff Bezos, who always puts himself

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.440
as an example of a customer-

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.500
centered company, tells us that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.960
they see their customers as if they

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.560
were the guests to a party and they

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.300
are the ones who have organized it.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.940
And what happens when you organize

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.420
a party and have your guests,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.540
who are dismissing you for your guests?

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.420
What you want is that every detail

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.180
is perfect, what you want is

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.500
that the customer experience is

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.200
ever better.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.720
Well, since this is how Bezos tells us

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.260
that Amazon sees its customers, I think

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.660
it is very representative.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.480
Well, the first point, we already

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.220
understand it, is that those who

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.460
make the decisions must be, they

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.700
must understand well what we are talking

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
about, what we have been

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.080
talking about in the last few days.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.260
How will we get the rest

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.460
of the organization aligned

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.120
with these goals?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.860
Well, you can get through different

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.140
training levers, culture change,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840
etc., but there is one of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960
them that we propose and is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.820
that we encourage the entire

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.040
organization with

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.600
a repercussion on the retribution,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.140
we encourage them

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.060
to think about customers.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.280
How can we do this?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400
We know the most important

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.420
metrics of customer value,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.100
such as customer lifetime

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.800
value, chance rate,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.920
and NPS.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.380
We can use the most common NPS

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.360
and incorporate it within

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.720
the bonus or within the variables,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.440
in a percentage.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.140
This, for example, traditions

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.240
have not been done, traditions

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.560
have always been encouraged

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.140
based on sales, sales

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.300
growth over the past

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.500
year, etc., and now more

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.000
and more what is done is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.580
to encourage them

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.100
to think about customers

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.400
through NPS.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.620
And this is being done by many

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.100
companies, Santander incorporated

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.280
it as one of the variables within

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.620
the remuneration package

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.200
to the board members, for

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.120
example, but we have

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.080
also read that companies like

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.120
TelefÃ³nica, like Vodafone,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.720
etc., are incorporating the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.560
NPS, all of them incorporate

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.220
the NPS and what they do is

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.120
integrate the NPS as one

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.000
of the key metrics throughout

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.460
the entire organization.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.320
Let's go with the third of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.390
the tips, it's too common in companies

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.790
that we get away from customers

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.870
and this is something that happens

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.890
very naturally.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.370
Look, if you are the owner of this

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.930
restaurant is there, you know them,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.010
you know their names, their families,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.110
etc., but as soon as the company

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.650
grows something, I don't talk to

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.690
you already of large corporations,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.810
as long as the companies grow

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.050
a little it seems like that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.610
the directors, CEOs, etc., it seems

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.110
like they all tend to get away

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.450
from customers and that they are

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.770
other people who manage customers,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.090
it's a tremendous mistake and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.150
I don't want to even tell you

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.210
when we talk about large corporations,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.030
here we have the headquarters

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.950
of a corporation, because all

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.970
those people who are inside

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.210
those offices are more and more

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.350
away from customers, not only

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.170
physically, but even through

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.170
all the information flows,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.570
through all the processes,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.390
each time the information

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.210
flows worse from customers

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.970
to people who make

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.050
decisions.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.970
And look, there is a very good

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.370
initiative that we are seeing in

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.190
the last few years and there are

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.210
companies that do is to force that

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.550
a large part of the people who work

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.750
in the marketing departments for example,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.790
have gone through sales, have gone

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.470
through having or by store for

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.290
example, have had before a direct

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.830
contact with customers, because so

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.130
you understand the business much

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.070
better, so the third advice is

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.330
this, don't get away from customers

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.990
and I'll be again naming Jeff Bezos,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.630
because he always has an obsession

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.350
of being close to customers

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.110
and this is a bit anecdotal,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.550
but it is real, there is

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.690
a bus, this is the personal email

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.790
of Jeff Bezos and in it you get

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.130
because thousands of suggestions

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.830
from customer service, etc.,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.570
you can write to Jeff Bezos,

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.350
because he always has the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.550
obsession of being close

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.430
to customers.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.850
Many years ago he was the one who

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.550
received it and directly

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.470
or answered or derived it to the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.050
corresponding departments and now

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.930
there are people who filter them,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.510
but now they do get some and he

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.830
does what is rejected, in

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.250
some cases because that to the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.230
corresponding departments,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.830
but now it is already anecdotal,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.270
obviously, because Jeff Bezos

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.670
has no time to do this, but

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.630
I want you to stay with the concept,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.650
I want you to stay with the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.370
concept that one of the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.910
leaders of one of the most innovative

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.270
companies in the world

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.350
is obsessed with being

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.870
close to customers and what

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.690
it does is to keep having

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.570
that contact with them instead

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.930
of a mail account.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.550
We've taken the last of

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.510
the tips and called it empower

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.470
the front line, that is, empower

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.570
to empower people who

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.190
are in contact with the customer,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.670
which we sometimes

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.130
call the last mile.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.770
You have to realize that one of

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.510
the determining factors of customer

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.230
experience really is the contact

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.170
with the people you have within

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.370
the company, which can

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.910
be in a restaurant are the

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.630
waiters, but sometimes because

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.290
in a telephone operator

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.730
are the people you talk

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.830
to on the phone or the

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.130
sellers, etc.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.650
You have the idea.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.390
Well, the issue is that in many

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.810
cases or it is too common

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.790
that people who are in contact

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.810
with customers, first,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.590
are paid to those who have less

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.890
of the entire company, have

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.830
those who have less training

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.430
and above have no freedom

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.330
of action.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.790
You have surely lived a thousand

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.330
times a sad experience when you

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.910
are called, when you call, I know,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.950
your insurance company, your

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.430
telephone operator, etc.,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.250
and it turns out that you can never

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.630
solve your doubts because they

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.850
have no capacity and they

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.450
pass you from one department

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.210
to another, etc.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.730
Well, the issue is regardless

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.710
of this example, because not

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.050
everyone has the ability to change

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.870
something like that, it is with

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.710
what we have to stay with is

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.570
that people who are close to the

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.890
customer have to have the ability

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.830
and training and the desires

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.450
to deal with, to be able to establish

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.910
relationships, to establish

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.310
ties with customers and in

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.070
addition we have to give

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.510
them freedom.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.670
I will summarize it all in the example

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.770
of the UPS.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.790
If we think of the typical contact center

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.130
or customer service, well, how does

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.730
it usually be?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.650
Poorly paid employees, without

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.490
freedom, who have almost

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.310
a script, who can't get out of

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.150
that, etc.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.290
And they also do not

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.310
have the training to do so.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.030
The case of UFO is the opposite.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.210
What they decided was that they

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.730
wanted the customer experience to be

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.630
unique, that the customer service

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.110
in this case was unique in

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.750
the world.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.310
And what they do is to file people with

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.630
more training, pay them more and give

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.330
them absolute freedom.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.850
And of course, they have brought

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.290
it to the extreme, that anecdotes

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.030
have been generated such as that

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.710
a customer, for example, did not

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.210
find the shoes on the zapos page

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.910
and the person he was talking

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.350
to helped him buy them on a competition

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.870
page, for example.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.530
People were waiting too

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.410
long and asked for a pizza.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.790
There are examples of all kinds in

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.210
the case of zapos.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.910
But what is the impact that

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.490
this has?

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.630
The impact of this is that the

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.990
customer experience is unique

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.050
and after a call of those

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.430
you are absolutely

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.910
loyal to zapos.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.350
You have surely lived it.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.010
I'm sure that when you have

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.470
a relationship with anyone within

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.590
a company you like to be spoken

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.010
to you naturally, you like

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.810
to be not stuck, you like

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.250
to have the ability to give

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.310
you solutions.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.810
And that's why it's the last advice

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.350
we give and it's that you always think

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.290
that you don't forget that the

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.410
front line, the last mile is vital

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.690
and that you place people who have

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.990
the training and freedom to

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.110
manage or establish relationships

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.690
of certain linkage with

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.550
customers.
