00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.450
Mar, tell us above how it is, let's

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.030
analyze the business model from

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.030
the perspective of the flow

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.650
of income, how you generate income.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.310
Yes, we have several flows in

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.690
the business, there is the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.790
flow that comes from 21bottoms

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.490
brands, in the end we are charging

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.250
a commission for sales generated

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.230
within the platform to fashion

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.830
brands, where you have different

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070
types of brands, from the larger

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.330
brands that everyone knows,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.850
are smaller brands, each,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.650
all brands can have their

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.310
site and then there

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.410
is a revenue flow.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.890
For each transaction, to explain

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.950
to people who do not know

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.590
the 21bottoms model in depth,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.750
for each transaction that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750
is generated, you charge

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.110
a portion.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.630
There is a commission.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.150
Do we pay for the marks?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
That the brands pay us, we

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.750
pay the user, at the end of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.870
the day there is obviously a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.530
margin for 21bottoms.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.670
Can you say more or

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.110
less?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.870
At this time not, people know what

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.330
it charges because it's

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.770
specified within the platform.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.810
But well, they are the kind of commissions

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.110
marketplaces agree with

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.430
brands.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.550
Let's go standard.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.410
It is very simple.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.270
Yes, that's one of the flow you said.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.030
No, there are two, the brand

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.150
21bottoms and the 21bottoms to users.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.550
One entry and one exit.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.250
The main costs, what would they be?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.950
Today 21bottoms has

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.570
staff costs.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630
Obviously there is a large technical

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.990
team behind to maintain the product

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.310
and technology.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.130
And then there is a part of the marketing

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.250
team.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.650
Then you have the whole part of

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.270
acquisition, which even if it's very

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870
organic, something you always invest

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.450
and especially when you start in a market.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.830
And then you have the share you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.430
pay to users.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.010
The variable.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.150
That's what generates sales.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.030
You have, we will be talking about

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.310
fixed costs, mainly it is the team

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.110
that you have divided it into

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.070
marketing and technical product.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.010
You have a cost of customer acquisition

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.590
on the channels you use and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.670
you have the variable cost

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.170
and it is that of each of the sales

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.790
you make income, but you have

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.350
to remunerate the prescriptor

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.370
or as we call it.
