00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.500
The marketing mix and the four

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.440
P’s are the most popular concepts

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.640
and models.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.200
I’m sure they sound like you, although in

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.400
many cases it doesn’t sound, but we

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.280
really don’t know very well what it consists

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.960
of, we don’t know how to use them.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.760
Let us look at it from three

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.620
perspectives.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580
One, when it is used.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.940
What is the marketing mix?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.500
Finally, let’s look at why

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.460
we consider it a useful

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.340
tool.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.940
Let’s start with point one,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.820
when it is used.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.060
Well, let’s go back to the marketing

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.100
strategy process, to the strategic

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.580
process.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.660
And as you know, the first thing

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.640
we have to do is identify who we

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.500
are going to address.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.460
How do we do it?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.760
Segmenting the market, identifying

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.200
what our targets are, analyzing

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.220
those targets more

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.740
deeply through the customer

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.620
person.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.320
We already know who we are going to be addressing,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.900
and we also already know how they are.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.080
We need to understand your

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.720
needs, problems, etc.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.640
The first step is always

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.420
the customer.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.340
Then, what we have to do is

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.280
determine how we will target

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.820
that customer segment.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.600
We have two levels.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.460
We have a more strategic level,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.160
which is positioning, in which

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.740
it englows different components,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.920
as we saw, since

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
differentiation, brand positioning,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.360
where we want to be.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.180
This is a more strategic analysis.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.220
So, let’s go to the marketing

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.060
mix.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.280
Marketing mix is the set of tactics

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.740
or tools that will allow us

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.840
to put the strategy

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.060
into practice, in action.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.600
So, let’s make a definition.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.180
Marketing mix is the set of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.620
tools or tactics available

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.360
to the marketing manager

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.620
or marketing department

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.920
to the goals of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.720
the plan.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.560
Everything else is more strategic,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.940
but when we get to the last

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.060
part, the marketing mix, well,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.460
because it’s the tactics

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.120
we can act on.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.580
Let us go to the next point.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.460
I would like to know what

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.800
this marketing mix is.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.740
The first thing I want you to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.920
consider is that it is a mix,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.620
it is a set of factors.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.660
Within the marketing mix, we

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020
can define different models.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.140
The most famous of all, what we

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.520
have on screen, are the 4 P's,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.400
which is product, price, promotion

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.760
and distribution.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.500
But I want you to know that there

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.260
are others.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.500
It has evolved from 4 P's to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.700
7 P's.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.560
It has evolved from the 4 P’s, as

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
we will see later, to the 4 C’s, which

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.740
is a more client-centric approach.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.740
What I want you to understand

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.820
is that it is a set

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.920
of factors.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.280
It is a set of factors

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.780
on which we can act

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.780
to marketing goals

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.980
and that we need to know

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.200
are interrelated.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.880
This is key.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.320
When we define a marketing

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.460
plan, we have to consider all

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.920
the factors in an integral way,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.180
because they all relate

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.440
to each other.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.800
If we make a change in the price,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.720
it will have to have certain

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.180
repercussions, well, on the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.020
product, on the communication,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.840
on the distribution

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.640
channel, etc.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.600
All of these factors are

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.660
interrelated and the marketing

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.560
mix is the set of them.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.900
Why do we consider

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.940
marketing mix to be

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.640
a tool we should know?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.040
Well, we must know it because, among

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.840
other things, because it is a subject

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.280
almost of general culture and all professionals

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.700
who have something to do with

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.860
business administration because

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.100
they should know what the marketing

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.920
mix is.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.640
But in addition, entering a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.900
little more practical terrain,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900
the marketing mix that brings us

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
is a model, a structure that helps

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.620
us think.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.540
And you will understand.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.700
Imagine that we ask you to make

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.560
a marketing plan.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.540
Marketing is very broad.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.120
A marketing plan includes

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.660
many things, many concepts.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.800
Well, because the marketing mix,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.140
the four P’s, for example, a model

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.580
like the four P’s so simple,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.760
helps us to structure our plan.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.060
It helps us not to leave anything

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.260
in the way.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.580
The same thing if I tell you to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.040
analyze the marketing plan of any

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.280
company, Coca-Cola.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.140
Where do you start?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.020
It is complicated.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.280
Well, because knowing models like the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.820
marketing mix and integrating them

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.860
into our way of thinking allows

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.240
us to structure.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.780
As we have said, we will not

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.940
lose anything.
