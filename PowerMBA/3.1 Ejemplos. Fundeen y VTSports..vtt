00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.150
Let's see the history of funding.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.270
Funding is a company created, founded

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.990
and led by Nacho and AdriÃ¡n Bautista,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.790
who are two young entrepreneurs

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.530
with an enormous potential

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.870
who are Power MBA students.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.670


00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.710
What is Funding dealing with?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.790
Well, it is a crowdfunding platform

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.130
that allows small investors,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.990
with a minimum ticket of 500

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.970
euros, to invest in renewable

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.430
energy projects.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.290
And what we have to keep very careful

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.790
is that you do not access

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.030
this type of projects otherwise,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.310
unless you have a much larger

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.970
capital.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.950
So they are giving small investors

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.910
the opportunity to benefit from

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.270
a type of investment that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.890
they would not otherwise.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.370
Let us start creating history.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.330
As always, the goal from history

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.350
is that the protagonist, that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.810
the customer, feels identified

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.970
from the first moment, we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.630
attach him, accompany

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.750
him in decision making and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.690
convince him.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.990
And in addition, that basically

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.630
we be able to convey how Funding

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.630
can make your life better.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.390


00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.210
As we have said, the client

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.890
is the client.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.470
And how are they?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.530
Well, basically anyone who has

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
some money saved and it will

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.310
be easier to convince those

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.390
who have some proactivity,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.870
to be investors.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.890
The first analysis we have to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.810
do, which you always have

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.610
to do, is what the protagonist wants?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.750
Because if we are able to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.550
identify what the protagonist

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.410
wants, we will get him tied

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.750
up from the beginning.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.450
What is the main goal of investing

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.830
in renewable energy?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.130
Well, it may be that it is the medium,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.010
but in the bottom, the main desire

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.350
of the protagonist, of any savings

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.390
maker, of any investor, is to get

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.510
a greater profitability, with

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.990
little risk to that money

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.190
that has cost him so much to win.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.510
That is the real motivation and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.710
we must appeal to that.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.170
Here I want to hint that when it

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.290
comes to investments, as there

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.070
has been a lot of Timo, there

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.090
are many companies that are

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.350
and that offer high returns,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.790
etc., we do not have to be

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.150
excessively aggressive in

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.370
copies, because we can generate

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.430
that insecurity, but we

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.330
have to be clear.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.410
What the protagonist wants is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.510
that, that we get through investments

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.930
in renewable energy is an excellent

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.350
means to do so, but the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.130
protagonist's real desire is

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.090
to earn more money, to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.210
get more profitability the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.010
money he has.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.270
In addition, in this case we can appeal

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.770
to sustainability, we can incorporate

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.310
it into copies, in audio, etc.,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.990
we can incorporate the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.830
sustainable concept, because it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.630
may be another of the desires

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.250
that we can awaken in the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.070
protagonist.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.430
We are seeing investments improving

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.370
in the world.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.870
The theme is that as in all

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.170
history always problems arise

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.410
and our protagonist has mainly

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.910
a problem, and is that to that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.330
type of investments can not access,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.190
because that type of investments

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.730
usually require tickets much

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.630
higher than 500 euros, then

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.350
there are other people who

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.770
benefit from those investments,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.530
but not he, who are people with

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.850
a lot of money, who invests

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.290
through managers, investment

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.990
funds, etc., but he is a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.410
small investor, a saviour, a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.530
normal person, current, who

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.950
has no access and in many

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.110
cases will not have great

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.330
financial knowledge, etc.,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.230
and all this can generate

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.770
the protagonist a series of

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.130
internal problems, which

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.970
are truly potent.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.490
As I always say, if we are able

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.770
to appeal to internal problems,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.730
not to external ones that are

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.310
objective facts, it is when

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.410
our history will be more powerful.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.990
What are the internal problems?

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.390
Well, that disappointment that can

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.290
be generated to the protagonist by

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.030
facing the fact that it really costs

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.570
him to earn money, but that he

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.190
does not have the capabilities

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.150
to get the most profit from

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.610
that money, but others do.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.470
Here what we could do, Fandino,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.990
which you could incorporate into

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.910
your story, are copies as all the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.310
big fortunes invest in renewable

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.190
energies, you have to make

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.530
the protagonist see that others

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.450
are doing it and he is not.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.090
The moment of the story comes when

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.470
Fandino has to be positioned as

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.830
a guide, as a solution to that problem

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.250
and has to say now you can do

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.610
it, from now on you can benefit

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.130
from investments, from investments

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.810
like these, from renewable

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.190
energy projects, because I

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.630
am here and because I have given

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.690
the solution, because I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.610
have created a crowdfunding platform.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.450
The real challenge here, in the case

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.430
of Fandino, in the case

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.590
of any company that offers this

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.710
type of investment services,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.890
the main challenge is authority,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.450
is to generate sufficient

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.550
authority or trust.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.510
Why is it?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.190
Everyone is scared of their

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.850
money.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.290
There are other things where you

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.790
make the decision very quickly,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.430
you don't need so much to offer

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.490
you so much security.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.590
In this story, it is necessary.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.030
I have already visualized

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.110
that I would love to invest in renewable

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.290
energy projects that I alone

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.750
can't.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.850
I love the proposal to do it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.290
through more people, through

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.350
a crowdfunding platform, but

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.830
I can get those doubts of

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.410
this people is reliable enough?

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.930
Funding should generate

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.470
that confidence.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.030
How to do?

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.390
Well, because by answering

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.790
other people giving very professional

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.250
information about the projects,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.410
what I can do is give data

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.570
on the volume invested, etc.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.370
This is how you need to build that confidence.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.650
And, at this point, funding what you

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.350
have to do is propose a plan to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.770
the protagonist, tell him exactly

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.010
how it will work, because when

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.990
we get there, we also have a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.650
lot of doubts.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.990
What will be the profitabilities?

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.830
When should I make the investment?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.010
Will I be able to take my money?

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.450
The typical doubts of any investment.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.730
And if funding is not able at that

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.730
moment to expose a very clear plan,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.930
which will generate a lot of comfort

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.650
to the protagonist, the protagonist

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.070
may have valued and see the attraction

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.690
of the story, see the happy end,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.510
but they will generate so many

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.710
doubts that they will not decide

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.130
to move forward.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.670
Once funding has drawn the way,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.030
it has filled the way, it

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.290
has told you exactly the steps

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.770
you have to give the protagonist,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.070
that is, we always have to

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.130
do very easy, the protagonist

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.190
has to understand how you

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.250
can do business with us

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.930
in the simplest way possible.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.370
The next step is to ask you to

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.210
make a decision.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.910
The call to action

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.750
is a transitional call

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.110
to action.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.830
Please let us know because

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.450
we will keep you informed.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.390
People will not make the decision

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.310
at once.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.070
As you know, we separate call to

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.450
action that are more direct

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.530
or immediate from transitional call to action.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.770
In some cases, you have to combine the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.870
two and in the case of funding I think

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.650
that it would be necessary to

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.170
combine the two.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.690
The first one will want to

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.690
know a little more.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.670
We must also give him the

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.170
opportunity to do so.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.330
And effectively, in order for him

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.310
to make the decision, so that he decides

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.630
to invest his money and trust

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.870
him, he has to show him as always

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.170
what is being played in this story.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.490
What is the happy end and what is it

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.530
that we will help you avoid.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.930
And the happy end, the happy end is

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.570
we have to clarify very well the profitability

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.750
that will be obtained and we

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.870
also have to appeal to that you

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.150
feel ready, that you feel that

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.090
you are taking advantage of an opportunity,

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.170
that you feel an investor,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.090
to contribute to the environment,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.910
etc.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.370
It is always very important.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.570
Don't forget to always make it

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.990
clear to the protagonist what it is

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.090
that you're going to win, because

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.790
otherwise you won't have enough

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.230
motivation to make a decision.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.370
Not least in a case like this where

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.530
you have to invest your money.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.470
And on the other hand, what we also

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.950
have to do to you is see what

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.370
the risk we will help you avoid.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.710
And in this case the risk we will

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.090
help you avoid is the opportunity

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.150
cost of not doing so, of

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.530
not making the decision, is that

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.690
now it is not taking and we

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.890
have seen it relatively simple to

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.890
create a story that is attractive,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.950
gluing the protagonist

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.270
from the first moment with a desire

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.470
that it has true that it really

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.970
has, not losing us in details

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.710
of what we offer, but from its

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.310
desire, totally client-centric,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.490
making it visualize

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.950
that it has a problem,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.950
that we are there to help it

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.010
and what are the steps it

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.730
will give and finally, what

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.810
is what is being played, because

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.110
in depending on that you understand

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.130
what is what is being played,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.170
how will you make the

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.930
decision to trust

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.070
us or not?
