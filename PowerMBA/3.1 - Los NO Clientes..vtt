WEBVTT

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.080
One of the key concepts or

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.400
legs of the Blue Ocean strategy

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.140
is what they call non-customers.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.260


00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
No customers, no customers

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.620
we refer to targeting

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.940
a target audience, a target

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.080
segment that so far has

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.560
not bought us or any of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.520
our competitors.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.700
It's thinking of people, explained

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.000
so in a simple way, in people who

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.340
are not buying us.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.320
And this has huge benefits

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.700
obviously because you think

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.220
that in any sector all competitors

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.860
within that sector are targeting

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.740
current customers, current

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.900
customer segments

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.500
and all struggle

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.540
for the same cake.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.800
But the blue ocean strategy proposes

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.940
us not to go to that

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.940
cake, what you do is create

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.920
another.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.740
Basically it would be something That's, that'

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.900
s the important thing about the strategy.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.200
Instead of fighting them all for the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.780
same piece of cake, let's look for

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.500
another cake in which we are alone

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.420
at least initially.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.500
That is.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.520
Well, then if you tell us, because clear,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000
but it is that it is very, Carlos said

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.160
no, it is that it is very complicated

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.020
really think of no customers or

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.300
seek no customers is of the most

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.720
difficult things that there are

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.740
in the blue ocean strategy.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.020
Of course, it's difficult because

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.820
we're talking about not

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.040
customers precisely, we're talking

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.560
about segments that we haven't

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
even noticed we could get to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.880
sell them.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.860
But if we are able to work on that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.540
reflection as we work on

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.640
it, we will see that more segments

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.860
are conceived of us.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
This is a matter of habit like

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760
almost everything in life,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.080
insist until we are with a segment

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
where we can really differentiate.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.640
Look, what you say, what you said

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.600
I love and I have said, I have said

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.820
it many times throughout the Power

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.960
MBA and I think that this, I don'

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.100
t know, generally innovate at the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.680
business level doesn't need to

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.340
be creative.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.860
It is not necessary to be a creative

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.840
person, it is necessary to know this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.040
type of tools, it is necessary,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.140
as you said, the habit, for

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.020
example, to think in these terms.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.040
If I get used to thinking about non-

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.560
customers, the day I have a new

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.660
project, I start thinking about

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060
non-customers from the beginning,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.040
I start thinking in those terms

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320
and so it's much easier to innovate.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.700
In fact, in addition to many times

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.380
to test a new segment of customers

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.000
does not require a large investment,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.680
neither economic nor in time,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.420
nor much less in risk,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.380
so that in the event that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.480
we did not succeed, nothing

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.840
happens.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.860
We're insisting on a new

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.280
segment of non-customers until

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280
we finally find our ocean.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.520
That is.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.940
Tell us some examples of companies

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.240
that have known how to think about non-

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.840
customers and have successfully

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.640
captured them.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.100
Well, the example that comes to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.620
mind closest to everyone we

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.560
are here is the Power MBA

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.100
itself.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.700
The Power MBA has been aimed at

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.020
a segment of customers, not

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.160
clients, aware that they had a need

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.660
to improve their training,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.580
their skills for management,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.660
in the end, each will have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.520
their concerns and goals,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.400
but all of them shared the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.400
one that they possibly did not

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.060
consider to make a traditional

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.560
MBA for a matter of cost,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.620
but also in many cases

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.940
of time.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.220
The Power MBA is aimed at that large

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.040
segment of non-customers with

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.880
a proposal that truly fits them in

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.000
time and cost.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.100
Yes, it is so, it is something that is

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.920
right, it is something we have said many

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.120
times, that many of our students are

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.740
knowledgeable of the proposals that

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.680
are in the traditional MBAs and are

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.540
people who do not square them, they

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.520
are not clients because they do

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.100
not square them, because no, many are

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.960
very busy people who do not have the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.520
time to stop studying during, well,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.020
because they devote so much time

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.800
and there are people who either

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.680
do not have or do not have the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.120
money or do not want to spend it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.580
and also are knowledgeable that

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.780
you can learn otherwise.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.140
So that's actually one of the reasons

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.000
for the success of The Power MBA.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.240
Another example that I think of and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.880
that we have already talked about

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.720
in previous classes is that of the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.880
male segment for a pharmacy office.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.280
Men, being about half the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.900
population, are not pharmacy

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.240
customers beyond going to buy

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.740
a drug or a cream on

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.620
order, yet men take care

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.900
of themselves more and more,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.080
do not do gyms, do not

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.820
do sports stores, do

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.500
not do pipes, talk on social

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.400
media, but do not

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.060
do it in pharmacies.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.580
That pharmacy that provides a

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.240
specific value proposal for a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.920
segment of non-customers such

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.880
as men, will probably see their

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.620
business increased in a tremendously

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.620
high percentage.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.740
Surely that is?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.480
Another example that we have also

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.100
seen very recently in previous classes,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.180
the sun circus itself, thinking

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.750
about making one of these points

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.880
is something tremendously innovative,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.940
it is an entire segment that

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.940
the circus in principle had

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.080
not set up to address it.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.620
Once you choose it and differences

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.760
and adapt your value proposal, the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.120
benefits that are achieved,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.480
as we will see below, derived

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.440
from directing customers are

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.980
enormous.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.700
And finally, one example that

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.540
I especially like is the

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.060
hamburger chain known

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.860
by the whole world.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.860
Who is McDonald's selling to?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.120
McDonald's sells to families, children,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.400
grandparents, during the weekends,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.260
between weeks and sometimes

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.760
for birthday celebrations

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.080
and always at their establishments.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.480
Well, there has been a

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.160
huge innovation at McDonald'

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.560
s since they decided not

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.240
long ago to target a huge

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.980
segment of non-customers.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.920
And I'm referring to the segment of

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.880
boyfriends, people who get married

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.400
and who are increasingly making these

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.140
weddings in private properties,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.840
usually not in restaurants, because

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.880
this would compete with McDonald's.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.920
Thinking of a segment of customers

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.020
who would never have gone to celebrate

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.480
their wedding or anything like McDonald'

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.980
s, McDonald's has been able to differentiate

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.280
its proposal to the value of

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.380
adapting it to this segment.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.700
Thinking of the coves, in that tentempié

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.920
that give us high hours of the

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.060
morning to be able to lengthen

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.200
the party and celebrate the wedding

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.620
a little more.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.940
What has McDonald's changed?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.540
For almost everything, it had

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.600
to move, something that it did

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.440
not before, it was always as we

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.740
said in its establishments, it had

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.820
to move to the estate where the weddings

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.160
are celebrated, it has had to

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.240
design a whole bet on the scene

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.460
through different vintage

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.140
cartels, a portfolio of products

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.420
since those smaller and lighter,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.720
suitable for the type of

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.760
consumption that will be

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.980
made.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.320
But it's a great example of non-

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.600
customers, every euro McDonald'

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.280
s sells at a wedding bar would

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.680
not have sold it in any way

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.820
if it hadn't thought in terms

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.620
of non-customers.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.380
This is a surprising

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.540
and clear example.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.780
To really conclude this class,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.060
as we said at the beginning, one

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.620
of the criteria for creating a Blue

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.980
Ocean is to think of non-customers

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.280
because when they talk about a

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.480
Blue Ocean they talk about a new

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.620
market space, a space where

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.780
there are no competitors

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.620
and the only way to really

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.960
create a new market space

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.080
is to go to a new space of

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.840
demand, to a new group of non-

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.360
customers, people who are

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.800
not buying you until that moment.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.720
What happens is that you have the right to...

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.340
No, I told you because if you actually

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.700
head to an existing market

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.000
segment your strategy

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.160
will be different.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.680
What the Blue Ocean strategy brings

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.740
us is to think in terms of

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.560
not customers and create that

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.640
Blue Ocean.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.600
If we are able to it in greater

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.900
or lesser measure and have seen

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.840
examples that I think are relevant,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.200
let us follow, let me summarize,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.920
Borja, the benefits that

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.340
from my point of view we will

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.820
have if we that success

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.020
in non-customers.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.940
First, an incremental business,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.220
as we said at McDonald's,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.260
sell where we would not

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.740
have sold in any other way

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.140
if we had not applied this

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.900
strategy.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.960
Create a very strong differentiation

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.220
that will reduce or even eliminate

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.260
competition sometimes and

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.860
that will immediately

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.700
result in an increase

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.460
in our profitability.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.440
And we will also generate some

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.000
entry barriers that will make

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.900
it very difficult for a competitor

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.060
to be ahead of us and be he who

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.120
at that time steals our

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.380
current customers.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.580
So, I think not being the

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.160
only leg of the Blue

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.780
Ocean strategy is thinking

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.580
in terms of no customers,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.220
possibly the most Totally

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.820
Agree.
