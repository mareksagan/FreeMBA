00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
Today we are going to analyze the case of the Ambrusco. It is a good case to continue reinforcing

00:15.520 --> 00:19.120
the strategy of the blue ocean, especially taking into account that we start from a true

00:19.120 --> 00:24.280
red ocean. Because I think you will be with me Carlos in that the wine industry and also

00:24.280 --> 00:32.360
the wine industry are very different. The C20E is a very competitive industry in which it is

00:32.360 --> 00:37.480
very difficult to differentiate and also very fragmented. If we talk about the wine industry

00:37.480 --> 00:42.840
worldwide, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of wineries in which it is very difficult

00:42.840 --> 00:50.280
to really stand out, differentiate, etc. You just have to go to the winery in a supermarket

00:50.280 --> 00:55.920
and see everything that is there. If you put yourself in the role of the wineries that are selling,

00:55.920 --> 01:01.000
that are the owners of that wine, it is clear that it is very complicated. And the Ambrusco

01:01.000 --> 01:07.680
is a good example of how to think about no customers, how to create innovation in value, etc.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.040
Tell us Carlos a little bit about how this strategic evolution was born.

01:14.040 --> 01:21.400
Well, indeed, the Ambrusco is a good example of how in a saturated industry, as you say,

01:21.400 --> 01:29.000
to do something different by thinking about no-customer segments. Who are the no-customer segments

01:29.000 --> 01:33.600
or the main no-customer segment for a winery? Well, in general, all those people

01:33.600 --> 01:39.240
who do not usually drink wine and do not usually drink wine for many reasons, because they do not know it well,

01:39.240 --> 01:45.720
because they are not able to appreciate it, because they are ashamed of not knowing how to choose a good wine,

01:45.720 --> 01:55.120
whether it is in adequate conditions or not, because they do not like to drink alcoholic beverages in general.

01:55.120 --> 02:03.600
Well, thinking about them, Ambrusco appears with a very different proposal than what currently exists

02:04.080 --> 02:10.400
in the market. If we look at the strategic picture and to summarize it, as a current situation,

02:10.400 --> 02:17.640
we see two value curves, the red one, a reserve wine, a high-end wine and therefore also a high price,

02:17.640 --> 02:23.760
which without a doubt has its market, and then more economic wines, wines in the medium term,

02:23.760 --> 02:29.760
which are not so expensive but which do not make a great difference.

02:30.120 --> 02:37.120
Carlos, what do they really invest in? What are the factors or variables in this sector?

02:37.120 --> 02:47.360
Well, as we are seeing in the image, there is a whole initial investment in producing that wine,

02:47.360 --> 02:59.800
in creating it for many years, either in barrels or in bottles, in creating a brand in the market

02:59.800 --> 03:08.640
that allows me a certain degree of differentiation, some design, sometimes in itself to have a

03:08.640 --> 03:15.160
denomination of origin and for that I have to have my vineyards in a certain area, etc.

03:15.720 --> 03:21.040
Well, all this is true that it configures different value proposals for those who appreciate

03:21.040 --> 03:27.080
wine, but if we think of a segment of customers who usually do not drink wine for the reasons that

03:27.080 --> 03:34.320
I said, we see in the image the value curve, the value proposal of the Ambrusco. If we analyze a

03:34.320 --> 03:38.440
little how it has been playing with the different variables, we see that in price, it has opted,

03:38.440 --> 03:43.640
thinking of a non-drinker of wine for an affordable price, logically, it is difficult to convince

03:43.640 --> 03:49.000
someone who does not drink wine if we offer it a very high price for the bottle. The brand does not seem

03:49.000 --> 03:55.240
very reasonable to invest in it in a segment, I insist that a priori it has no interest in

03:55.240 --> 04:02.240
wine. The years in a barrel I do not even want to tell you, it does not take 30 minutes in a barrel

04:02.240 --> 04:06.520
because we are really heading for a segment that neither appreciates nor sees value.

04:06.880 --> 04:13.840
I understand that this particular factor, that is, the fact that in the processes that

04:13.840 --> 04:18.640
aging is much less, that there is no barrel, has to have a huge impact

04:18.640 --> 04:23.680
on the cost reduction, right? Of course, indeed, part of that reduction

04:23.680 --> 04:33.800
is due to the price and another part without any better profitability. Because, for example,

04:33.800 --> 04:38.120
the design, I am seeing, the design, it is true that it decreases in design, but well,

04:38.120 --> 04:45.000
the design in the end is not such an important cost factor. I understand that where

04:45.000 --> 04:52.440
innovation is really here is in simplifying the processes of the manufacture of wine,

04:52.440 --> 04:59.040
which is basically aging. And the investment in brand too.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
And the investment in brand.

05:00.040 --> 05:10.040
In some way it is something that does not impact, that a non-wine drinking client decides with a brand.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
Yes, indeed.

05:11.040 --> 05:19.040
Again, the variety of offer too. In Lambrusco we mainly have pink wine with a little needle,

05:19.040 --> 05:26.040
some white and some red, but mainly a very focused variety in pink wine.

05:26.040 --> 05:34.040
What you say about the variety of offer, is a factor that also has a cost repercussion

05:34.040 --> 05:42.040
in all industries, beastly. Companies that are able to go on the market with very few products.

05:42.040 --> 05:50.040
I was talking recently with a watch manufacturer, one of the leading companies worldwide,

05:50.040 --> 05:57.040
and he told me that they have many watches, many, many, many models of watches.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.040
And he told me, for example, that Rolex has been selling the Submariner,

06:02.040 --> 06:05.040
because it has sold millions and millions of that model.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.040
And of course, when you get to have a very low variety of offer,

06:08.040 --> 06:11.040
effectively your returns are much higher.

06:11.040 --> 06:17.040
And in this case, the wineries usually have whites, reds, well, they have very different wines.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.040
Different types.

06:18.040 --> 06:23.040
That's it. And Lambrusco, what you have is, what did you say, there are two, right?

06:23.040 --> 06:25.040
Well, mainly pink, as I said.

06:25.040 --> 06:30.040
If you are able to agglutinate and concentrate your offer in two or three maximum products,

06:30.040 --> 06:34.040
in the end it is infinitely profitable, because there are economies of scale,

06:34.040 --> 06:39.040
that when you fragment your portfolio a lot, it gets much more complicated.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.040
In return, and thinking again for non-wine drinkers,

06:43.040 --> 06:46.040
we find that Lambrusco makes a slightly different use.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.040
It is an easy to drink wine, easy to choose.

06:49.040 --> 06:54.040
In general, with that it is fresh, it is more than enough to be fine.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.040
It is found in supermarkets.

06:56.040 --> 07:03.040
Well, as we see, it is a value proposition that, without being the best wine,

07:03.040 --> 07:06.040
there are people who would even say that it is not even wine,

07:06.040 --> 07:13.040
but it is undoubtedly the best value proposition for the non-wine drinkers.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.040
If we look at it from the point of view of Amaltur and Rize,

07:16.040 --> 07:21.040
what has decreased a lot are the factors of brand, aging,

07:21.040 --> 07:24.040
designation of origin, design and such, and then what they have done is create some, right?

07:24.040 --> 07:29.040
Create factors that the rest of the wineries had never taken into account,

07:29.040 --> 07:33.040
because a winery has never taken into account that its wine is easy to drink or easy to choose.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.040
They compete in other things, right? They compete in the rest of the variables.

07:37.040 --> 07:43.040
Indeed. Basically, what Lambrusco has done is reduce all aspects that generate cost

07:43.040 --> 07:50.040
and increase everything that favors a different use or facilitates the use of the drink.

07:50.040 --> 07:59.040
With a cost, in addition, it generates little impact, because the easy choice or that it is an easy product to drink,

07:59.040 --> 08:01.040
does not generally impact the cost.

08:01.040 --> 08:06.040
You may think that it is a better or worse wine, this is a matter of opinion,

08:06.040 --> 08:10.040
but the important and relevant thing is that more than 40 million bottles are sold a year,

08:10.040 --> 08:13.040
and this is exactly what it is about.

08:13.040 --> 08:18.040
Making a wine that is the best wine for the segment we are heading,

08:18.040 --> 08:24.040
let's remember the non-drinkers, and that also generates a business of the volume we have increased.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.040
Indeed, of course, if we ask people in the wine industry,

08:28.040 --> 08:31.040
I'm sure many fans will tell us what you have told us,

08:31.040 --> 08:34.040
that it is a very bad wine, but it is not that it is a bad wine or a good wine,

08:34.040 --> 08:37.040
it is that Lambrusco is a wine, look at what Carlos was telling us,

08:37.040 --> 08:41.040
that it is with a value proposal designed for non-drinkers of wine.

08:42.040 --> 08:48.040
Indeed, and for this segment, it is possibly better than any other wine that we could find in the market,

08:48.040 --> 08:49.040
no matter how expensive it is.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.040
Indeed, and it is also very brilliant to address non-drinkers of wine,

08:52.040 --> 08:56.040
because the rest of the wineries, which are hundreds of thousands of wineries in the world,

08:56.040 --> 08:58.040
are competing for wine drinkers.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.040
So if you decide to address those who are not drinkers,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.040
and on top of that you manage to capture them because your proposal fits them,

09:04.040 --> 09:06.040
well, that's when you've created a blue ocean,

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
and when you manage to sell 40 million bottles, which is a barbarity.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Indeed.
