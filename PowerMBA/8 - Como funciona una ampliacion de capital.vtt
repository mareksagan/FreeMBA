00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.950
Luis, we talk a lot about capital

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.210
expansion, but I really believe

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.090
that our students have many doubts,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.410
and in fact, in many cases,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.190
they consult us, and I will

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.930
go asking.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.750
There is one of them, that I know

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.870
that a lot of people cause curiosity,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.210
and it is how the startups fund

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.390
the growth, in some cases making

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.630
rounds in capital enlargements, in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.330
which all the money is put by investors,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.630
however, the founders continue

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.470
to have a majority part of the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.650
company, when usually this did

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.250
not work like this, because

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.670
if you make an extension of capital

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.830
and all the money put others,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.570
because it seems that the traditional

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.230
mechanism was that they

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.710
would stay with 100%

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.710
or almost the entire company.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.050


00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.870
How does this exactly work?

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.570
Well, here you are right that is a

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.910
lot of curiosity and that generates

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.090
doubts, and the answer is very

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.910
simple, the mechanism is very simple,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.070
this time it is what is called

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.010
the assumption premium or emission

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.610
premium, coming from SSA or SL.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.810
Here I speak of course of Spanish

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.150
regulations, but in reality

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.530
the mechanism from a mathematical

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.470
point of view is exactly

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.250
the same all over the world,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.710
the concept of dilution.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.910
I'll explain a little from a Spanish

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.490
point of view how it works,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.210
but I insist, the principle

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.510
of how it works from a mathematical

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.310
point of view is exactly

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.870
the same.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.310
You imagine, for example, I'm going

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.090
to put a very specific case, you

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.510
imagine that we have a company in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.530
which we have a company that has an

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.670
initial social capital, for example,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.990
of 10,000 euros and that wants

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.690
to raise 100,000 euros.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.050
The founders, in fact, have put

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.290
10,000 euros in capital at the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.510
time of the Constitution.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410
Exactly, without any priority and without anything.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.730
So, we want to capture 100,000 euros

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.510
of investment and with a valuation

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.090
of the company of one million

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.610
euros.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.790
Post money means after the investment.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.410


00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.270
If it is post money one million euros

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.170
and we have contributed 100,000, then

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.050
pre money would be 900,000.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.150
That is, the founders have put

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.910
10,000 euros, as they need

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.750
to finance their growth,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.250
they turn to investors that

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.910
investors put 100,000.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.790
and exact.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.330
by 100,000.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.530
Well, and what you say is that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.730
at this point, when this capital

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.050
expansion is made, the company is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.210
valued at one million euros.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.630
Well, that is, you can value anything,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.270
but in your example the valuation

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.490
is one million euros.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.170
Post money is a million euros.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.590
Post money means, I'll explain,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.510
that that million euros is what

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.730
the company is worth after

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.590
investors have put those

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.890
100,000 to clarify it.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.910
actually is.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.410
So, if we didn't make this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.930
calculation of the first

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.970
issue, what would happen?

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.450
That the company would have 110,000

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030
euros and 90%, 90% and peak percent

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.390
of the company would be the investors,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.550
which doesn't make sense.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.670
In this context we

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.530
are talking about.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.570
In the end, how does this work?

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.550
But in the end, what we do is that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.910
we divide that contribution, those 100,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.010
000 euros, into an extension of social

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.610
capital, a 10%, is worth.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.350
That is, those 10,000 we have

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.170
to increase a 10% to 11,000, 111

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.290
approximately.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.030
That is, social capital.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.330
Yes, the 10,000 euros are converted

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.830
to 11.100, 11.100 euros.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.070
We'll do it in big numbers.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.510
The share capital is increased from 10,000 to 11,000.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.010
11,000 long but 11,000.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.330
And all the other money, all those

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.390
98,000 and peak euros, would go in the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.530
concept of a premium of issue or

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.070
premium of assumption, okay?

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.610
That assumption premium is a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.830
accounting concept that is part of

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.110
your balance sheet and that is

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.090
in your own funds, right?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.090
As if it was a reserve, really.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.310
It is not capital, but it is something

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.290
very similar, so that we understand,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.830
it is something very similar to

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.130
capital.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.150
Yes, it's a fund of own funds, it's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.870
part of your own funds.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.170
That is a premium that is called.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.170
Why is it called premium?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.370
I like the English name because

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.790
it is very well understood.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.170
It is the extra you pay in your company

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.670
for the difference between the social

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.450
capital you have registered

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.830
in your books and the actual

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.290
value.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.790
The real value of this is estimated

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.850
at one million euros.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.270
Exactly, then it's a premium, it's

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.070
like an extra premium that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.130
you're paying for later joining

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.750
the company.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.270
That is.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.770
That is the way to function.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.110
And the consequence of this is that

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.790
the founders who put 10,000 euros

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.670
and had at the time 100%,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.310
at the time zero had 100% of

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.530
the company, then they

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.650
have achieved that it is valued

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.090
in a million euros and that investors

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.830
are also in agreement with

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.870
that valuation, and

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.430
thanks to it after making

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.630
the round, the founders

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.250
still have him, in this case

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.890
90% of the company.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.350
and exact.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.850
All the money was actually invested

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.690
by the investors.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.950
Exactly, in this case, yes, well,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.850
the 10,000 euros initiated have

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.310
been put in one way or another,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.730
but effectively, but the great subsequent

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.870
contribution has been divided

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.470
in that way.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.470
This is a mathematically

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.910
meaningful process.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.990
It is completely homogeneous in

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.830
all countries, it works exactly

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.510
the same.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.470
What changes is the way it

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.370
is implemented.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.510
I don't know if this is a topic

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.170
you want to comment on.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.590
It changes the way it is implemented.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.910
Legal or how?

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.210
Yes, legally, that is, we have

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.050
said how the mathematical model

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.570
of dilution works.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.670
It is that I think it is very important

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.550
to understand the dilution model because, how

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.970
can you finance with a full capital

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.570
without diluting yourself.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.550
And here, of course, here is the interest

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.490
of the founders in making the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.130
rating as high as possible so that

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.590
your license is...

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.170
Exactly so.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.970
There is one tip that we always give

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.430
in the face of this and it seems,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.490
again from a mathematical point

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.890
of view, that it is very important

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.510
that your rating be as high as possible.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.010
Look, because that can guarantee

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.470
you get little dilution in an

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.650
initial round, but the higher

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.570
your valuation in the initial

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.770
phases, the higher it has to be

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.510
in the rounds so that it does not

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.930
harm the interests of the investors

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.450
who enter at the beginning.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.450
So I have a advice for

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.290
everyone, please be consistent,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.630
have a roadmap and be

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.830
able to consolidate or

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.270
defend your value always

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.990
in many rounds.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.490
And that's not because it's too high,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.490
it's something that's going

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.570
to be necessarily good for you.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.130
Because defending that value

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.090
over time forces you to do many

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.410
things that are not always easy.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.590
That advice you give us coincides

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.410
perfectly, that is, coincides with

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.570
one that Izanami gave us that was

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.310
exactly the same.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.210
That is, investors are entering

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.850
your company to get a plus-

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.830
value, to multiply by

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.230
10 for example that investment

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.910
they have made.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.130
If you in the first rounds, for

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.810
example, the rating is too

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.350
high and then you are not able

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.670
to grow, because you are placing

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.490
yourself in a complicated

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.370
situation for you, for

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.110
investors, etc.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.910
Because they won't accompany you,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.130
you won't be able to continue funding

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.050
growth, etc.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.830
It's especially difficult for

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.090
you to follow the next round because

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.510
you're going to be harming the interest

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.750
of your first investors who

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.350
may no longer accompany you.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.490
There is one term that I would like

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.370
our students to know and it is the

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.010
cap table.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.210
The cap table is, after having done

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.250
the capital operation with the first

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.310
issue, the cap table is the final

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.770
photo, of which is the distribution

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.390
between all.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.890
Exactly, it's a very simple

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.090
term, it's just like you say,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.250
it's like an excel, it doesn't talk

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.850
to you in what you have who each of

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.730
the partners is, like the registration

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.510
book of partners.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.530
Who each of the partners is, what

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.350
percentage it has, what shares or

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.570
social participations it corresponds to.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.190
This is a concept that is

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.630
used a lot.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.030
It is true that we use it as a currency,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.450
it is something that has been centralized

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.750
as a way of referring, but it

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.990
is a frame of partners, it is

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.350
nothing more complicated than

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.770
that.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.250
Perfect, but it is good that the concepts

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.610
are fixed because they are concepts

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.950
that do not come out to

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.110
us on a daily basis, but that

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.150
in other environments are not

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.690
so usual.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.770
And finally, I would like you

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.190
to explain how the operative is,

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.570
how the sequential steps in a

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.050
capital issue are.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.890
Well, I will do it from a

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.550
perspective a little Spanish law

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.950
by derivation or professional

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.210
deviation, but good is a mechanism

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.630
that is virtually identical

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.630
in almost all countries because

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.650
at the end there is the double

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.270
instance of document or

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.570
registration and so on.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.970
The first thing we have to be clear

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.150
is that the social capital is

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.810
part of the statutes of a company,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.050
that is, there is a section

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.950
that usually is between 2 and 5

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.070
of the statutes in which it says,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.630
this company has a social

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.350
capital of x euros divided into

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.770
so many shares and social

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.110
participations, as it forms

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.630
part of that structure.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.650
To change it, we have to go to a public

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.750
document without registering within

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.670
the register.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.570
So what do we do?

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.730
There is a general board agreement,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.330
we have all the partners together

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.130
and we have decided to make that

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.790
capital increase.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.330
Depending on what we have agreed and according

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.630
to what the statutes say, there will

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.070
be one mechanism or another or it

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.870
will require more or less majorities.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.170
In principle, a simple majority

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.190
should be enough to make

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.030
a capital increase.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.250
So that means that we gather,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.730
increase capital, decide,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.510
we will increase our first

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.790
issue, while the first issue

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.590
is not among the statutes.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.730
So, general board, general board,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.350
there is no need to get together, there

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.190
are many ways to do so, let's say,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.110
by general, we will not go into

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.310
the detail, but in general it is a

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.710
record, with a certificate that

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.690
is public and that certificate then

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.250
goes to the property registration,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.550
so that when someone accesses

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.090
within six months to the register

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.710
you can see that there has been

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.970
an act of constitution and then

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.650
successive acts of capital increase,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.130
each in the amount and you can

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.050
reconstruct the history and capital

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.870
of your company well through annual

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.590
accounts in which a balance sheet

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.290
will appear with the

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.190
capital or the agreements

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.350
that are in the situation

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.310
of registration.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.890
In the record, perfectly.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.290
I will finish this class

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.770
by saying that effectively as you

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.450
are well saying, all this is more

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.150
complex than it seems and also

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.450
between doing well and doing

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.490
bad it may be that we know cases

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.130
between doing well and doing bad,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.910
because the founders can end

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.590
up in a situation of unprotected,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.070
they can lose money, etc., then

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.170
the recommendation here that

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.530
I will do it I do not, for you

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.170
is that we say that they seek

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.990
advice like yours in Metrixon

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.910
so that they accompany them

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.890
in that process.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.570
That's a good advice, I agree

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:34.890
with you.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.590
And I say it really because I know

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.630
cases where, by trying to do

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.210
so in a way, I don't know, in house,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.510
whatever, the founders have eventually

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.470
seen themselves years later

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.350
in positions that have created

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.950
a huge company but are unprotected,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.550
for example, against funds

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.170
that have entered or that have

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.870
diluted too much because

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.230
I didn't understand the

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.050
mechanism, etc.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.310
It is a process that is nothing

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.030
intuitive, there is no section of

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.330
this that is something that you can

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.630
deduce logically, but you have to

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.130
have the preparation and especially

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:02.990
the experience a little to understand

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.510
the effects that generates doing

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.450
it in one way or do it in another,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.390
because that is why I am in agreement

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.290
with you that you have to go people

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.250
who have, unless they understand

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.250
the procedure well, that you can

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.350
accompany, that you can advise

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.230
you in advance, tend to execute

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.310
it because once it is already

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.870
done, it is a public writing,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.870
it is a public document that is

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.670
written in a record, it is

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.250
nothing that you can change

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.490
suddenly one day for another.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.230
Oh, I was wrong.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.990
No, it does not work that way.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.930
And I will go beyond because it is that,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.230
and I say it because I believe in

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.150
it, and it is that in this case

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.170
you have to turn to professionals,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.590
you do not have your cousin the lawyer,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.630
that is, it has to be people who

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.030
have participated in operations of

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.170
this type, but there are very

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.150
few offices that really have

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.290
experience in this type of

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.230
concrete operations.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.930
is correct.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.650
Yes, yes, in fact, we have found

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.950
ourselves in occasions that we had

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.470
to fix acts that were wrong done,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.670
the calculation was wrong done

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.710
because there was a dictator,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.890
notaries do not dedicate themselves

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.010
to doing that kind of things.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.130
They can advise you but in

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.450
simple operations, that they do day

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.790
by day, but then when you already start

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.950
with things a little more complex,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.550
with valuations and with that kind

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.130
of things, they themselves are

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.390
the first to feel uncomfortable or

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.950
that they do not have the

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.790
preparation, the necessary

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.710
experience to do so, with which

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.710
yes, I think it is worth going

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.710
to a lawyer, in Spain we are

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.750
also cheap, a specialized lawyer.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.950
Yes, even specialized

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.650
lawyers like us, we are not like

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.790
the United States, which are really

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.050
some forgotten concerns,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.490
it's worth coming and asking

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.730
the right people and that's

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.050
not so difficult to find.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.970
This is a chassarrillo, but well,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.810
it is that I want to say it and it is

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.690
that usually people, with lawyers what

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.010
happens and you happen to you is

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.670
that when you have someone in your

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.790
environment who is a lawyer,

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:39.830
it seems that the lawyer does not

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.410
know what he knows, is

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.290
specialized in something, but sure

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.110
they ask you for thousands of things.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.910
I wonder about a separation or

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.870
an inheritance.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.130
If you need to know everything.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.670
It is the same as the mouthpieces,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.190
but of these matters

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.570
yes.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.590
Of course, that's why the advice is

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.430
that for this type of things you turn

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.530
to a desk that is specialized

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.310
in the subject.
