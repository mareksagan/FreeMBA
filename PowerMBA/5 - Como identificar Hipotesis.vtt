00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.910
You may already know the Business

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.310
Model Canvas, which is the

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.970
business model.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.090
It is one of the most important

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.710
tools of business strategy

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.270
and serves us to describe,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.630
analyze and evolve any

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.310
business model.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.270
However, what we’re going to see

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.730
today is an evolution of Canvas and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.590
it’s called Link Canvas and is more

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.730
thought of for innovative business

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.410
models in its early stages.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.030
Because it incorporates a number

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.090
of factors, changes the structure,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.790
removes some of the Canvas factors

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.790
and replaces it with others that

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.330
are, for example, the problem,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.170
the solution, it is much more oriented

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.750
to this, to describe an innovation.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.770


00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.650
I recommend that whenever you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.230
have a new idea, when a new

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.990
project arises, you draw the business

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.270
model, but do so, first do

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.730
it in the Link Canvas because

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
it is easier to describe and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.810
it is easier to analyze that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.890
innovation, identify in this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.030
way what are the main

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.030
hypotheses of that business

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.830
model.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.550
Now you will understand why.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.150
Let’s start by identifying what

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.950
the problem you’re going to solve.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.270
Usually a new proposal is born of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.530
the identification of a problem,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.270
one or several problems that our

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.850
customers have but that we want

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.070
or that has not been achieved

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.730
to give a solution or that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.970
we can give a better solution

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.090
to those problems.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.490
Problems can be of all kinds,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.930
but the larger the problems and

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.970
the more intense those problems

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.530
are, if we are able to give

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.950
a solution, we will have a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.330
larger business.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.550
What we will do also in Link Canvas

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.550
is to describe how our customers

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.030
currently respond to those

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.930
problems, how they solve

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.030
them today.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.270
At this point we also have

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.190
to identify who the customer

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.250
segments we are going

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.130
to address, as in the Visa

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.270
Model Canvas.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.770
What we’re going to do here is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.070
also identify who the Early

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.990
Adopters are.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.790
This is a very important concept.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.950
Early Adopters are very important

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370
because they are your customers

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.030
or the customer segment that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.870
is really waiting for a proposal

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.830
like yours.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.730
Or the segment of customers for

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.610
whom your proposal fits perfectly

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.810
and will help you in many

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.330
things.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.030
They will really help you create

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.070
your product, develop, find

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.170
your business model because

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.250
they are the first customers

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.090
you will have.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.350
You will be able to learn them more easily

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.690
and they will allow you to learn from

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.310
the beginning.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.930
Learn what they need,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.210
how customers act,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.370
etc.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.790
And also, as the first you will go

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.150
to the market with a product that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.450
will not be the final product, but

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.010
will be a minimum viable version,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.910
since Early Adopters are customers

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.490
who judge you less by that level

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.710
of detail because they are

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.550
really waiting for what you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.590
have to offer.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.950
We have already identified

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.970
the problems we want to solve,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.010
we have already identified who

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.530
are the customers who have

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.990
those problems and what we

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.130
have to define is what are

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.650
the solutions we provide

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.690
to each of those problems.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.110
This is how our product solves

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.330
those problems that customers

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.470
have.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.210
From here, what we will do

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.310
is describe our value

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.470
proposition.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.590
As with the Business Model

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.210
Canvas, this central block

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.710
describes what we offer and

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.450
we will try to do it

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.670
in a very clear, simple

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.610
and direct way.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.210
That is, a direct message in which

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.610
we describe what we offer and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.030
why we are different from the rest.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.310
We also have to define, like

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.330
in the Business Model Canvas,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.430
how we will reach our

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.330
customer segment.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.270
What are the distribution

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.550
channels?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.530
How will it be?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.170
We will get through direct, indirect,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.930
inbound, outbound, digital

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.710
marketing channels.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.190
We need to identify

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.610
and describe it.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.070
The incorporation of Link Canvas

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.310
is the block of competitive advantage.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.190
This is very important in innovative models

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.310
and is something that is highly valued.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.670
The fact that you have something

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.650
that can’t easily be copied by

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.630
your potential competitors.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.630
If you can have a strong competitive

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.930
advantage, generate entry barriers,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.010
well, because your business

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.610
model will be much more

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.390
valuable.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.220
All this will obviously generate

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.380
some income flows that we

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.500
have to identify and a cost

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.340
or expenditure structure that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.620
we have to analyze as well.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.900
And finally, another of

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.920
the incorporations of Link Canvas

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.840
is that it helps us identify which

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.380
are or obliges us to identify

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.900
which are the business key metrics.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.700
And they don’t have to be too many

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.060
because it’s preferable to define

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.980
or focus on a few metrics.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.000
And you will learn to identify

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240
them because they are not usually

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.980
traditional, they are not sales, they

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.340
are not the number of customers, but

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.580
it is better to incorporate, especially

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.880
in the initial phases, another

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.180
series of metrics that are

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.240
more representative of customer

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.520
behavior.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.280
Whether customers repeat or not, if

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.740
customers do not recommend to

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.800
others, metrics representative of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.180
value, of the value they are perceiving,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.560
metrics representative

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.660
of what it is hard for us

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.700
to capture a customer, etc.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.860
Well, we will see it in more detail.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.360
As you can see, Link Canvas is a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.380
canvas that is more thought out for

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.980
an innovative business model.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.440
And that helps a lot to

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.340
analyze it, helps a lot to

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.360
have an integral perspective of

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.180
that idea that you have had,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.240
how it is concrete in a business

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.380
model and what are the hypotheses

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.320
that we will have to validate

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.620
from each of the blocks

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.560
to be able to validate

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.380
or to find a business model

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.980
that really makes sense.
