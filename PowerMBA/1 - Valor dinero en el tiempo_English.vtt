00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.390
The value of money over time is a

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.850
basic concept in finance that is very

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.390
intuitive, it is very easy to understand.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.170


00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.350
If you get into this situation, you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.030
have two options.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.950
You can choose between a million

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.630
euros today or a million euros

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.770
in ten years.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890
And here the answer is very easy.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.090
I prefer a million euros today.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.450
And why?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.110
Basically for two reasons.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.670
One, because there will probably

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.390
be inflation in ten years, prices

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.790
will rise and the purchasing

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.750
power of that million euros

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.610
will be lower within ten years.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.790
I prefer it today.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
This is what we call

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.910
the opportunity cost.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.530
If I have a million euros today

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.310
I will get an interest or I

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.450
will get a profit during these

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.110
ten years.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770
If you give me it in ten years, well,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.110
because I’ll miss out on the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.810
opportunity to generate all

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.190
those interests.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.650
This was very easy, but imagine that

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.870
we are putting ourselves in a more

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.430
complex situation and we have to evaluate

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.070
or we have to compare or analyze

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.070
or make decisions by comparing alternatives.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.150
One million euros today, one eats

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.350
four million within receiving a flow

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.510
of two hundred and five thousand

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.470
euros over the next five years.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.230
How do we compare this?

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.970
Because of course, if we compare it like

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:34.730
this, what we are doing is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.210
to compare pears with apples.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.550
What we have to do is calculate

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.810
the present or future value

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.710
of those alternatives.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.830
We have incorporated two very important

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.090
concepts, present value and future

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.370
value, which is very intuitive.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.390
The present value of these three alternatives

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.630
would be the value today of those

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.610
cash flows regardless

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.830
of when they have been generated

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.950
and the future value since it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.430
is the value in this case

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.090
within five years.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.030
What we have to learn is to calculate

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550
those present values or those future

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.990
values and for that we introduce

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.030
two other concepts that is to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.510
capitalize or discount or update,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.610
which are sometimes used

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.710
for cash flows, payments, etc.,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.230
to move them to a future moment

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.390
and discount is the opposite.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.630
In the case we had before, well,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.810
because what we can do is that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.650
million euros we receive

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.170
today, we can capitalize

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.630
it, that now we will see the formula,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.410
to see what is its value within

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.910
five years or vice versa, option

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.790
B one eats four million

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.090
within five years what we are

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.350
doing is through a discount of

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.430
the update of that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.950
amount and we could do the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.190
same with that flow of 205

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.190
thousand euros a year.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.830
We could convert it into a present

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.270
value by discounting those flows or

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.490
we can capitalize them and see what

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.090
the value is within five years.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.090
Now let’s see the formula we use

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.490
both to capitalize and to discount

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.550
because as you will see it

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.770
is the same formula and we

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.490
start with capitalization.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.970
What we want is to calculate

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.650
the future value of a charge,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.210
cash flow, etc., or present

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.830
value.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.550
What we do here is multiply.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.810
Multiply by a capital factor.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.010
As you can see, future value is equal

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.110
to present value by the capitalization factor.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.910
What is this capitalization factor?

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.070
It depends on the type of interest

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.170
that will be generated and the number

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.810
of periods.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.490
And if we do the opposite, what

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.950
we do is update, rather than

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.210
multiply, what we will do is

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.110
divide by that same amount.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.790
In this case it would not be a capitalization

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.850
factor, it would be an upgrade

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.970
or discount factor.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.310
What we will do is discount those

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.650
amounts and as you can see we

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.910
have in mind the same variables

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.230
that are the interest rate

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.210
and the number of periods.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.670
The formula is very simple.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.890
You may not understand it intuitively

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.870
yet, but if we put an example

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.130
and a simple example like

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.270
the one we’ll see, you’

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.730
ll understand it.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.610
We will take everything to the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.930
extreme of simplicity.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.150
There is only one year, there is

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.230
only a period that could be a year, a month,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.850
whatever it is.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.470
In this case, we need to calculate

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.610
the future value.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.130
We know the present value.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.770
The current value is one, one million.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.550
The interest rate is 10%, and the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.170
period is one.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.570
What is the future value?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.350
It is easy, it is easy.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.030
A million, we will multiply by that

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.290
capitalization factor that is 10%,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.770
which would be one with one and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.990
above the period is one.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.990
Very easy, right?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.530
What is the future value in this case?

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.910
It is 1.1 million.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.050
Now we will do the opposite.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.950
We will discount with the same

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.410
type of interest, we have taken

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.830
it forward, we have capitalized

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.590
and we will discount it, we will update it.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.990
We will bring it back, we will bring

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.310
it back to the present moment.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.170
That is 1.1 million.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.310
Remember that the formula was, in

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.390
this case, instead of

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.190
multiplying, what we will

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.610
do is divide.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.230
We will divide the future value

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.850
between that upgrade factor, which

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.210
in this case is the same type of

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.450
interest, we have made a 10%.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.470
Well, then very easy.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.190
What will come out of us?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.810
We will get the same million

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.690
euros.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.130
As you have seen, to capitalize

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.330
what we do is to multiply by

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.750
that capitalization factor

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.170
that depends on the type of

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.430
interest and the number of periods

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.850
and to discount a future value

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.590
or a quantity, whatever, we

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.810
will do the opposite.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.370
We will divide it.
