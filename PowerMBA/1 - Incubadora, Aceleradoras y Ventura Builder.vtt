00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
I would like you to explain to us three concepts or three figures that are very important in

00:15.680 --> 00:21.720
the world of entrepreneurship that I think our students have to know well, which are

00:21.720 --> 00:24.000
an accelerator, a major builder and an incubator.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.280
It is interesting that we know what each of them consists of, for whom, who can resort,

00:32.280 --> 00:35.040
at what moment one must resort to another, what it contributes, etc.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.040
I'm going to ask you questions, okay?

00:37.040 --> 00:41.400
We start, if you like, with an accelerator.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.400
Explain to us what an accelerator is.

00:43.400 --> 00:51.040
I think that as most of our students know, accelerators are entities or companies that

00:51.040 --> 00:56.760
help entrepreneurs, that is, they help startups to carry their project from a

00:56.760 --> 01:00.960
phase, from a more initial phase to a slightly more advanced phase, that is, they usually

01:00.960 --> 01:05.160
help them in the development of the project, they usually accelerate them, that is, they shorten

01:05.160 --> 01:09.720
what in the real world they would have to do in many more months, in very few months,

01:09.720 --> 01:13.320
thanks to providing them with a lot of resources and above all to connect them with investors.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.760
I'm going to ask you, accelerating, is the concept clear?

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
At what time?

01:17.760 --> 01:23.200
That is, I am an entrepreneur, I have a startup, at what time could I start to consider...

01:23.200 --> 01:25.000
That an accelerator is a good option?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.320
I believe that a startup or an entrepreneur should already have a team assembled, it does not have

01:29.320 --> 01:33.040
to go to an accelerator to find a team, there it has to go with the team already made, it has

01:33.040 --> 01:37.840
to go with the product launched, it does not have to go thinking about launching the product

01:37.840 --> 01:41.480
within the acceleration program, but it has to go with the product launched

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
to the market.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.440
Normally, in fact, it is advisable that the product market fit has already been made, that is,

01:48.120 --> 01:51.120
that it has already fitted, that this product has a fit with the market and has some meaning,

01:51.120 --> 01:55.280
and that what the accelerator is going to do is to see how it can scale it, that is, how

01:55.280 --> 01:58.640
can it take advantage of the months of acceleration, which are months in which it will receive a lot

01:58.640 --> 02:05.320
of impacts or help to scale the project, how can it achieve that the metrics

02:05.320 --> 02:09.440
during those months of its business grow, that is, how can it find the growth engine

02:09.440 --> 02:10.680
that makes it start to scale.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.320
What does the accelerator provide?

02:14.320 --> 02:18.440
The first thing that an accelerator provides is a physical space, that is, an acceleration

02:18.440 --> 02:20.200
program is a face-to-face acceleration program.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.520
There is also a variety that is virtual acceleration programs that do not have to happen face-to-face,

02:24.520 --> 02:27.520
I think that most or the most recommended are face-to-face.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.120
So, a physical space that you share with other projects that are inside the accelerator.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.520
Normally, an accelerator accelerates between 5 and 10 projects at the same time.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.880
In the United States there are very large accelerators, such as Y Combinator, which is the largest

02:39.880 --> 02:45.080
in the world, which accelerates up to 100 projects simultaneously within the same building,

02:45.080 --> 02:50.080
but the key is that you are going to be those 3, 4, even 6 months inside the same space

02:50.080 --> 02:51.080
with other projects.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.720
What else does the accelerator provide you?

02:52.720 --> 02:56.760
It normally provides you with access to mentors who will participate throughout the acceleration

02:56.760 --> 03:01.120
program, they will give you training, those mentors, and they will be available for you

03:01.120 --> 03:04.800
to consult or help you with all the doubts you have with the business.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.800
And the last thing that an accelerator provides, which I think is one of the fundamental things,

03:09.800 --> 03:12.000
is the help to get investment.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
That is, an accelerator invests or must invest in the beginning of the acceleration program,

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
that is, once you have been selected among all the companies that are appointed,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
they have to invest a ticket.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
In Spain, the truth is that the money that is invested in accelerators is usually quite small,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
that is, there are accelerators that either do not invest or invest 5 or 10 thousand euros,

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
there are others that do invest 15, 25 thousand euros, even some that invest 40 to 100 thousand,

03:37.200 --> 03:41.200
which are usually corporate accelerators that have a corporate behind them.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.200
In other words, they really do dedicate resources, they dedicate a lot of resources because you

03:45.200 --> 03:47.200
told me mentors, assistants, etc.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.200
And then in some cases they help you with some money.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.200
In other words, it is a little money, but they should allocate some economic resources.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.200
The last thing that you, as an entrepreneur, the last thing that the accelerator provides you,

04:00.200 --> 04:03.200
which is one of the fundamental things for which many entrepreneurs, many startups,

04:03.400 --> 04:07.400
who join an acceleration program, is for what is called the investor day or the demo day.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
That is like the big day of the accelerator, that is, after the entire acceleration process,

04:10.400 --> 04:15.400
the last day that the projects have been growing within the accelerator and improving their metrics,

04:15.400 --> 04:18.400
they make a pitch or a presentation in front of investors.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.400
Then the accelerator summons all the investors that it has around it to come to that presentation,

04:23.400 --> 04:27.400
because there are accelerators that can bring you 50 or 100 investors to see the presentations

04:27.400 --> 04:31.400
and you as an entrepreneur will have 5 minutes to tell your project,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
explain what you have achieved within the acceleration program,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.600
how your metrics have improved and why you are the ideal project

04:36.600 --> 04:38.600
among all those who present it for you to invest.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.600
The good thing is that among the investors who go to an investor day or a demo day,

04:41.600 --> 04:47.600
there are business angels who are investors on a personal basis, even investment funds.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.600
You have a lot of players who can invest in you at that time.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.600
And that may be the fundamental thing, that you have to be focused

04:53.600 --> 04:57.600
to finish the acceleration program with a first round of investment.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.800
I understand that during the acceleration program you have been provided with many resources,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.800
but not so much in terms of money.

05:05.800 --> 05:10.800
Of course, the financing of that growth to achieve those metrics

05:10.800 --> 05:13.800
has to come from the startup itself.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.800
I think the ideal thing is to propose, just according to what you say,

05:16.800 --> 05:21.800
when a startup applies to an acceleration program or wants to enter an acceleration program,

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
the important thing is that it is well prepared.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It is not that the phase will be ideal, that is, that you come with the team,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
that you have already launched the product, that that product has already fitted with the market,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
but it is good that you go with some money.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It is not good to reach the acceleration program only with the money that the accelerator puts you,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
but it is quite positive that you have already been able to do a round of Friend, Family and Fools,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
that is, a first round that is usually called Pre-seed, that is, prior to the seed capital,

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
in which with the first 25,000 or 50,000 euros you can invest them during the acceleration program

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
to grow faster than the rest of the startups of the program.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
A very important thing is that if you are in an acceleration program,

05:55.200 --> 06:00.200
you do not only compete against your competitors in your market or against all startups in general,

06:00.200 --> 06:04.200
but you have the startups of the acceleration program that also have the same goal as you,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
which is to get investment at the end of the program.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
So it is good that you differentiate yourself having some money that you have previously achieved.

06:10.200 --> 06:17.200
One last question I have regarding an accelerator is what percentage of equity is left to the accelerator?

06:17.200 --> 06:22.200
This is very variable, that is, in fact here I also explain to you that there are different types of accelerators,

06:22.400 --> 06:26.400
there are public accelerators, which are usually accelerators linked to municipalities

06:26.400 --> 06:30.400
or to different public entities, which usually do not have equity,

06:30.400 --> 06:35.400
but for me, although it is important that the entrepreneur defends the equity of his startup well

06:35.400 --> 06:39.400
and dilutes it as little as possible, but it is not positive when an accelerator does not have equity

06:39.400 --> 06:42.400
because that means that it will not be involved with your project in the future.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.400
Public accelerators have 0% equity, for example.

06:45.400 --> 06:50.400
Then you have corporate accelerators, which are usually sponsored, sponsored

06:50.600 --> 06:56.600
or even mounted directly by a corporate that puts the money and that usually sometimes

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
puts even significantly more money.

06:58.600 --> 07:03.600
In this case, equity exists from... they are usually vertical accelerators of a single sector,

07:03.600 --> 07:07.600
which is the sector in which that corporate is, and sometimes from nothing left of equity

07:07.600 --> 07:13.600
until a 7, 8, 10% is left, and then there are private accelerators,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
which are the majority and the most recommended.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.800
In private accelerators, the main key is that they do invest money,

07:19.800 --> 07:23.800
they do get more involved in the project, they do have an interest and they take a percentage.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.800
The percentage of an accelerator usually oscillates between 5 and 15,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
so very, very wide.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.800
Perhaps the most common in Spain is between 7 and 10%.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
Okay, perfect.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.800
Okay? That would be a bit the range in which accelerators move.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.800
Well, I think we already have the photo of what an accelerator is.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
Let's go to the Venture Builder.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
Okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Venture Builder is something radically different from an accelerator,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
but let's say that they are players, that is, they are entities that are in the same sector, more or less.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
A Venture Builder, the difference is that the protagonist is not the entrepreneur

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
or the startup that enters a Venture Builder.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
A Venture Builder does not reach an entrepreneur with a project already developed, with an idea,

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
but a Venture Builder is the Venture Builder or that entity, that player,

08:11.200 --> 08:15.200
the one who decides to develop their own projects or their own ideas.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.200
And what it does is that it looks for entrepreneurs or intra-entrepreneurs

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
who want to carry them out.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.200
And what it does is that those entrepreneurs are usually paid a salary

08:23.200 --> 08:28.200
and the Venture Builder finances the party, that is, it finances the development of the project,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.200
not only during the first months, but during the life of the startup,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
at least during the first two years.

08:33.200 --> 08:39.200
How much percentage, in this case, following the sequence of what we talked about before with the accelerators,

08:39.400 --> 08:40.400
does a Venture Builder stay?

08:40.400 --> 08:43.400
A Venture Builder always stays in the majority percentage of companies.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.400
It is very different from an entrepreneur who wants to keep his majority percentage.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.400
In this case, the majority percentage will be given to the Venture Builder

08:50.400 --> 08:54.400
or rather, the Venture Builder will give him a very small percentage,

08:54.400 --> 08:59.400
but normally, in return, he will be given a salary with which he will take less risk when it comes to entrepreneurship.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.400
Examples of Venture Builders, for example,

09:03.400 --> 09:06.400
are usually in the orbit of a successful entrepreneur

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
who has already succeeded in setting up a company

09:08.600 --> 09:12.600
and who decides to set up this Venture Builder to support several projects simultaneously.

09:12.600 --> 09:18.600
In Spain, for example, it is well known that Antai was set up by Miguel Vicente

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
and Gerard Olivier too.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.600
Miguel Vicente had sold Let's Bonus and decided to set up Antai

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
to be able to set up several projects, promote them,

09:25.600 --> 09:29.600
and they, as majority, finance the projects and get involved a lot in the companies.

09:29.600 --> 09:35.600
In fact, usually a Venture Builder not only finances a company,

09:35.800 --> 09:37.800
but also puts more resources, not only economically,

09:37.800 --> 09:43.800
but many times he is in charge of the web development of the company's first phases,

09:43.800 --> 09:47.800
sometimes he even invests in technological tools that he has previously developed.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.800
That is, the projects that are inside the Venture Builder,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.800
as they are for much longer and are owned by the Venture Builder,

09:53.800 --> 09:56.800
are more synergistic with each other and share more resources in common.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.800
It is very common, for example, in a Venture Builder,

09:58.800 --> 10:02.800
that a same service CTO has two companies

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
and not that there is a company with its own CTO.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I think it is an intra-entrepreneurial model.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, basically this is, someone has made a success,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
has earned a lot of money and what he wants is to continue creating companies,

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
create a Venture Builder that, let's say, includes, that launches many projects,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
the talent, he hires it in some way,

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
what happens is that those entrepreneurs are given a percentage of equity,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
which I don't know how much it will be.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, I think it depends a little, that is, it is always in minorities,

10:34.200 --> 10:40.200
that is, to give an example, a Venture Builder can stay from 51% to 60-70%.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.200
In Spain we have, as I said, Antay, there is also Nucleo,

10:43.200 --> 10:46.200
there is Sonar Ventures, there is another series of Venture Builders.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.200
At the world level, the best known is Rocket Internet,

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
which is possibly one of the largest players in world-wide entrepreneurship,

10:53.200 --> 10:57.200
which is listed with more than 3 billion euros of capitalization in the stock market.

10:57.200 --> 11:02.200
And therefore, if they stay between 51% and 70%,

11:02.400 --> 11:06.400
then the entrepreneurs will have that other 30-40%.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.400
And if that 30-40% is distributed between 2, 3, 4 co-founders,

11:10.400 --> 11:14.400
then each co-founder can have between 5 and 15%.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.400
That is, the percentage is lower for the entrepreneur,

11:18.400 --> 11:22.400
that 5-15% of what he could have if he sets up his own company and enters a Venture Builder.

11:22.400 --> 11:29.400
The risk is a thousand times lower, the support he receives is gigantic, there are synergies, etc.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.600
It is not comparable, they are two totally different models.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.600
What happens is that it is very important that an entrepreneur knows what he is heading.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.600
Ok, let's go with incubators.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.600
Ok, incubators, for me, are a different model from the previous ones.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.600
I think it is a hybrid between both.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.600
In this case, Demium, which is my company, is a startup incubator.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.600
Here, the projects enter an initial phase within the incubator,

11:53.600 --> 11:58.600
let's say it would be a phase almost zero, or even from zero,

11:58.800 --> 12:00.800
unlike accelerators, which, as we said before,

12:00.800 --> 12:02.800
entered after the Product Market Feed,

12:02.800 --> 12:06.800
already with a first round of investment of Friend, Family and Pools closed,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
and with the goal of scaling.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.800
Here, incubator projects enter the most initial moment.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
What can an entrepreneur look for in an accelerator?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.800
An entrepreneur in an accelerator, what he is usually looking for is

12:16.800 --> 12:23.800
to access a methodology that cuts the time that has to pass in the initial phases,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
he usually wants to access a series of mentors,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
as was the case before we talked about the accelerator.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Usually, the incubator has a dedicated team that works with the projects.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
That dedicated team, in our case, we are 15 people in the Demium team,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
because we are in Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
and therefore we have a team that is dedicated in the three headquarters

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
working full-time with the projects,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
and usually there is a slightly higher level of involvement than with the accelerators.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Less projects are worked in parallel,

12:51.200 --> 12:53.200
but perhaps the difference, as I said before,

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
a hybrid and the difference with a Venture Builder

12:55.200 --> 12:58.200
is that the percentage is majority of the entrepreneur.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.200
That is, the incubator has a minority percentage.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.200
In our case, our percentage is 15%,

13:03.200 --> 13:07.200
but there are other incubators that even reach up to 25% of the capital,

13:07.200 --> 13:10.200
but always in the minority, not just a Venture Builder.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.200
So, apart from a methodology of advising,

13:13.200 --> 13:17.200
of a team that helps you develop or advises you to develop the project,

13:17.200 --> 13:19.200
they usually help you get investment,

13:19.400 --> 13:22.400
it is rarer that an incubator invests you from the moment zero,

13:22.400 --> 13:25.400
but usually they invest you at the end of the incubation program,

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
because unlike accelerators,

13:27.400 --> 13:30.400
in accelerators the projects are already a little more marked,

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
more developed,

13:31.400 --> 13:35.400
in incubators we are talking about entrepreneurs arriving with a PowerPoint,

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
or even, as in our case in Demium,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.400
they arrive to look for co-founders for their project

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
and to develop the idea from scratch.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
Therefore, investing from the moment one,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
the day zero, would be a lot of risk,

13:45.400 --> 13:48.400
so it is normal to invest at the end of the incubation program.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.600
So, the financing of the search for the product market fit,

13:54.600 --> 13:56.600
etc., that is done by the entrepreneur.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.600
That is, the financing of being inside an incubator

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
is usually done by the entrepreneur.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.600
Here there is no salary, as in Venture Builder,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.600
because in Venture Builder they give you a salary

14:06.600 --> 14:08.600
and therefore you do not take so much risk,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.600
and you do not have an initial investment from day one

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
with which you can finance growth,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
as is the case with the accelerator,

14:15.800 --> 14:17.800
you do not have to go through the first phase on your own

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
before entering the accelerator.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.800
Here you come into a shared space with other projects...

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
You open the offices...

14:22.800 --> 14:24.800
At the end you provide offices,

14:24.800 --> 14:27.800
you provide those resources of advice, mentoring,

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
a training program,

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
in our case we do a very intensive training program

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
of 100 hours for 16 weeks

14:32.800 --> 14:35.800
to give it all the training layer it needs

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
before launching its product to the market,

14:37.800 --> 14:40.800
that is, those 16 weeks are prior to the launch of the product to the market.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.800
I think the most important thing is to understand

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
in which phase each one enters.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
An incubator would enter phase 0

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
from the moment an idea or a team begins to exist

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
that wants to start working on a project,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
an accelerator would enter the next phase,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
that is, when the product is already launched in the market

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and what the project wants is to scale.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Therefore, the investment must enter

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
at the end of the incubation process

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
or at the beginning of the acceleration process.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
That would be the intersection point.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
If you go to a Venture Builder,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
what it covers is from the beginning,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
from the zero moment of the idea,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.200
because the idea is set by the Venture Builder,

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
the team configuration, everything,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.200
and the company is usually financed

15:19.200 --> 15:21.200
for at least two years,

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
sometimes even for the rest of the company's life.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
One last question,

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
in incubators, who sets the idea?

15:28.200 --> 15:31.200
That depends a lot on the incubators.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.200
For example, in Spain

15:36.200 --> 15:39.200
there is an incubator called Incubio,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.200
where the idea is usually brought by the entrepreneur,

15:41.400 --> 15:43.400
there are many other incubators

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
where the entrepreneur goes with his own idea.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
In our case, in Demium,

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
it is Demium together with the entrepreneur,

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
once the team is set up,

15:52.400 --> 15:55.400
we look for the idea together.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.400
That is, what we do is that we look for

15:57.400 --> 15:59.400
a business idea with the entrepreneur

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
that is based on a trend that is successful in another market.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
Our model, Demium's,

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
also exists in other countries,

16:05.400 --> 16:07.400
it is very similar, or in a simultaneous way

16:07.400 --> 16:09.400
other players have also emerged in other countries,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.600
for example, in the UK

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
there is a player called Entrepreneur First,

16:13.600 --> 16:15.600
which is also a model where

16:15.600 --> 16:17.600
ideas are sought within the incubator,

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
that is, once you are inside the incubation program,

16:19.600 --> 16:21.600
you arrive at the incubation program

16:21.600 --> 16:23.600
with the intention of undertaking,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.600
but still without carrying an idea under your arm,

16:25.600 --> 16:27.600
that is, with the intention that in the first month

16:27.600 --> 16:29.600
you dedicate it to identifying what is the business opportunity

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
that you most deserve to bet on.
