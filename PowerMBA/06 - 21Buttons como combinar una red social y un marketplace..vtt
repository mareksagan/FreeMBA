00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Marc, your business model has a particularity.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
It combines two business models within the platforms.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
The social network, which mainly provides value through the network effect

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
generated by users and the content that users share on social networks,

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
and the Instagram, which are the users and the photos.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
But it is combined with a marketplace model.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
I think this is unique in this sector and I imagine it has a series of advantages that I would like to highlight.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, I think it is a very unique model in the fashion sector.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
A model in which there are things that are similar in other sectors, not the same.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
That have combined social networks with…

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
That have combined, maybe not social networks, but user-generated content.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
For example, there is the House model in the United States,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
which is a company worth 4 billion, 40 million users a month,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
where it has user-generated content because users play it,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
but they are mainly professionals, it is not so much social network.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
But you asked me what the advantages are, and I would start with the disadvantage.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
For us it is also a challenge, because you do not have a straight line.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
There are many models, I copy this business model from a player in the United States,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I'm going to do it in some countries in southern Europe,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
and I look at it, it's like a mirror, and I'm doing it here,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
shaping the product a little to your market.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
In our case, you do not have a straight line, you have a world…

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Because you created it, it is innovation.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Exactly, and with which you do not have a straight line, but you are trying to validate in the long run,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
and that is every day, validating your hypotheses about your goal.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I think the important thing is to have a goal,

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
to see if your changes you make in the product, in the strategy, are aligned with that goal.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Because if not, a model like ours, where you do not have a path to follow,

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
would be totally crazy, we would be piloting every day, and we would not get what we want.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Indeed, that is the disadvantage, because you have opened the way and you have no one to look at.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Exactly, the advantage is that we are the first,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
with which you can get close to the market if you know how to do it well.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
The second advantage is that it is a model that at first, if it is true,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
that from investors, has more risk, because you can not compare what is good and what is bad,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
but when you can show that you are doing it well,

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
everyone is interested, or many people are interested in investing in something unique,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
because it can become something bigger.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And finally, the advantage is, or one of the last, is at the market level.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
In the end, I am not competing with other players in the markets,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and I do not have to go and get a position that I had another.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
In this sense, we are the first to open that market,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
it is also true that it costs more because you have to explain what the product is,

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
and people do not know, but then the user, you have it and it is very complicated for others.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
What you are talking about now is not the whole business model,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
but it is a bit of the positioning of the value proposition.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Of course, as it is new, it is more difficult than in a minute you explain it to me,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
because if I do not know it, it requires more details than when it is something that I already know,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
that I already buy it to another.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
If we do the analysis of the business model very quickly,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
and we are the two consultants and we do it well,

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
if we compare it with a mix of a social network and a marketplace,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
if we compare it only with a social network,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I think, but you can correct me,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
that the advantage is that when incorporating the marketplace,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
you have been able to monetize and earn money much earlier than if it were only a social network.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Each one has its business model,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
in the sense that it is true that we have become a social network,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
that we can monetize both at the advertising level,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
as is the business model on Instagram, Facebook, etc.,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
and we add the transactionality part,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
that is very good because you have those two channels,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
and many more open that it is not necessary to enter,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
but we have those two options when a social network does not have it.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Is it an advantage?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Yes, because the value proposition is good for the user,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
we could have a social network with shopping,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
but the product itself does not fit with the user.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes, but now forgetting a little about the value proposition,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
but only from the point of view of income flows,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I think it is an advantage with respect to the social network,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and if we compare it only with the marketplace,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
when incorporating the social network, what you get is more engagement.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Exactly, in the end what we have is a marketplace as a business,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
but where users, and that each one sees it as a social network,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
and it is true, and we want users to see 21Buttons as a social network,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
and we want it to be like that, that 21Buttons continues to be a social network,

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
because this brings you virality, this brings you much more engagement, etc.,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
it does not mean that neither business is better nor worse than another,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
in the end you have to measure your lifetime value,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
you have to measure your CAC and see if the numbers come out or not,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
they could not come out either, even if it is 21Buttons,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
imagine that users do not buy, it does not help you at all,

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
but that is the idea, to try to create a viral model

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
with the good part of buying and transactionality charging.
