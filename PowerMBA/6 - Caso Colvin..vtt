00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.840
AndrÃ©s, the case of Colvin I think

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.960
it is a book case in the sense of,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.160
if we analyze it from the perspective

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.820
of the book, being redundant,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.280
of the blue ocean strategy, that

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.160
I know you don't know it, I'll

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.040
give it because it's wonderful,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.780
but it's that it explains very

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.560
well and I'm going to do is

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.320
that I'm going to explain

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.220
what the blue ocean strategy

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.020
proposes us and you cut me

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.560
and tell me exactly

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720
where we identify,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.480
right?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.580
Yes indeed.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.260
The blue ocean strategy tells

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.960
us that we must stop thinking about

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.740
competing only in being cheaper

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.640
or having a lower cost structure

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.820
or being better and that we can look

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.520
for a very important concept that

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.700
they call is value innovation,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.740
which is to offer more value

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.080
to the customer at a lower cost

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.040
for the company that can impact

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.720
the value of the product.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.400
That is why I think it is super

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.900
interesting.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.760
That is, if we had focused

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.100
on this from the beginning, how

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.420
do I compete with companies that

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.340
are much bigger than us,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.540
that charge millions and millions

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.480
of euros of marketing

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.040
budgets?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.460
You are clinging your face to a wall.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.180
This is what they call the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.940
Red Ocean.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.760
Of course, get into the pit where

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.000
everyone is watching them attack

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.680
the next-hand fish to compete.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.340
We thought the first thing

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.440
we had to solve were

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.960
the problems the user had.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.160
How can we solve these problems?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.260
Thinking differently,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.780
innovating, as you said in

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.740
the value proposal to the user.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.200
What problems did the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.460
user have?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.500
Price, this is expensive.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.740
Quality is short.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.700
I don't like to buy it to a brand

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.840
that does things the same

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.760
way it did 30 years ago.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.920
How can we solve that?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.640
What I'm trying to say is that we are

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.400
going backwards.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.820
That is where the model was designed.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.260
We do not work in reverse.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.720
We don't work the way we're

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.380
saying, this works like this, ABCDE,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.860
let's get in and see what happens.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.300


00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.760
The question is, did you come from

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.340
the industry?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.660
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.700
We're seeing it with many successful

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.400
entrepreneurs coming from completely

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.900
different industries.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.860
Also, I often recommend a curious

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280
thing, that you don't pay attention

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.200
to, that if you have an idea

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720
in the flower business, don't pay

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.000
attention to the floral experts,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.380
because they are contaminated.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.080
They are cisgated.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.440
And we saw it from the beginning,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.840
that the industry, we from the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.400
beginning, already thought it would

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.340
change someone who wasn't inside,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.780
because they are cisgated

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.280
and I think it's normal.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.500
You have a way of seeing the world.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.340
That is.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.660
We were coming from... They are

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.000
put on the PC, you can't talk about

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.560
anything else.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.880
Marc works in marketing, at a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.180
pharmacy, Sergi works at Amazon

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.100
and I work in an investment bank.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.080
We do not have much knowledge of the sector.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.980
We are going to continue with

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.760
the Blue Ocean Strategy.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.120
We are told that innovation in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.760
values, more value at a lower cost.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020
How do you get more value, like that in bullets?

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.860
More value at a lower cost.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.860
And more value.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.020
Why do you offer more value than your competitors?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.160
Because you are more competitive in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.700
price, because your flowers last longer.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.620
Well, but the competing in price,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.440
well, that's what we leave for... That

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.600
is, more value, because you generate

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.720
more absolute value, not because

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.620
you are cheaper, but you generate

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.160
more absolute value, regardless

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.280
of the price.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.740
That is, even if I cost the same, I will

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.720
buy at Colby, which in your competitors

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.100
I would buy, and it's actually a very

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.520
good point, because it doesn't have

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.360
much to do with it.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.740
In other words, one of the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.440
things we have put a lot

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.600
of focus on is the user

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.260
experience.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.900
What is the promise of service

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.820
I make to you?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.020
How do you trust us?

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.780
How do you know that it will go without

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.200
any problems?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.400
When I get there, I'll send you a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.660
WhatsApp message to ask if you'

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.100
re okay.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.540
If it doesn't work well, I'll

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.680
return the branch for free or I'll

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.280
return the money.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.280
The user experience

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.960
is crucial.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.480
Brand building has been crucial.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.420
So how can you create an

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.340
identity sign?

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.400
That is, a way of thinking,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.380
a way of communicating

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.820
that makes people want to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.740
follow you.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.460
That means people feel identified

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.140
with what you do.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.420
And not with the product, the brand

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.360
has nothing to do with the product.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.900
It is super important that branding

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900
is a way of seeing life, of doing

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.040
things, of understanding what

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.980
we do every day.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
It has to filter everything.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.080
And I think there is and it seems that

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.700
you lie that I tell you, that I know

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.540
you for half an hour, but you are

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.880
forgetting one very important and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.340
it is that you generate much more

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.800
value.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.960
One of the main values is that your

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960
flowers last longer.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.680
Yes, yes yes yes

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.200
No, of course.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.340
That is related to the whole part

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.340
we talked about before, of vertical

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.740
integration to the grower, which

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.140
allows you to make your flowers

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.580
last much longer.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.500
What you buy first and generate

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500
more value, is clear.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.500
And also, even lower cost for the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.140
company because you're connecting

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.540
directly to buyers with the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.600
mines.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.020
The six intermediaries we talked about

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.140
before disappear or look very different.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.100


00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.820
So for now, it is a book.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.080
But in addition, the Blue Ocean

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.020
strategy tells us that we have

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.820
to think that to create a new

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.540
market, a new market space in which

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.540
you do not compete with others,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.500
you have to think about no customers

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.960
or you have that you can't

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.920
target exactly the same

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.160
market as the others.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.180
And I think you have succeeded.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.920
Look, that is very curious.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.480
In other words, our majority

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.880
of audience, curiously, are

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.480
women, not men.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.480
You would have imagined this was

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.420
a product of man to woman.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.280
We addressed women.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.560
Again, why then?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.140
If we are to make men...

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.280
In the traditional market,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.640
buyers are mainly men.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.600
Yes yes of course.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.560
It is something that men

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.320
give to women.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.620
That is, it is clear that they are not customers.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.540
They are not customers, they are not customers.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.840
That is, there were customers, there

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.100
were no women who gave flowers from

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.420
time to time, but clearly this is not

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.880
the case of conventional use.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.580
The case of conventional use is

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.180
man to woman, birthday, Valentine'

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.280
s Day, these things.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.540
Yes, yes yes yes

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.400
We addressed a public that

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.720
had a specific need, that is,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.800
who wanted to feel more

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.400
connected, closer to

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.960
their friends, family...

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.240
Regarding non-customers is very

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.740
clear, but I would say that your

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.620
level of non-customers is higher

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.360
yet because, in addition to how

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.940
women are, I think more than

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.300
no clients is no use.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.600
That is, you have managed,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.720
by putting a much lower price,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.220
that we are going to give flowers

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.400
much more frequently.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.260
Much more recurring.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.480
It is no longer just...

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.740
No, no, there are a lot of triangles here.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.440
That is, triangulate the quality,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.900
service, brand, technological

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.500
product with...

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.980
And all that results in a change

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.200
in the way customers use

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200
the product.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.700
Of course, in fact.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.900
In the end, if you are able

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.340
to offer a much more competitive

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.260
product in price, which lasts

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.900
much longer, that is, the time

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.720
in which I can enjoy the product

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.360
is much longer, I buy it in

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.700
a brand with which I feel identified.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.840
The way to compare it is super simple.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.340
New uses appear.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.960
Of course, in fact.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.500
Small moments of use, of course.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.360
That is.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.880
Before I went to dinner and married some friends

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.180
and went out and maybe I didn't do anything,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.760
didn't I?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.260
Now I get up in the taxi, I touch a

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.760
phone twice and I send some flowers

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.520
that arrive the next day that I know

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.680
they come to me in quality with

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.260
excellent service, with a brand that

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.720
accompanies it, with much greater

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.340
durability and above a much

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.340
more competitive price.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.040
It is bestial.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.020
And that generates...

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.440
It has destabilized the industry.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.240
That is, something that was

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240
for once in life begins to be

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.600
for all the time.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.220
and already.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.960
In fact, this is not the case of non-

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.300
use.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.580
We'll help our students visualize

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.840
what happens when you

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.180
create a blue ocean.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.020
You created it without knowing that

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.820
it was called so, but you created it.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.740
You have come out of that red ocean

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.380
where hundreds of competitors

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.300
are getting toothed, competing

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.340
for every euro...

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.420
In the price.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.460
With the tight margins and so, you

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.740
created your blue ocean.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.120
What is what happens?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.000
What are the opportunities when you

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.740
create a blue ocean?

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.280
Well, I think it is very interesting.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.160
In the end, you can disable...

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.100
I think that's the only way, frankly.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.920
Getting into competition in a price-

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.040
oriented environment, very

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.400
complex, won't lead you to the

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.960
company work, because you're getting

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960
in front of uncles who are

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.720
much more enthusiastic,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.880
with many more resources.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.580
actually is.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.460
If there are barriers to entry,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.540
you can't directly enter an

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:32.920
ocean.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.000
For example, here there are capital

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.060
entry barriers to be able to compete.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.060
You're not a lot of marketing

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.340
money, for example, or a lot of

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.840
money to be able to invest in technology.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.580
I think that the fact of creating

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.420
this blue ocean, this concept,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.600
is fundamental for any project

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.320
that you start to find that possibility

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.340
of innovation in value.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.760
We have a course in

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.920
Power MBA.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.580
A course is blue ocean strategy

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.680
because we trust the philosophy

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.060
and tools, which are basically

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380
the ones we've talked about,

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.240
is easier for you to think of

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.880
this way.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.860
You have come into being in an innate way.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.280
But once you have the register, it'

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.460
s easier to find it.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.000
without doubt.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.380
Understanding the concept is

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.420
very important to be able, once

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.400
understood, to see how that

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.800
is replicable to different sectors or needs.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.780
It is very, very, very important, I think.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.580
We have more or less intuition.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.660
But I think having a solid knowledge

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.280
of all these concepts makes the

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.660
process easier.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.360
actually is.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.240
I sometimes say that to innovate, that

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.320
is, to create an innovative

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.140
business, you don't need to be creative.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.740
If you are creative, phenomenal,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.440
but it is easier if you build

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.880
from knowing the models, from

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.940
having analyzed other success

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.060
cases, because in things comes

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.100
a time when they fit.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.180
Yes yes.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.260
We did that exercise, in fact,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.780
very early, when we started

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.160
riding Colvin.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.020
There were other similar business

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.460
models in other countries that

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.680
are not exactly the same, but

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.680
they were beginning to cover

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.660
those needs that users had,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.640
those problems they encountered,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.880
trying to buy flowers

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.500
online.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.480
And we tried to extract different

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.600
pieces from here that then, when

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.840
we united them, worked for

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.880
the Spanish market.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.180
Yes yes.
