WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.120
As you already know, with the aim

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.520
of attracting visits or generating

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.580
traffic, we can opt for a series

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.000
of channels or tools or platforms

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.820
that we have classified

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.000
in Outbound or Inbound.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.660
Well, the companies what we

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.740
do at the end is select a series

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.140
of channels, that is, at the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.620
end we have a mix and that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.040
mix is what should help

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.160
us our goals.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.000
And what I want to share today is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200
the criteria, the ten criteria, is

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.300
a model that we have created at

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.060
The Power MBA, with which companies

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040
in reality select which

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.980
channels we use and which

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.340
channels do not, with which

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.440
companies ultimately create

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.620
that mix of what you were talking

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.220
about.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.800
I want you to know that the theory

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600
of digital marketing what it tells

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.960
us is that the main criterion is the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.700
return on investment and this

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.020
is not true.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.680
It may be the most important one, but

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300
there are many more factors that together,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.780
which is what we're going to see,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.700
determine what kind of channels

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.080
you're going to use and which

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.660
not.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.040
The first one is the customer.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.640
After all, the most important

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.920
thing is that you have to understand

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.460
very well your customer person

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.620
who is, what does, what media consultation,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.620
etc., and you will use the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.360
channels that are most suitable

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.560
for your customer person.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.760
It is common sense.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.060
The second is if in addition to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.400
that in our client we can

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.800
effectively reach our customer

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.960
from that channel, if we can also

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.500
segment it.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.160
Why is it?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.040
Because as we can segment more and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.860
more, the return will be greater,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.600
the risk will be lower, and so on.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.860
There are channels that allow

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.660
you to segment a lot, like

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.560
Facebook, for example, and there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.740
are channels that allow you to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.100
segment a lot, like if we put

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.380
an ad on television.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.780
Man, we can choose the time and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.540
other things, but basically the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.100
segmentation is very scarce.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.760
The third of the criteria is ROI,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.720
which is actually one of the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.680
main, is how much we will get

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.040
to that investment.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.540
By the way, there is another criterion

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.980
that is that to some extent the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.340
channel contributes to awareness

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280
to being a known brand or branding.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.920
This is not because, this is sometimes

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.300
separated from short-term return

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.100
or ROI, because it is a slightly

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.460
different goal, but it may

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.680
be that interests us.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.740
This is something we must take into account.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.800
It is possible that a channel we know

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.600
that it will not have a short-term

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.820
return, we do not know when it will

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.440
have it, but that what we are interested

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.700
at that time is to be a well-

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.280
known brand.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.080
And then we opt for that channel,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.560
even though in other criteria

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.800
like ROI, the rating

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.240
may not be good.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.160
The fifth factor is very important

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.560
and is something to be taken into

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600
account and that is evaluated in a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600
very complementary way with return,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.300
with ROI.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.280
It is the scale, it is the volume, it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.260
is the scalability.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.840
What do I mean by this?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.940
You take into account the following.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.780
I'll put you a case where we do a campaign

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.380
with an influencer, for example,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.600
and the return is very high.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.600
It is the biggest we have ever had.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.420
However, it turns out that that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.880
company can only resort to that influencer,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.180
because there are no more influencers

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.100
in that area, related

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.920
to that service.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.320
So, of course, the scope or scalability

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.000
of this campaign or channel

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.740
for this company is very

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.660
low.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.320
Look, you also have to hire

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.740
the influencer, prepare the campaign,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.300
etc., and it is a very punctual

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.600
campaign.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.660
What I'm going to do is that

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.040
scale or scalability is very important

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.140
because we have to find

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.460
our growth engine.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.720
Then you have to look for

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.540
or prioritize channels that

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.500
allow you to grow as much

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.040
as possible and your growth

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.740
goals.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.960
And it's true that there may be other

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.020
channels that have a higher return,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.820
but that will take you more

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.920
effort.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.340
Why is it?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.340
Because it is that you will have to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.640
be constantly changing, because they

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.160
don't have the ability to escalate

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.940
with you.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.660
Another criterion is immediate, which

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.460
could be the payback.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.980
This is a very important

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.720
part of the outbound

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.540
and inbound channel.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.520
Usually, when they are outbound channels

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.400
and they are paid channels, the immediate

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.480
is greater.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.520
We pay, invest money and

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760
traffic grows quickly or

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.800
leads grow or sales grow.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.340
Inbound strategies have a more medium-

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.420
term return, which in the end what

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.240
it does is, after that medium-

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.740
term you have a generation

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.320
of traffic at a very sustainable

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.420
cost and more.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.120
But you really have to take that into

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.560
account.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.760
If your inbound channels are

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.420
channels, you will prioritize channels

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.400
primarily outbound.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.280
Another factor to consider is the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.840
minimum investment that some channels

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.120
require.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.120
You can invest 25 euros on

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.060
Facebook, but there are platforms

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.980
where you have to invest 10,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.780
000 euros to get started.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.400
Well, then if you are not

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.920
capitalized enough, it is that directly

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
those platforms that

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.820
require you a greater investment,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.620
because you will leave

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.380
them out.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.960
They may be attractive to you,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.420
but you won't be able to cope with it.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.700
And another factor that

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.760
is related, but not the same,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.680
is the risk that is assumed with

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.700
that investment.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.540
The risk depends mainly on

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.260
the cost model.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.400
I will give you two contradictory examples.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.360
We can compare doing a television campaign

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.960
in which you spend 100,000 euros and

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.600
you don't know what will happen to

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.360
the most performance models,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.920
especially to the extreme that

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.960
would be if you make an agreement

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.100
with someone with a certain

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.280
channel and charge you for customer

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.440
acquisition.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.280
It's completely variable,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560
fully aligned with your goals.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.160
I've given you two extreme examples,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.720
but I want you to understand

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.800
the difference.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.320
In the end, all companies

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.300
are looking for channels that have

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.680
the most variable cost possible

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.680
because the risk is lower.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.160
Another very important factor is that

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.220
there are channels or platforms that

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.360
help you, accompany the customer

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.640
along the entire funnel.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.100
This is a great advantage.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.320
It is very related to the

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.800
concept of retargeting or

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.240
remarketing that we will study

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.280
in a later class.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.120
I will give you two examples again.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.440
You make a TV ad and you can

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.300
generate a lot of warning or

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.980
a lot of traffic on time.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.380
But we are only at the top

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.360
of the funnel.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.080
However, there are other platforms,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.260
mainly for example social

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.920
networks or Google too, where

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.580
we can accompany the customer

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.000
throughout the funnel.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.300
That is, we can make traffic-

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.120
raising campaigns and then we

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.760
can re-impact them to generate

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.700
leads and to turn them into

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.100
sales.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.140
We will see.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.680
But it's a big advantage because

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.120
on the same platform, with the

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.620
same tool, with the same

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.440
knowledge, etc.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.640
This allows us to maximize the

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.320
return because you have many more

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.800
impacts to convince your customer.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.060
You can capture it, you

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.660
can convert it, you can close sales,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.100
you can impact it again when you are

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.540
already a buyer to increase the

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.940
customer life time value, etc.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.060
And finally there is a criterion

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.680
that is more subjective but that

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.020
is very important and is the effort,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.940
the know how, the dedication,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.340
that you have to do to put

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.300
in place a campaign or

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.480
a tool or control a platform,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.360
etc.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.160
This is a very thing to take into account.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.520
For example, imagine that

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.900
we decide or that you think making

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.600
video ads, whether on YouTube

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.060
for example, can be attractive

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.720
to you and can have a good

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.020
return.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.360
But it turns out you don't have any videos.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.100
That requires a lot of effort and that

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.200
at the end of that effort you have

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.060
to impact it on the return of the

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.780
campaign.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.700
Or, for example, you want to put

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.420
in place a content marketing strategy

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.480
with good content, etc.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.980
It is very good and is definitely

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.460
a great option.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.340
But there are some channels

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.340
that require you much more

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.760
effort, more knowledge, dedicated

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.240
people who know about it

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.420
and there are others

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.660
that are easier to manage.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.940
Well, the 10 criteria together

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.900
are those that are actually

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.320
used to decide whether you use one

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.460
channel or another or on which

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.480
priorities.
