WEBVTT

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.390
As you already know, conversions,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.190
optimizing conversions depends

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.810
on many things, but what is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.510
clear is that all use a common

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.090
medium and it is the website

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.530
or landing page.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.230
Therefore, one of the keys to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.990
optimizing conversion is to

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.010
optimize conversions within the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.190
website itself and that's what

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.210
we'll learn today.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.450
We will follow a simple method

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.850
that basically consists of

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.770
four steps.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.830
One, as always, identify

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.890
what the goal or goals

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.490
are, that is, what those

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.810
conversion ratios we have

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.810
to optimize.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.810
Two, let's do an analysis

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.070
of what's going on on the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.190
website to see what's not

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.650
working well, what's failing,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.130
or what's what we can

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.970
improve.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.990
Three, we'll implement improvements,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.490
some improvements, little by little,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.250
to see how those improvements

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.970
impact our goals.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.950
We start.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.270
Step one, as always, is to

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.490
be clear about the objectives.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.050
Here we return to a concept you

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.870
know that are macro conversions

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.930
and micro conversions and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.650
in each web or for each company

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.510
the macro conversions

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.810
and micro conversions will

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.550
be different, but here I will add

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.530
a concept, I will incorporate

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.850
the concept of call to action,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.250
the call to action that is

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.410
the call to action.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.390
Why is?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.490
It is very easy to find

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.110
out what conversions are.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.630
They are call to action.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.650
You do incorporate within your

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.190
web a few buttons, usually they

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.330
are buttons, although they do not

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.550
have to be, it could be a text,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.790
some links where you encourage

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.570
customers to click because

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.210
basically it is what there is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.050
infinity, because there are

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.970
all types.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.390
Subscribe to a newsletter,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.250
leave us your data, make a free

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.530
trial, buy, recommend to a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.750
friend, etc.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.110
There are thousands of calls

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.630
to action.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.030
Well, what we have to do is,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.070
we are in the first of the steps,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.370
it is to have clear what are those

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190
call to action, what are those

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.610
conversions we want, we have macro

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.810
and micro conversions, those

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.010
that are, usually are not

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.170
many on the web page and we

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.910
have to measure the conversion

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.510
ratios for each of those

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.750
conversions.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.770
The important thing here is to segment

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.370
well, as we always say.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.830
Why is?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.730
Because we have to measure

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.570
conversions for each of them,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.030
for different traffic sources

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.810
or for each of the customer

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.110
segments, etc.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.510
It is important to do so.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.830
Well, we already have clear that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.570
these are the goals, the ratios

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.350
we want to optimize, concrete

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.670
ratios and for each of the segments.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.970
And now what we have to do is

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.290
identify what is going on on

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.010
the website, what is what may

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.210
not be working well, because

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.510
only so will we know what is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.430
what we can improve.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.610
And you think the following.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.730
We have a conversion of 10% on two

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.530
levels, a micro conversion

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.850
of I and a macro conversion

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.670
in sales of 10%.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.930
This data is good, it is bad, it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.250
is that we have no idea, we do not

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.290
know and we do not know, only with

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.710
this data we do not know what is happening

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.710
on the website.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.630
We do not know if there is any of

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.450
the ones, within our website the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.930
main product page is very badly

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.370
made and is not understood.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.270
We don't know if customers have

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.370
a page they always go to or what

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.710
they don't understand.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.930
We have no idea.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.030
So, as you have no idea, you go

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.450
blind and then you can't improve

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.350
anything.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.210
The second step is to do a

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.850
very deep analysis of everything

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.550
that is happening on

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.750
your website.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.090
And this is a challenge.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.230
And how will we do it?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.890
We will do this by combining two perspectives.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.790
One, that's the usual thing

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.350
in Analytics and that's what everyone

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.870
does.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.590
One, measuring many things, many

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.270
data, many metrics.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.970
And we will do it with

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.610
tools like Google Analytics or Quizmetrics

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.150
or tools like that, that when

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.430
we get into the detail of how

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.250
analytics works, you will

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.610
understand what I am talking

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.170
about.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.470
This will allow us to have a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.410
view of our website from the perspective

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.130
of metrics, of very much information,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.210
of very much

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.090
data.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.650
Data such as, not only of the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.030
conversions, which are the basic, but,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.870
for example, the bounce rate, which

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.430
is the percentage of visits

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.150
that without having browsed the web

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.630
page, that enter, do not interest

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.370
them and go.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.670
Or the exit rate of each of the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.130
pages, which is, of each of the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.230
pages, what percentage of visits

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.450
are going there?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.030
This is valuable, because if, for example,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.770
it turns out that on one of your pages

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.750
you have a very high exit rate,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.630
because there is something going on

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.030
there.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.710
Or we can measure metrics

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.070
related to engagement, for

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.950
example.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.490
How much time do average

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.270
users spend on our website?

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.070


00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.050
The more it is, is it better, right?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.010
Because that's what your content is

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.890
interested in.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.510
How many media pages do you see?

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.070
This is also a metric that is very

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.490
related, because that, with engagement.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.750
You are creating attractive

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090
content, helping them

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.810
navigate, and so on.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.570
To what we were going.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.490
These are metrics and this is what we

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.910
will do with pure analytics, but

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.030
we have to have another perspective,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.050
because metrics explain us, give us

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.370
information about what is what

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.230
happens, right?

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.350
But we have to go to why it happens.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.430
We have to understand why the customer

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.590
results that on that particular

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.210
page where the exit rate is very

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.350
high, why he goes.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.710
What is?

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.650
Because it is boring, because it generates

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.530
anxiety the message, because it is

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.010
not understood.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.650
Well, it can be millions of things,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.950
but we have to go, we have

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.390
to always understand

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.970
why.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.210
We have to take the role of

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.890
customers.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.090
A lot of people do not do this.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.770
How can we do it?

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.270
There are different tools, but

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.690
they are relatively simple.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.370
For example, we can

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.110
use survey tools.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.410
For example, Qalaroo allows you

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.110
to incorporate within your website

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.070
in some of the pages, because to

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.450
incorporate a survey that jumps and

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.710
ask the customer, for example,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.670
does it seem that we have

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.170
explained the price plan well?

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.670
For example though.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.510
Or we can use tools that help

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.230
us, of different types,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.510
that help us to understand or

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.290
visualize how users are using

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.890
our website, which are tools

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.550
that are called user testing.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.990
I will give you an example.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.570
We can create a hit map that

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.270
we have on screen where we

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.070
see how our users are browsing,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.890
where they are browsing more.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.830
Imagine, for example, that your

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.690
main call to action or the most

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.310
powerful message you have, because

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.470
it is in an area that users

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.890
don't reach.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.990
We can see all this by

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.650
looking at a hit map.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.750
And another tip to get

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.790
insights, to understand why or

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.110
how customers are using

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.290
your website, is as simple

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.870
as asking them.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.830
Or it is so objective that they use

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.450
your website, see how they do it

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.930
and on the march ask them questions

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.810
about what doubts are arising to them, etc.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.210
Very few people do this.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.190
There are millions of experts in Google

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.350
Analytics who get crazy with data

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.970
and so on.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.950
And that is very well.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.570
This is a necessary perspective.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.590
But let's never forget the customer'

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.770
s perspective of talking to

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.910
people, because you get a valuable

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.130
feedback.
