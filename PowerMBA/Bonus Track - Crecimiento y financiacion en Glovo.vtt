WEBVTT

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.070
Oscar, tell us, I think it will

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.490
be very interesting, the story

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.190
of Globo, from the perspective of,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.010
well, from when you get the

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.530
idea, to how you grow, what

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.230
stages you are meeting, stages

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.550
in terms of the company growth,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.370
expansion, financing, how you

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.310
have been funding that growth.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.870
Well, Globo begins in early

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.710
2015, already reaching three,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.870
two and a half years.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.730
I was doing a practice in a very

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.990
large company, aeronautics,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.670
which bored me a little, I

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.010
started to turn around some

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.770
kind of idea, marketplace related

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250
to Uber, which was what was

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.910
most fashionable at the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.390
time and was growing more.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.990
So I came up with this idea

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.950
of creating a platform

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.090
that basically was a platform

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.070
that saved you time.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.310
In a big city, then a platform

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.550
where you could ask for any type

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.450
of message and there would be

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.910
a person who, in exchange for

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.650
an FII, could do this daily

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.570
task.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.910
That is, the first service, because

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.750
your service offer is very

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.110
wide and also combines different

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.790
models.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550
It was just this button that now says

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.530
what it is or anything, I don't know what

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.090
it says now.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.490
You were not connected to the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.010
company.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.770
There was not.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.230
You were not a marketplace yet,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.890
you really provided messaging service.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.790
The first Globe was a button that

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.090
said ask what you want and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.230
people wrote it like it was a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.950
text message.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.790
And this we sent to an independent

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.570
messenger platform and these made

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.190
the purchase or delivery

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.750
that the user requested.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.710
So with this Globe we

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.250
call 1.0 we were like

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.890
a year.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.090
That was the least viable product, it

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.450
could be.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.410
and yes.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.270
Obviously we had to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.250
fund it, we had to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.010
develop an app.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.950
We made a first round with this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.550
idea, because I pre-apply.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.750
He made a very simple presentation.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.810
What was the vision?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.890
Without much detail, because it is also

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.950
a phase where if you go to the investor

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.110
with a lot of detail of business

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290
plans you say hearing, you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.350
have no idea what will happen.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.830
So you don't need to give me any details.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.110
But well, the vision was very big,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.670
the opportunity too, and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.230
we managed to capture 100,000€.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.070
With the bis, with the product, with

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.810
the presentation.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.350
From Business Angels, the reality is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.250
that it all started because I met

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.410
a Business Angel via LinkedIn,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.250
that I got a meeting with him,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.410
I could present him the idea.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.150
He wanted to invest 10,000€, but he started

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.970
to introduce me to more people from

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.890
the ecosystem and eventually they were

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.850
100,000€ to kick off.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.610
Let's start with this application.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.130
We were a year with this first version

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.070
of the app.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.870
And the truth is we didn't have

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.150
money to invest in marketing, which

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.470
was all organic.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.010
We were trying to do a little about

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.290
social media.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.550
That's what you do in product development.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.050


00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.450
And the truth is that we came

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.790
out quite a bit in the press because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.750
the product was quite new.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.490
That you can ask for anything in a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.550
text message and that it comes to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.150
you immediately, was pretty chilling.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.510
The problem is that we didn't grow up.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.450
And we were a first year, which

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.230
well, that was one of the moments where

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.250
we almost palm.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.610
Because we didn't grow up.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.790
It was very difficult to start

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370
investors because the graphics were

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.770
not good.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.210
Did you get to capture users?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.370
It cost us a lot.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.390
Did you have no money, too?

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.110
It cost us a lot to convert.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.470
People were going to get rid of it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.670
because the concept was so crazy.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.610
But the discharge on request was terrible.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.330
Well, at the end we decided, heh,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.410
we're going to present a new

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.450
project to investors.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.050
And what we said was, heh, we're

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.630
going to pick up all this we've created

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.710
from what you want and we're going

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.850
to add a marketplace to it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.350
I will cut you off, Oscar, forgive me.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.810
Of course, that fact, you said, the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.610
conversion was terrible.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.030
That would be very hopeless at that time.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.990
Because of course, if you can

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.350
capture because the message

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.750
is powerful, but then people don't

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.290
use it, you'll face a huge problem.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.150
And you had identified why they didn't

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.730
use it.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.310
Of course, because if you don't

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.830
get it fixed, we't be here today.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.210
No, no no.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.590
We identified two things.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.070
One was that since we didn't

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.510
have a shop or restaurant

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.270
income, our only source of

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.810
income was the user.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.270
We had to pay him a lot.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.270
What the user pays for sending, yes.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.450
We had to pay 6 euros

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.750
per order.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.330
The other thing is that it raises a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.890
lot of doubts.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.790
This stands as you like, at the end

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.010
I always compare it as if you go

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.910
to a restaurant and the waitress

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.930
says, “Hey, what do you want

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.350
to eat?”

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.970
We will also talk about this, about the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.110
positioning, about how you position

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.730
yourself in the mind of...

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.870
of course.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.870
It is difficult to position.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.350
If you ask ten people today, ten

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.450
different people what Glovo is,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.630
I ask ten people in my environment

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.470
what Glovo is, I have been

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.570
recommended Glovo for

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.350
different reasons.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.310
Of course, and this is bad.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.190
That's bad, it's harder to position.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.770
and exact.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.110
In the mind of the consumer.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.910
Now imagine, even because you enter

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.550
and we try to guide you a little

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.610
bit the users, but it is easier

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.430
because the message is, we

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.910
bring you what you want.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.730
But it is that I have been

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.870
recommended Glovo, I have been

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.030
recommended people who see a lot

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.930
of value in that it is a food delivery

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.450
service.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.450
Some people recommend it because they

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.550
use it for the recipes.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.690
I have been recommended for

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.450
different reasons.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.790
and yes.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.630
And I love Glovo, I am a fan of Glovo,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.730
but I understand that it is a problem

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.990
because when your positioning, when

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.370
your messages, when you don't

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.470
have a clear way to position yourself

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.750
in the mind of the consumer, once

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.070
he already uses it, the consumer

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.470
then also explores and ends

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.270
up using the rest, right?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.870
Yes, yes yes yes

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.190
But I think that complicates

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.910
the marketing strategy.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.350
Yes something.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.290
At least we know that a lot

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.450
of users are following the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.730
same path now, if you want

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.310
later I tell you.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.770
Well, I wanted to explain a little

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.070
how this change from this Glovo 1.0

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.290
was and what we presented to

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.990
the investor that was, hear, we

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.670
will add, in addition to this asks what

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.070
you want, we will add a marketplace.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.170
This will solve both things.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.830
One, as the user will start to

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.470
see content, will understand

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.070
what he asks, prices, photos,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.190
stores.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.990
And on the other hand, as this store

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.490
will give us a commission, we will be

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.050
able to charge much less to the user.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.750
That is, you've fully pivoted into

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.350
the business model.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.650
and yes.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.810
Or you have added a new deal.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.610
and exact.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.930
Did you think of it one day?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.510
Little by little.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.930
When we talk a lot with users they told us this,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.110
sometimes I don't know what to ask, sometimes

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.930
they generate me a lot of doubts, it's

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.950
that it's very expensive, I don't know what.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.390
That was insights from what I

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.670
told you.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.910
Exactly yes, yes yes.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.590
Total of.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.550
Well, we don't pivot, but we add

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.050
this marketplace, what we call Glovo

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.990
2.0.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.470
And since then it has been unstoppable

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.190
growth very beast.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.090
In every city we launch

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.430
the model continues to work.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.450
And well, it has changed everything,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.650
not only on the part of growth,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.330
but also on the part of

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.830
business model.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.990
We used to lose a lot of money

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.030
on demand, now not.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.850
Now we are already beginning to

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.970
see the first cities and countries

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.150
that are entering profitability at

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.210
EBITDA level.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.470
And well, things are going well.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.770
What you said about positioning...

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.410
Sorry, we are going through the stages.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.950
The phases.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.970
The Pivots?

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.070
Suddenly, how many pips do you do?

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.250
year and a half.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.090
A year and a half ago.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.630
and yes.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.270
Very recently.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.310
And suddenly the results start

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.910
to see that, boom, things

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.790
are shooting, right?

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.210
and yes.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.310
So that's when we got...

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.490
Just with the change, we got the

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.270
first more or less decent investment

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.210
of our A-Series.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.690
and yes.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.190
It was 1.5 million.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.490
and yes.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.790
And so we could start investing

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.450
in marketing and we started using

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.130
the first online, offline

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.450
channels.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.870
We did something on the street, something on the television.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.990
And I would say we weren't the

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.290
best at measuring it.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.730
We also had no senior team.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:14.750
Now is yes.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.110
That is, now since the last round

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.490
entered, that a much more professional

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.350
investor than Rakuten entered, we already

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.590
have the equipment to measure

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.410
everything to the penny from

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.830
where users come, what they

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.450
convert, which channel is

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.730
more optimal and so on.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.710
Have you finished more rounds or

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.090
not?

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.910
We have a series of a...

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.610
We closed what was called the

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.170
1.5 million Seat Round.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.530
Then we closed the $5 million, which

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.570
already entered the first professional

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.790
investor, that Seaya, a Madrid

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.250
fund.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.070
And now three months ago we closed

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.050
the first international

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.410
fund that was with Rakuten

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.030
and then with a French

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.470
fund called Katay.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.830
It was a round of 30 million euros.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.390
And this round already, then, we went

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.630
with the pitch today, we have this in

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.770
Spain, which is very good.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.790
In Italy, it seems to be the

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.010
same.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.170
France and Italy are on the same path.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.290
We now need more funding

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.170
to expand internationally.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.950
And that's what we're doing now,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.030
opening up South America and

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.670
we're seeing more sites in the world.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.510
Well, really in your case, from

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.650
that perspective of the growth

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.790
stages is a book case.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.910
It is a case where you validate

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.550
the idea, go out with a MVP, start

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.550
working, then validate the

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.950
capture channels and at

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.030
a time what you have to

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.770
do is...

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.310
You validated that the model makes sense

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.030
and what you have to do is accelerate,

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.590
step the accelerator, grow around

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.290
the world and the more money you have

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.230
to do...

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.110
When you get to that point, the

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.030
more money the better.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.670
Yes, that is, when...

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.570
It is very difficult what we

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.510
are now mounting, which is the

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.050
Department of Expansion.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.710
In the end, the best Expansion Department

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.710
is one that can create processes

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.550
to open x hundreds or x thousands

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.270
of cities without each new

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.170
expansion affecting the core

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.630
business.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.310
That is, it is almost...

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.510
Building teams that are like launchers,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.090
that you are sending to these

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.630
cities to train the local teams,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.530
to launch the city and that all

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.410
this happens without Spain falling,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.530
without France and Italy falling

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.730
and is very complex.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.270
Of course, you need gasoline, which

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.730
is, therefore, a round of financing.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.210
But well, it has a very fun

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.410
trick in expanding quickly.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.770
Do you know?

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.070
We at the Globe the idea is that we move

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.830
from bringing three countries to bringing

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.350
15 in 12 months, with which everything

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.990
changes.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.750
In terms of the management of the

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.770
country, who is reporting to...

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.810
You have to turn around everything.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.190
Yes, it's a much bigger, more

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.670
complex and harder to manage

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.210
company.
