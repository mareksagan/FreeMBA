WEBVTT

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.600
And to finish what I am going to do

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.180
is to reinforce the benefits of this

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.340
methodology that in many cases I

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.940
have already named, but I want

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.320
you to understand them well.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.340
The first is the alignment

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.900
of the organization's strategic

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420
goals with what everyone

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.600
does.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.140
We will get people to work in the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.020
right direction, because many times

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.700
it is not to work harder, it is this

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.300
that they say work smarter not

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.040
harder, it is not a matter of

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.280
working more, it is that it is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.020
a matter of working better, of doing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.300
things that bring value.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.540
That is why we always say that being

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.600
able to prioritize permanently,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.580
being able to focus on what is important

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.880
at the level of the organization

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.960
and at the level of the person

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.180
is what marks the difference between

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.260
an organization that goes like that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.120
or one that goes more flat, because

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.020
the resources every day and every

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.580
day make the effort to prioritize

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.520
your time, your resources,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.100
all that power you are orienting

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.000
to something that brings value.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.920
The second of the advantages

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920
is the great transparency

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.720
that OKR has.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.080
Let us think of the usual systems,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.060
for example, performance

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.280
management.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.560
They are completely opaque.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.760
Your bosses or managers do what

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.540
they do is set goals for

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.680
you, but to start with, when they

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.980
set goals for you, they have

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.180
no visibility for anything

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.680
else.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.600
They sit with you and set you quarterly,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640
semi-annual, annual

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.100
goals, but no one knows anything

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.860
else.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.700
Instead, this, OKR, is meant

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.000
to be super transparent, so

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.240
that everyone knows what

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.620
the CEO's goals are, the goals

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.280
of his colleagues, the goals

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.720
of the department.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740
And this helps in many ways.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.480
For example, it helps employees

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.600
to be much more motivated

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.720
because they know how they contribute

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.240
to their work, their task, their

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.100
effort, and how they contribute

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.080
to the company's strategic goals.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.040
Why am I here?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.560
OKR helps a lot to understand

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.280
this.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.240
Another advantage is that for

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.360
managers, for example, it is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.620
much easier to set the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.940
goals of the teams, it is easier

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.920
to manage the team, because you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.080
have visibility of what are

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.360
the strategic goals of the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.820
company, other departments, etc.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880
And, above all, because OKR, as

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.620
you have seen, is a super simple system.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.180
We identify goals, identify

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.040
between 3 and 5 key results

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.240
and point.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.460
Look how simple.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.800
We will do it with each

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.220
member of the team.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.020
It helps a lot, it is very simple and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.360
very simple.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440
And this is a great advantage.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600
Another advantage is that it allows us

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.160
to the whole organization, thanks to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.360
this simplicity and this transparency,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
to make a permanent follow-

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
up of whether we are on the right

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.580
track or not.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.040
It's much easier to identify if

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.200
we're not on the right track with

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.820
an OKR system than if we don't

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.680
have any.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.220
Because if we don't have any, what

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.720
we have is disorganized information,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.480
a lot of people, etc., and in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000
the end you don't know what's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.940
going on.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.960
With OKR you get quick

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.900
visibility of whether projects

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.060
are going well, if we

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.300
will strategic goals,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.340
if we need to change

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.320
something, etc.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.620
Another advantage, and it is

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.860
very related to the first, is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.820
that the entire organization,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.980
everyone, each of the people,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.880
focus on goals, focus on benefits,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.400
focus on value, not focus

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.060
on tasks.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.660
We will stop measuring

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.900
productivity and based on what

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.540
you do.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.620
If you do things that contribute

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.960
to the company's strategic goals,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.560
well.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.900
If not, what you are doing is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.600
not worth it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.400
That probably many of the things

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.040
we all do in What Happens

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.080
is that, well, we're not aware.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.720
If we constantly consider what

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.740
our OKRs are, what the goal is

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.560
and what the key results are,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.580
we will devote more time to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.760
reaching those key results

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.380
and not doing things that

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.380
have no value.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.000
And lastly, the last of the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.220
benefits or benefits is collaboration.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.440
Better communication between teams

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.660
is generated because, related

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.300
to what was said about transparency,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.500
all the work, the others and,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.060
in many cases, the OKRs, as they

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.400
are shared by teams, you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.760
are aligning people so that

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.280
they contribute to the same

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.560
goals and fostering collaboration.
