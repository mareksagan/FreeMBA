00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
The sports generic strategies are an excellent tool and that is why we have put so much focus on it,

00:12.400 --> 00:20.000
because it helps us to understand how the different competitive advantage sources or strategies that a company has are.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
However, if we take it in a very strict way, there may be companies that we do not know where to frame them.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Let's see why.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Let's review what is the cost management strategy.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
If you opt for cost management, what you have to do is reduce costs throughout your value chain.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
And your clients will choose you by price. Here we have the example of Ryanair.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Ryanair's clients choose Ryanair by price.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And also, your clients will be very unfaithful.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
It is almost impossible that with a pure strategy of cost management you have faithful clients.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
If we go to the differentiation strategy, it is the opposite.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Your clients, as in the case of OEB, choose you because there is something about your proposal that they like.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
And you usually get some fidelity or loyalty with the clients.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
But now I'm going to put the case of several companies, such as IKEA, for example, or Zara, or Mercadona, or Toyota.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
And we will reason if they fit more within the strategy of cost management or differentiation.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Because it is complex. Mercadona, for example, is a company that is clearly a leader in cost management,

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
but nevertheless there are hundreds of thousands of clients that are absolutely loyal to Mercadona.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
They do not choose Mercadona for cost alone.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Therefore, it is already complicating us. We do not know where to place it.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And the same would be said with IKEA, with Zara, with Toyota.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
For this reason, a new strategy has been born called Best Cost Strategy, which is the strategy of the best cost.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
And we are going to analyze it with the case of IKEA.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
IKEA is the clear leader in cost of its industry.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It was just like it grew.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
It won a huge market share thanks to having costs much lower than the rest of its competitors,

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
to its huge scale economy, and being able to impact those costs savings in the prices of the final product.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
And there are many proofs. It is very efficient in terms of all logistics, warehouses, etc.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
And another example of its commitment to cost management is the fact that you have to assemble the furniture.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
That they are not assembled.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
It has reduced the level of service with the aim of reducing costs.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
However, I believe that IKEA, from that huge scale economy and making certain innovations in its value proposition,

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
has managed to incorporate certain factors or certain particularities that fit more into a differentiation strategy.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
If we think about it, if we follow the criterion of whether customers choose IKEA only for cheap,

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
or there are customers who also choose it for some differential factor that they like about IKEA,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I think the answer is yes.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
There are many customers of IKEA who do not buy IKEA only for cheap, but because it provides them with things they like.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And I'm going to give you an example.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
The return policy of IKEA does not correspond to a low-cost company.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Because it does not contribute to saving.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Having a policy like that, that you can return the product, is extreme.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
In 365 days, even if you have used it, you can change it for another.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
If your policy is strictly low-cost, you do not allow yourself to do these things.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Because it obviously does not contribute.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
On the contrary, if your main goal is to reduce costs, you would have deduction policies that would have to be legal.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Or be strictly within the legal limit.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
For example, IKEA catalogs provide value to IKEA customers.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Because they can, in their homes, take ideas, etc.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Choose the furniture they are going to buy before going to the point of sale.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
This is clear that it does not correspond to a low-cost policy.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Because IKEA spends a lot of money distributing millions of catalogs around the world.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
In addition, IKEA contributes to other differential values.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
For example, design.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I think this is the result of the huge scale economy.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
Because despite being the leader in cost, with that size you have, you can hire designers, etc.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
You can invest in the design of the product.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
But investing in design does not correspond to a low-cost strategy.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
A company that competes strictly in low-cost would have to invest as little as possible.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
Another factor that contributes to people buying IKEA, not only for the price, is the huge range or variety of range.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
This means a lot of comfort for customers.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
A customer can furnish an entire apartment in IKEA.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Not only furnish it, but buy everything he needs for a home.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
This is clear that it is an additional value that IKEA is able to contribute.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And that makes its customers not buy it just for the price and are also loyal.

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
Therefore, IKEA responds, as well as Toyota, Mercadona or Zara, which we will analyze in detail.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
They respond to a generic strategy that does not correspond to the leader in cost, differentiation or niche.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
But it could be considered Best Cost Strategy.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
They have relatively low prices and costs compared to the rest of the industry.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
However, they are able to provide differential values that make their customers loyal.
