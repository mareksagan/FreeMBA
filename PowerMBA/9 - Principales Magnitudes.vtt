00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.550
The most valuable thing for an MBA student

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.650
is not that he knows how to

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.610
account, it is not that he knows the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.390
accounting standards, the most

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.710
valuable thing is that he knows

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.930
how to analyze companies from

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.490
the information that accounting offers us.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.730
In this class, what we will

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.810
see is briefly, because there

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.310
will be later classes in which

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.110
we will do deeper analysis,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.690
we will see the magnitude of

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.050
profit we obtain from the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.890
results, gross margin, EBITDA,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770
EBIT, EBT which is gross

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.490
profit and finally net

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.550
profit or performance result.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.810
Let us see what the differences

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.590
are and what they tell us.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.620
Let's go with the first one, which is the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.500
gross margin.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560
The gross margin is obtained,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.160
if you remember, from sales less

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.780
the cost of sales, less the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.160
direct cost of sales.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.760
So what is the gross margin that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.920
informs us?

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.880
I like to explain it this way, it tells

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.260
us about the profitability of the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.220
product or service itself.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.480
Please note that we have not yet taken

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.900
into account fixed expenses, nor

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.360
corporate expenses, nor debt

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.040
or anything.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.100
We have simply deducted the costs

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.780
directly associated with the product

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.160
or the provision of the service.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.800
This is the best size to identify

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.120
whether we have products or services

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.720
that are profitable or not.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.160
Look, I want you to keep in mind

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.620
that gross margin is sometimes

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.040
represented as a ratio.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.000
In this case, we are taking

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.920
into account the rest, more

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.780
income less direct costs.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.940
In fact, the gross margin translation

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.660
in English is the quota.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.620
The term “brutto margin”

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.580
is translated as

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.240
gross profit.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.790
In short, I want to explain

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.130
what are the costs we will subtract

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.690
to calculate the gross margin.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.550
There are different criteria, but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.770
the most accepted criterion

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.170
is that we have to rest or sell

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.390
the product or service.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.690
As we see here in the chart,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.450
as we sell more, the cost grows.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.430
Instead, there are other costs

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.610
that are fixed costs, which

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.450
we will put down later, which

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.630
are structural costs, which are

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.890
more flat.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.110
Yes, they will grow, if the company

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.590
grows a lot, opens delegations

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.730
in other sites, etc., because

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.830
for example office rentals

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190
will grow and this will jump.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.470
In principle, it is a straight line.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.390
The variable cost increases

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.030
the variable cost.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.220
The gross margin depends very

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.880
much on the industry or

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.100
activity we are in.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.480
And usually all competitors

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.440
within the same sector have

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.000
more or less similar gross

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.820
margins.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.780
There are activities, for example,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.920
think in a supermarket as we

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.800
have on screen.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.300
Well, because usually in the distribution

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.120
the gross margin is not excessively

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.060
high.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.270
And compare it to a business like

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.310
a game, an online game, a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.070
game or an app like Angry Birds.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.630
What is the...

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.890
Think of this curve?

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.150
What is the variable cost for

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.570
each of the games you sell?

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.770
Well, it is that it tends to zero,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.550
so the gross margin is very high.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.560
Now, let's go with the rest of the sizes.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.000
We have a screen of evita, evita and evt.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.280
As you can see, we use acronyms

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.300
and are Anglo-Saxon terms,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.720
but it is what is used usually.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.720
This is based on the earnings before concept.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.500
It means profit before.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.000
Avoid is the profit before the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.560
amortisation of interest

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.180
and debt.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.160
Avoid is profit before

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.620
interest and debt.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.160
EUT, which is the gross profit,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.180
is earnings before taxes.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.560
The benefits before taxes.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.200
It will help you understand what

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.140
each of the concepts means by

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.940
knowing what the acronym comes

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.540
from, right?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.100
Let's start with the avoidance.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.320
We avoid starting from the gross margin

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.440
and what we do is to cut off the fixed

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.820
expenses.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.320
The evita is a super-used magnitude

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.720
by analysts and we will see

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.980
in later classes exactly

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.680
what the reason for this is.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.400
If we also take off the amortization,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.380
we have the evit.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.860
In this case, avoid and avoid.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.820
What I want you to be clear is that

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.120
both cases inform us of the operational

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.720
profit, the profit of the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.420
business.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.760
You probably thought that the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.340
operative benefit is not the net

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.980
profit, it is the avoid or the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.540
avoid.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.260
And why?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680
Avoidance and avoidance

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.740
are before interest and taxes.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.600
Neither interest nor taxes

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.300
have anything to do with the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.160
company's operations.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.260
Interest has to do with how you have

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.760
funded yourself, whether you have

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.420
asked for more or less debt and what the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.360
cost of that debt is.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.120
And taxes have to do with the tax

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.840
regulations or the tax rate

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.940
of the country you are operating

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.620
in.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.920
Look, I will give you an example.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.520
We have two companies, company A

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.420
and company B.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.980
In both cases, they have obtained

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.780
a similar operating profit

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.580
of $100,000.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.360
But one has no debts, so it does

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.440
not pay interest.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.120
The other one, yes, pays $20,000 of interest.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.500
And a tax in a country

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.440
with a 10% tax rate on profits.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480
So you pay $10,000.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.260
The other one, 25%, pays 40,000.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.890
This is true because the outcome

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.350
of the exercise is very different in

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.690
both cases.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.950
Company A has a business result

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.450
of $90,000 and Company B has

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.510
a business result of $60,000.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.110
Probably if we only analyze the outcome

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.250
of the exercise, we would consider

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.010
that the operations or

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.930
business of company A is working

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.370
better than that of company

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.910
B.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.350
However, it is not so.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.890
What is working best is simply,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.950
the business is working

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.630
the same way.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.810
What happens is that you pay less

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.830
taxes and you have been funded

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.630
or borrowed less.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.870
And finally we have the result of

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.910
the exercise, the net profit, which

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.170
is a concept that you sure understand

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.350
in which we do not need

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.290
to enter now.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.610
What I want you to know is what

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.570
the differences between

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.870
the different magnitudes

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.990
we have seen are.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.430
We have seen the gross margin,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.790
we have seen the profits,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.090
the operating profit-related

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.250
magnitudes that are EBITDA

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.250
and EBIT and the performance

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.870
result.
