00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Lidia, you are the Chief Happiness Officer of Habitísimo, a company with more than 2.5 million employees,

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
with a considerable size, and what I want you to explain to us is this, because your position is what is sometimes called what?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Director of Human Resources?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Director of Human Resources, exactly.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
The idea of the name arises from the idea that we had of renewing the department a little,

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
so that the Human Resources Department becomes a cost center, a benefit center for the company.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, because indeed, on many occasions it is perceived only as a cost center, as a lesser evil,

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
or a cost that you have to assume, but in some cases it is not perceived as having enough value, and that should not be the case.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Normally, the directors of Human Resources are the necessary evils in the company.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
That, necessary evils, I did not get the term.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Because it is at the end of the day the one who has to manage the contracts, select, carry out the training, if there is any.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
And what we have tried in Habitísimo is to take a turn to that paradigm.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
We knew and we were sure that the first thing we had to do was change the name,

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
because if you have it in the name it is part of your responsibility, and the happiness of the employees is mine in this case.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
And also because we wanted to turn it around.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
As you say, the Human Resources team has always been seen as that necessary evil,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
the one who has to fix what is broken, or the one who calls the employee when something does not work.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
In our case, what we do is work on potentiality.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
We try not to wait for something to go wrong to fix it, but proactively make things go better,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
and that the employees have to focus on what they really have to focus on, which is doing the job.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm going to be the devil's lawyer in this talk.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
It sounds very good, what you have said, we are going to focus on potentiality,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
but I would like you to help us visualize it with specific examples.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
To work in the happiness, which is what we call it in Habitísimo,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I usually touch on four key points.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
First, it is the leadership style.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
And that goes through working, how the boss or leader communicates with their employees,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
and also managing their ego.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
And that is perhaps the most delicate or hardest part.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Because when you are a boss, you have to drive a team,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
and also feel that their decisions are good,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
and you have to be able to listen to what is not doing well in order to improve it.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So you work with the different bosses of the internal departments.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
How do you work with them?

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
We have a leadership program, to work in what is called charismatic leadership,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
or being someone influential in your team,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
and that generates that movement and makes them better.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And that goes through doing technical training,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
like the Power MBA that some of us are doing,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
as well as training in terms of...

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I didn't know you were a Power MBA student.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Three of the directors are, and we are expanding.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
We have technical training, both in our own position,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
such as human resources, finance, marketing, etc.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
We have training in company management.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
For example, the director of Brand can also do training in finance,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
training in people management, to complete or improve our capabilities.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And then we have training that has more to do with our leadership style,

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
work on our profile, and know the profile of the people you have in your team,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
to improve communication.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
That is one of the phases that we have and that is important.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's the first one, right?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It's the first one.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Which is working on the leadership style, you said.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
The leadership style and communication.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
How do we work on communication?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Precisely, which is the second leg...

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Sorry to interrupt you, let's do one thing.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You told me there are four, what we are going to do is...

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
I'm going to ask you to tell me how you are changing the culture of your organization.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm going to ask you to tell us what is the benefit of each one of them,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
that is, what benefit are you perceiving,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
what impact on the organization, on the results, I don't know,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
of each of the initiatives that you have launched.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The first one is the leadership one.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I start the leadership part again?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
You have already told us how, but what I want you to tell me is what benefits,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
what have you perceived that has changed thanks to that.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Working on leadership, what we improve, first is the agility of the team.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It is a team that communicates better, that communicates more agilely,

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
that the workers report more immediately all the problems that may be,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
and that are also more prone to give ideas.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
I like this a lot because we have seen in many organizations that communication does not flow

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
and in the end, and it happens a lot, in the people who are, what we call in the last mile,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
which is the one who is in contact with the client, people who are in a concentration center, etc.,

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
who receive very valuable information, not only complaints, suggestions, etc.,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
they have millions of ideas, but they never arrive,

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
they never arrive because then the organizations are long, I don't know if you use that term,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
but there is the head of the department, then there is the CEO, etc.,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
and in the end what happens is that you are destroying the most important flow of information

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
that for me is from the client to the CEO, to the one who makes the decision.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
To solve that part, what we have are many feedback channels.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
We have an intranet, we have anonymous buttons, we have Open Mic sessions

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
where Jordi and the CEO meet with all the employees they want and for an hour

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
they ask all the questions or give the feedback they want,

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
we have ideas sections, we have an application where you vote how happy you have been in the day

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
and you can leave an anonymous comment.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So there are specific tools to solve this.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Yes, and you also have to facilitate as many channels and tools as possible,

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
better, anonymous, personal, online, so that everyone has the option to choose which one they like the most.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
And the second very important part to give feedback and that people continue to give it to you

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
is to give immediate answers to the employees, always, in any case,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
and work, as I said before, on the part of the ego of the leaders.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Ok, so we have touched on the first part of the four that you have told me,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
which is to change the style of leadership, which we do through a very diverse training,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
that you work a lot with the bosses of each team and then this issue has arisen,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
which is to improve the flow of communication from top to bottom, from bottom to top, etc., with specific tools.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Ok, the second of the four is to work on corporate culture.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
You have a series of labor rules, which are the status of the workers,

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
the agreement that governs you or the written rules that you have as a company and that your labor contract marks you,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
but in addition to those you have to have some behavior rules and they must be closely linked to the values

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
and corporate culture that you want to be reflected in your company.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
So, to work on that part, first you have to know what the values are,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
you have to have them identified with behaviors,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
and all the actions that are carried out from the company must meet those values.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Ok, what are the values?

07:29.000 --> 07:39.000
You have told me that there are a series of values that you have to ensure are present in all the actions, which are?

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Working as a team, openness to change, knowing and being aware that your actions have an impact,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
talking about things and on that part the feedback is also linked.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
We are very clear that feedback is part of one of the values and that is why corporate culture is present.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Knowing that on the Internet things change constantly and that you have to be open to that change,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
receiving those changes with a positive attitude, taking into account that it is a team.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
When two people started, when there were eight, when there were thirty, that was when I arrived,

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
and we are still 250 now, and that is a fundamental part for the information to flow.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
I have doubts, we have said, the second of the initiatives is to ensure a certain culture that is based on a series of values.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
I have doubts about practice, that is, how to get it really, because the subject of corporate culture seems exciting to me,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
but sometimes it is difficult to take it to a method, how to achieve it.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
It has to be present in all actions, so when you do a selection process,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
which would be the first part in which you have contact with a person,

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
you have to do that selection process based on values, and in addition to selecting by competencies,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
do it according to values, and if that person does not meet them, he cannot be part of the company.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
That seems to me, indeed, it is very easy to understand, it is common sense, but it works.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
That is, if you want, and it is perceived especially in smaller companies,

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
but it is also true that we can identify certain cultural values in larger companies,

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
and I am referring to the fact that the profile of people has certain homogeneities,

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
and it is because the people who have selected them have sought that.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Yes, that is why I was saying that it is important to have values associated with behavior.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
We work in a team, for example, and all the offices are open space,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
because constant interaction is important.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
So a person whose biggest dream is to work in a single office,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
the organization no longer has to exist, and this may be a bit extreme,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
but in an interview you can see if a person is collaborative,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
if he has had problems or not in different teams,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
if he is a person who faces changes in his life in a positive and energetic way.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
These things can be detected, and that is a first step.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Obviously, in a selection process, there are things that can happen to you,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and that is why, when they are already inside the company,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
in the evaluation and feedback processes that we do to measure the individual performance of each of us,

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
a part of the evaluation of the values is also included.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
In addition to all this, we try to recognize the people who show the company's values in an extraordinary way,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
and we have them constantly present in all the activities we do.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
How do you do that?

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Every year we do a survey of values and culture,

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
and we decide to work during that year on one of the values, the one we want to improve.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
A review is made, we see if it makes sense to keep them all the same,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
if we have to make some changes, but the whole company participates in that.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
It is a job that has to be daily, it is not worth having a picture with the written values,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
that is very nice, and we also have it, but there has to be a daily job,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
and a person who is responsible for that.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
You are.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Exactly, that's where the name goes.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
We have said leadership, we have said culture, and there are two more.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Support networks, which is to work, that the colleagues are that, colleagues.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
You have to make spaces easier for them to be together.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
You have to facilitate activities in which they can interact.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
And people have to understand that when they come to work at Habitísimo,

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
they are not only going to work at Habitísimo in the department of, for example, Comercial España,

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
but they are going to work in a community in which we all have to be supporting.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
That is why we have, as I told you, the Open Space,

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
we have many monthly trainings that are done interdisciplinarily,

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
no training is done for an exclusive team, we always try to mix people.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
We have play activities, which are the parties, which are very necessary,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
although many people think they don't help.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
We have all the common spaces, the rest and leisure rooms are located

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
in a strategic place in the office so that everyone has to go there and meet.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
We spend a lot of time taking care of those spaces to make people feel comfortable.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
When we incorporate people, we do it in groups and also in groups of different teams

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
so that they also have that relationship.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
We prepare dynamics so that they get to know the people who are already there.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
We introduce them, we have quarterly meetings where we introduce the new ones,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
we put their photos, etc.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
The goal of this entire block, what would it be?

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
To have a company where the horizontal and vertical communication is better

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
because everyone feels part of the same team?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Everyone feels part of the same team and everyone is open to help the person next to them

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
because they know them.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Regardless of whether they are dedicated to something totally different.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Because that in large organizations, it seems that it is like they become true silos,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
it is like, well, I'm going to pass this on to the legal ones,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and the legal ones perceive it as a few shots that are going to pull you back.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Or there are those in finance who tell me, no, the one in shopping, right?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
And you want to avoid that.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Of course, in fact, for example, for the technology team, it is super beneficial

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
to go and sit down every so often with the commercial team,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
because while they are making calls, they can see how they interact with, for example,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
our CRM that they have developed, and it helps them to make improvements for the commercial team.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Or I am very interested in knowing what the communication dynamics are like

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
between the commercial team and the customer attention team

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
to see if the position they have or the physical distribution of the office is optimal

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
so that they are in constant interaction, for example.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
You know what happens many times when organizations grow and become too departed?

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
The worst of all is not that they lose communication between them,

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
but that a huge distance is usually generated with the customer, which is the most important thing.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
So in the end, the technical team measures its productivity based on technical advances,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
but it does not measure it based on the value that the customer has generated.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And in the end, everyone forgets about the customer,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
and that has enormous repercussions in the value generation.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Many times we try to break our heads

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
by looking at the flow of perfect information from the customer to the commercial team,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
which will then pass to the customer attention, which will then pass to management,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
which will then pass to marketing, which will then pass to technology.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
And it is much easier if you make it depend on people.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
If you get the commercial team that is calling Brazil to be a friend,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
to have a good relationship with the developer who carries that part of the page,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
the information will be much more fluid.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
Notice how interesting, that sometimes it has more impact not in the development of formal processes,

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
but the one that is informal, but thanks to the fact that people are close.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
What happens is that when you acquire a certain dimension, that is impossible.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
You have to accompany someone.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You have 250 employees, but if you had 10,000,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
there are formal processes in which that information is shared, or it is impossible.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Yes, obviously, formal processes are super necessary,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and as you grow, they help you to give order,

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
streamline and ensure that it reaches the right person.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
But if you make a patent to people, that we are all together,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
and you help them to create good environments,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
if you have had a good time with a person,

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
it is much easier for you to communicate with them, that you are willing to collaborate.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Many people take this part as something very aesthetic,

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
the typical ping-pong that entrepreneurs have, or football.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It is not about having a ping-pong or a football,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
it is about having a point where people meet, have a good time,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
and from there, that relationship is worked.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
It is not the aesthetic part, the cool part, or the cool part,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
that many people want to give.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
In the end, people work with people and for people.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
I have been in offices where they have all the details of start-ups,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
the scooter, the ping-pong, the football, and you see them all sad.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
It does not work.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
They do not let them use it.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I do not know if they let them use it or not,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
but in the end, the reality is that they do not talk to each other,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
they are sad, and the aesthetic detail is not accompanied by anything else,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
by the truth, by the values, as you told us.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And that we have to set an example.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
We have a slogan, which is to say that no one is going to do more stupid than their boss.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
So, the bosses or department directors have to set an example,

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
and we are the first ones to be dressed up on Carnival day,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
which is something we have as a tradition in the office,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
or the day we have an RSC activity, being the first to do it.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Obviously, if it does not go from top to bottom, it does not permeate.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
A movie is coming to my mind, which is the logo of Wall Street.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
We should not say that, right?

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
It is a different culture, not the one I would promote in my company,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
but in the end it is a powerful culture, the one they have in the movie.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
We have said three points and we have the last one left.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
The one of caring for people.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
As an organization, you have to let your people know that you are caring for them.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
And this part does not have to be confused with giving everything they ask for.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
As an organization, you have to know what you want to give.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
In our case, we give a lot of weight to training.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
And whoever comes, and has the time to be with us,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
two months because he is going to do some practices,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
two years because he decides to leave, or 20, I hope we get there.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
That person has to have grown as much as the company has.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
In the end, when you work or start a startup,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
you give a lot of energy and you give a lot to the project.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
And in the end you give yourself a lot from the heart.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
It is a project in which you believe, you do not know if it will work or not,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
and you put a lot of soul in the project.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And it is the cool part of entrepreneurs or the one that hooks.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
So, as an organization, you have to be generous with what you have been given.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And just as you give back to society what you take,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
you also have to give it to the employees.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And what do you give them? Training?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
We give a lot of training.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Then we work a lot on the part of conciliation.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
And when I talk about conciliation, I do not mean only the part of family conciliation.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
You have to help people to conciliate with their studies, for example,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
or conciliate with their private life.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And it is very important.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
You cannot ask someone to develop professionally and get here

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
if the personal part is being stolen and you are taking away their energy.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
That part is fundamental.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
So, that conciliation in all its personal part,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
being available is 100% for them.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
My job, if I have time, I do other things,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
is to be available to people and to help them.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
If something happens to them at work or outside,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I help them to solve it.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
It is not real that Lidia, who is at home,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
removes that paper from the office door

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and the Chief Happiness Officer comes in,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
and then the Chief Happiness Officer stays in Habitísimo and I go to my house.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
That separation is not real.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And if you want a person to be in a competitive environment, giving 100%,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
he cannot be worrying or carrying a backpack full of stones.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I always give the same example.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
The environment is super competitive, I will not repeat it in the global part,

19:52.000 --> 19:59.000
but the world in which we move is similar to running 100 meters with Usain Bolt.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
You already know that the probabilities are scarce and that the other will run a lot.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
But if in addition to having to run 100 meters,

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
you are put a few pounds on your feet and you go 50 meters back,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
that is already impossible.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
So what we try to mitigate is that,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
to remove that weight, put them on the line,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
and that the person can develop the potential.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
I would add here, at least, to give them a lot of freedom,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
not to empower them.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Give them a lot of freedom, give them a lot of responsibility,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
because that makes people grow.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
And autonomy.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
And autonomy, yes.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
The main task for me as a department director, a boss, a team leader,

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
whatever you want to call it, is to recognize their own shortcomings,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I go back to being aware, self-knowledge, ego, and so on,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
and surround yourself with people who supply those shortcomings.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
If you surround yourself with people who supply those shortcomings and empower them a lot,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
the team is empowered, has a brutal level of engagement,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
which is the desirable, the opposite of stress,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
and it is what makes the work absorb you and you dedicate hours without effort

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
and you lose track of time.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
You have people who face challenges better,

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
because they have levels of self-knowledge and a brutal self-efficacy.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
So, when a problem comes, they know they will be able to solve it.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
If you haven't given them some colleagues with whom they can interact,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
they will be able to help them solve that problem,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and they will also contribute ideas,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
because they know that the knowledge they have is great.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Ok, so we have been very clear about the benefits that are obtained

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
at the organizational level, taking better care of people,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
and you proposed four initiatives that I will simply name,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
which were one, taking care of the leadership style,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
which you do by training, being very close to the team leaders,

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
taking care of corporate culture, always based on values,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
values that have to be embedded in absolutely every decision,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
every action, every day.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
We were talking about, I call them support networks,

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
but basically it is a name, a little, support networks,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
which sounds very technical, but deep down it is that a company is,

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
that everyone is very close, that they are good colleagues,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
that they know each other and that they are able to share information,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
and you gave us an interesting advice,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and it is that sometimes that is more effective

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
than the fact of establishing formal processes of information flows.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Sometimes it is better that, that they go on Thursdays to have drinks,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and that the company pays them and they become friends,

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
and that will have a greater impact than the fact of defining flows.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And finally, you were talking about taking care of people,

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
which is how, that is, taking care of people, I understand, giving them a lot,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
because if you ask them a lot, you have to give them a lot,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and in your case you talk about training, you talk about reconciliation,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
and you talk about always being close to the employees.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Okay, Lidia, thank you very much, congratulations on your project,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and I wish you many successes.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Thank you.
