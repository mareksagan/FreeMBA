00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.060
In accounting, there is always a balance

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.540
that we call the fundamental

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.500
equation, and it is that the asset

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.840
is equal to the liability plus

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.840
the net asset.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
It is very useful to understand it well

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.140
because it helps us to check whether

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.340
the accounting seats have been well

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.140
done or if we have made any

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.620
mistake.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.480
And this lesson will help you understand

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.860
the balance sheet in a greater

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.260
perspective.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.240
As we say, the asset is equal to the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.960
liability plus the net asset.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.020
The block of the left is

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.560
the same as the block of the right

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.040
or vice versa.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.840
But to understand it will help

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.560
you see it from this perspective.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.440
In fact, the two sides of the balance

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.460
sheet are the same.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.120
What happens is that we are seeing

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.540
it from a different perspective.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.480
Net assets and liabilities

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.760
tell us where the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.520
funds came from.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.880
The asset tells us where we have

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.020
allocated those funds.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.000
Look at it this way.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.260
We have created a company.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.240
We have contributed the social capital

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.320
of $100,000.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.400
That $100,000 is in the bank.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.980
Both sides of the balance sheet are

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.220
actually reporting the same thing.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.180
What are those $100,000?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.120
What happens is that we see it from

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.040
a different perspective.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.280
In the case of the right, what informs

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.580
us is where they come from.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.880
And what he is saying is that we have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.040
brought it to our partners.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.420
And in the case of the left of

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.460
the destinations, what it is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.600
telling you is that those $100,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.560
000 are in the banks.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.760
But it is really the same.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.250
It is therefore very obvious that

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.150
there must be a balance.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.350
Net assets are equal to net assets.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.090
And look, we'll see it differently.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.710
Let us see it like this.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.290
Net assets are equal to less passive

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.310
assets.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.830
It is also very common sense.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.390
What belongs to the partners, their

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.990
real net worth is equal to all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.890
the investments they have made

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.970
minus the debts they have contracted.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.250
This balance means that every

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.490
time we make an account

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.170
note, we have to make

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.870
another note on another

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.230
account to maintain

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.170
the balance.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.310
This is called the double entrance

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.890
system.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.930
If we only make a note, imagine

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.650
yourself in the bank account, because

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.570
we would be breaking that balance.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.210
If we increase banks but do not

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.070
increase any other part, the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.850
asset would be greater to the net

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.450
asset plus the liability.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.410
That is, every seat always

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.130
affects at least two accounts.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.330
Let us take a few examples to illustrate it.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.230
Let's look at a case.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.730
We create a company, start the business

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.110
and the partners contribute $100,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.790
000 to the social capital.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.230
What effect is produced?

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.650
Increase the passive by $100,000.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.010
But there is a need to move

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.610
forward so that the balance

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.270
can beined.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.590
In this case, what we do

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.790
is an account note for

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.070
the same amount, for $100,000.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.650
As we can see from the balance

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.290
sheet, the balance is still beingined.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.490
We have an asset with $100,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.590
000 and the liability

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.850
and net worth are

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.750
$100,000.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.150
Now we are making an investment

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.630
in a fixed asset worth $75,000.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.670
It decreases the asset account

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.430
by $75,000, so the asset

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.990
decreases by $75,000.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.350
And what we do is replace it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.550
with another asset account, in

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.310
this case the machine, worth

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.270
$75,000.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.590
If we look at the balance

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.690
sheet, we see that the balance

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.670
is still being met.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.630
In this case, banks have ceased

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.350
to have a $100,000 amount,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.170
but the machinery

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.130
grows to 75,000.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.510
Finally, we got a loan.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.530
We make a note on the long-

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.270
term debt for a value

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.190
of $25,000.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
The passive is increasing

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.750
by $25,000.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.210
And the asset too, because the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.330
balance of banks grows by 25,000.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.530
We will again check how this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.710
last movement allows us to continue

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.230
to fulfill the requirement of balance.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.090
The bank account has

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.210
increased by $25,000.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.870
And the long-term debt, which is

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.230
a passive account, has been created

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.670
in the have for $25,000.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.790
We therefore continue to fulfill

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.910
the liability and net asset, which

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.050
are equal to the asset.
