WEBVTT

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.460
Pilar is welcome.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.260
Adi Borja, thank you very much.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.020
A lot thanks.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.220
I think Power Marketers

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.780
will enjoy Blablacar’s

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.360
analysis and they will

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.980
be lucky.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.820
What we will do is analyze it from

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.640
many perspectives and they will see

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.780
it throughout the master’s course.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.900
I advance, because the value proposal,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.120
segmentation, early adopters, we will

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.360
talk about that, we will talk

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.780
about your funnel, how you capture

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.780
customers in online marketing, offline

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.920
marketing, we will talk

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.860
about how you manage the team,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.420
how your job is, your role

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.400
as a CMO, etc.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.960
But before all that, I

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.860
would like to briefly

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.400
analyze the Blablacar model.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.980
Basically, what it consists of,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.300
what you offer to each side and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.840
how you make money.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.460
Blablacar is the largest social

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.340
network for long-distance

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220
travel by car.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.860
At the end of the day it is a marketplace

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.680
and we are responsible for providing

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
that technology layer to an application

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.620
that makes it possible for

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.840
people who will take a same trip

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.520
to coincide to do so and can be

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.480
contacted to share travel and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.040
so share associated expenses.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.120
I will analyze some of the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.100
things you said.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.200
You talked about marketplace.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.720
This in The Power Envié we enter

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.500
into much detail in platform

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.540
models, but basically a marketplace

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.560
is a model in which, or any

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.400
platform, the main feature

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.340
is that it has two customer

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.080
segments and you do not have

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.960
two sides.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.780
What you do is connect them.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.300
So the way to generate value for

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.380
them is to connect them, as you

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.800
said.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.020
You are the technology.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.140
and exact.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.700
This has a number of challenges and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.560
a number of benefits.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
The challenges are that if you don’

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.040
t have enough critical mass on both

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.180
sides, imagine that you only have

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.120
drivers or only passengers,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.160
because there is no value.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.260
This is a linear model

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.440
where you add value from

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.420
the first customer to

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.000
the last.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.220
What it gets is the critical mass

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.040
on both sides, generating

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.960
a brutal entry barrier.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.480
How many users are you in Spain

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.960
right now?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.060
We have been in Spain for over 10

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.220
years and have over 5 million users.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.360
And what actually allows it is that

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.820
it is a model that is very

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.780
easy to scale.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.840
We are present in 22 countries

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.320
and have a global community

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.960
of over 85 million

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.140
people.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.300
You talked about climbing.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.740
It is actually easier to scale

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.000
because you are not the owners

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.100
of the means of production, in this

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920
case it would be the cars.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.140
You are connected.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.960
The car is put by the driver.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.040
That makes you much more agile or

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.380
much more scalable or more flexible

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.520
in growth because you get to another

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.980
market and you don’t have to have

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.360
10,000 cars.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.900
You have to start filling

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.920
the marketplace on both sides.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.000
In fact, in the end we are a marketplace

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.420
and what we offer is that technological

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.060
layer that puts people in

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.100
contact who want to make

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.260
a common journey.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.580
We always have to remember

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.540
that our customers are

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.380
two, supply and demand.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400
In this case, drivers and passengers.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.120
Now tell us a little bit

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.820
about how it works, how

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.360
it works, what drivers and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.400
passengers do, how you connect

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.140
them.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.820
So, let’s say that they first have to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.720
register on the platform and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.300
when they are already registered

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.100
it would be the activation phase.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.660
Activation is to publish a trip in the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.860
case of the driver and to reserve a

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.400
seat in the case of the passenger.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.960
So, when a driver is planning his

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240
trip, there comes a moment in

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.280
the last step in which he says,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.940
well, choose a price at which

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.600
you want to publish your trip.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.380
Blablacar suggests a price.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.340
for automation of vehicles,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.560
etc.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.120
And we suggest a price of 6

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.900
cents per kilometer travelled.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.120
I go on a trip and he says, then from

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.920
Bilbao to Madrid, 20 euros.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.860
Exactly, they would calculate how

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.400
many kilometers there are from Madrid

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.720
to Bilbao and multiply those kilometers

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.260
by 6 cents.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.800
That is per person.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.420
Exactly by seat.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.120
That is the price per seat.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.480
So, every passenger who would

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.120
ask for a seat would pay that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.700
amount.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.080
And that price is, in the market,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.500
if we compare it with alternatives,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.500
VHC, train, bus, how is it?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.320
More expensive or cheaper?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.020
Usually cheaper.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.220
It is true that for certain axes,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.480
say axes of concrete tracks,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.300
depends on the trail, we have

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.180
more or less competition, but

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.160
it is usually a very affordable price.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.240
And then, when you have published

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.520
the driver, you have the price

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.040
suggested by Blablacar, but that

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.000
driver, because it is collaborative

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.720
economy, we do not set a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.600
price, but the driver can

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.820
increase or reduce the price

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.360
up to 50%.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
What do you do with the car or something

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.100
like that?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.160
This is what drivers decide.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.640
The reason for putting a limit is that

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.440
they can’t have an economic benefit,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.920
because in the end it’s pure collaborative

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.840
economy.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.280
What happens is that it’s true that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.460
drivers, for example, imagine

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.980
a driver who will be posting

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.320
by and thus attract more passengers.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.560
Well, and finally, how are

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.640
the income flows here?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.340
Where do you get the income from Blablacar?

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.880
Blablacar would take a small commission

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.660
of all the transaction value that

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.120
is produced, which passes through

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.540
the platform, say, and therefore

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.260
we take a commission.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.420
Ok, because already to summarize,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.220
two sides, drivers and passengers,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.340
you connect them, you have explained

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.360
some of the functionalities,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500
because you suggest a price,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.960
etc., etc., and what you

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.600
do is transact there because it

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.720
is paid in the app.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.620
and exact.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.060
At first, when we landed in Spain,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.980
we did not take any commission,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.300
because of the need to attract

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.940
passengers and drivers,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.920
and the payment was in cash,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.160
i.e. cash, and inside the

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.780
vehicle.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.680
Then, there came a time when, obviously,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.480
we put a commission and

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.960
there it went to online payment.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.260
With this online payment,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.600
we have achieved a greater

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.460
commitment.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.880
There was a greater chance that you

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.600
would be left in the run.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.360
Well, to earn money.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.260
Well, of course, Blablacar has

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.320
to live from something.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.360
You didn’t monetize

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.940
before, right?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.820
We didn’t monetize and the goal was

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.000
to try to capture more criticism

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.500
from both drivers and passengers,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.300
but, effectively, in the end, all

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.520
that technology and the entire

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.900
equipment behind it must

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.320
be paid.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.740
Well, that’s the challenge of many

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.080
platforms that come almost from a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.140
model sometimes classified,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.640
etc., and want to become this, a marketplace,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.720
because it’s that, otherwise,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.380
they’re not...

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.460
of course.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.900
Of course, when you trade money within

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.280
your platform it’s easy to make

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.580
money, monetize it, right?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.080
But when you trade out, either they

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.340

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.260

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.500

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.940
lost until we already put the moment

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.600
of commission.
