WEBVTT

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.950
You have completed the Power MBA.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.050
You have been a lot of months

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.970
learning, suffering and standing

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.890
us and what you have demonstrated

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.110
above all is that you are

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.390
a person who does what is

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.290
proposed.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.010
We give you our most sincere

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.670
congratulations.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570
From now on, let's hope you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.330
can share the knowledge and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.270
apply the knowledge you've

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.330
learned in real life.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.590
In real life, you trust

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.670
yourself.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.510
These knowledge will make you

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.950
make a lot less mistakes and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.250
especially you will reach

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850
a destination much earlier

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.450
than you would have come

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.410
if you had not done Power MBA.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.970
We hope you are forever

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.950
in our community

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.230
and think

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.710
great.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.730
After all this time I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.750
want to thank you.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.550
First of all, I want to thank you for

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.990
trusting in Power MBA and you who have

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.170
become a finisher because I want

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.350
to thank you for the effort

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.930
you have devoted and I am convinced

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.850
that this effort will be used

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.590
and you will make it profitable.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.350
Because as Hugo said throughout

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.030
the program you have acquired

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.570
knowledge that will help

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.570
you your goals.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.170
I'm going to end up with a tip and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.770
it's that if you have dreams and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.210
real goals be brave that you believe

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.130
the circumstances so that what you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.410
want to happen ends up happening.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.970
I am fired.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.730
By the way, you will have received

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.670
some email, probably two emails

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370
in which we have sent you the certificate

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.090
as a finisher.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230
We have certified it through a blockchain-

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.510
based technology.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.470
A big hug and thank you for everything.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.930


00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.190
I have guys.
