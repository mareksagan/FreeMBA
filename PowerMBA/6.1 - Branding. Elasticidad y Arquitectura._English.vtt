00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.060
Miguel, you have explained them talking

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.880
about brand elasticity, there are brands

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.320
that are more elastic and there are brands

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.640
that are less elastic and you have

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.600
put us the example of some companies

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.180
that there are companies that

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.840
have mistakenly tried to pull too

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.240
much of their brand and have ended

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.600
up failing and there are others that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.840
have done well because they are

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.300
aware of the elasticity, have

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.880
not pulled too much and what

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.460
they have done is, in some cases,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.100
have created new brands and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.920
if they wanted to grow have

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.280
created new brands.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.960
And this is called brand architecture,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.280
which is basically like managing

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.940
the different brands you have.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.720
I would love if you explained

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.240
what brand architecture is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.660
and gave us some examples.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.600
Brand architecture is to determine

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.560
how brands in a group relate

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.420
to each other, what kind of relationship

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.080
they have to have, and there

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.420
are basically three ways

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.320
in which they can relate.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.340
Everything is the same brand.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.560
For example, a classic example is Sony, everything

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.340
is Sony or Acciona and then you have

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.800
if you want areas, but they are

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.480
areas, they are not brands, they are

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.400
different things.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.880
Then you have action on water,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.880
you have action on energy, etc.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.880
The other is just the opposite,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.840
which is totally independent

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.580
brands, which is the case we

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.700
had put before Inditex.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.540
You have Pull & Bear, you have Zara,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.340
you have Massimo Dutti, only in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.940
terms of business people know that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.000
they belong to the same corporation.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440
The customer sees different brands,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.940
different value proposals, different

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.340
smells, different designs,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.480
everything is different.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.660
And that’s because it wasn’

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.040
t really elastic enough for...

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.260
I think Zara was the first of the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.680
brands.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.620
If you want to enter a little more

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.300
premium segment, the Zara brand

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.980
didn’t allow it.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600
Then buy, in the case of Massimo

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.220
Dutti was a purchase.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320
Either you create or buy to reach that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.220
segment that interests you and because

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.780
you are interested in moving an

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.900
idea of independence.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.160
Then you have on the one hand the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.000
independent architecture

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.200
option, on the other hand the monolithic

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.820
architecture option, in which

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.900
everything is the same brand.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.260
And then you have the one between

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.780
the measures of the two, which

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.260
is the architecture they call endos,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.820
because there is a main brand that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.320
endoses at the top or lower level.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.520
For example, Nescafé is saying from

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.780
the prefix that it is Nestlé, but there

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.080
are other Nestlé products where they

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.880
have Nestlé endorsement above

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.280
or Nestlé endorsement below their

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.320
brand.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.220
So good, it’s a type of endorsement

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.040
at the main or secondary level

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.780
that can come from using the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.240
same typography, using the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.340
same colors, using the prefix

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.600
or simply having the support,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.100
which is ultimately a brand

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.720
support or endorsement at

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.680
the main or secondary level.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.780
Could Coca-Cola be this?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.100
Coca-Cola sometimes uses endorsement

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.100
for some products, but generally

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.520
uses a criterion of letting

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.020
it fly independently.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.180
I’m not talking about Coca-Cola Light Zero.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.940
Coca-Cola is a kind of endos.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.440
In that case.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400
There are no summaries.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.140
You can consider Light to be a Coca-

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.040
Cola sumark or Zero to be a sumark.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.360
I think it has come to be,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.980
although it was just a product

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.820
development that has

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.500
come to be.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.360
It’s not always clear where the area

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.000
is, where the sumarca is, where the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.780
main brand is.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.400
In the case, for example, of the islands,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.300
all the islands of Mallorca have the approval

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.780
of the islands and you see the same color,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.880
the same typography and you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.000
have Menorca, Mallorca and all

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.900
with the approval of the Balearic

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.480
Islands.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.280
It is the endorsement.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.060
It is the endorsement.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.380
The endorsement is that you are endorsing

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.520
in some way.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.520
well is.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.600
Anida has the BBVA approval because

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.740
it is interested in moving that

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.080
approval, in a brand launch process.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.420


00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.320
Then, when the brand is already

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.820
sufficiently recognized, you probably

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.320
no longer strategically interested

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.940
in the approval because you are

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.020
interested in seeing more

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.060
specialization and more

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.760
independence in the brand.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.420
So, you always have to obey

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.460
strategic issues in the brand architecture

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.380
you endow yourself

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.420
with.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.580
Indeed, as you said, this is not

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.940
white or black and the lines are

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.100
sometimes fine.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.680
For example, in the case

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.820
of Coca-Cola, what is product development,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.860
what is brand new?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.180
The important thing is that we understand

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.120
the three types you told us

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.160
to be independent brands.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.200
Inditex is a completely

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.320
independent brand.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.740
They are monolithic brands,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.820
that is, for all your

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.920
products, even for all your business

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.820
lines, use the same

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.280
brand.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.800
Then the concept of endorsement.
