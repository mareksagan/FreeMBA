00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.420
Marc, first I want to give you congratulations

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.620
because you have a spectacular

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.400
company, you are 25 years old, which

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.380
has an even greater merit and

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.400
you and your company have a future,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480
a potential that no one knows where

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.760
this will come and I would like you

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.940
to tell us the first steps of how

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.900
the idea was born, how it arises,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.320
in what situation you are,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.800
how it arises and how you take

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.900
the first steps in terms of

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.880
validating it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.680
well is.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.120
That is, well, first thank you also

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.640
that you confessed in your

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.460
enthusiasm and answering your question

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.320
we at that time were working in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.100
a consultancy, we were working

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.300
in Madrid, the SED is now in Barcelona

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.940
and then well, basically the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.100
idea comes out of having

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:02.180
or that has user generated content,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.600
they say that the user generated

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.520
content has seven times

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.860
more or greater power of

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.980
recommendation than what

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.100
is branded content, the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.440
content published by the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.920
brands, in their instagrams,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.060
etc.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.940
That is, we will do to explain

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.000
it better to our students, basically

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.180
it is seven times more potent

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.420
what another person recommends

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.040
you, another user in your

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.620
social age than the impacts

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.980
you receive directly on the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.400
brand.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060
Exactly, that is, you have a brand that’

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.400
s called, I don’t know, Pepito, right?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.620
If you...

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.940
The Power MBA.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.640
Power MBA, for example, if you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.260
hang a post on your instagram,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.700
well, Power MBA, probably, imagine,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.740
you will generate hundred sales,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
well.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880
If that post hangs an influencer

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.860
or someone who is representative

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.920
in the sector, because it will have

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.580
seven hundred sales, it is

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.380
worth it.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.060
That’s the increase you have in recommendation

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.860
power, basically because

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.660
it’s very natural and that’s been

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.060
the whole of your life.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.960
What kind of soccer shoes did you buy when

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.060
you were a kid, what kind of soccer

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.940
players did you buy when you were

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.660
a kid and where did you see them?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.360
In the television.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.760
Now people don’t spend time on

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200
television, they spend time on social

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.820
media, on mobile platforms,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.260
right?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.760
I would tell you that the example

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520
of the footballers, we can take it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.640
a little further to your case and it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.860
is, not only of the footballers, but

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.420
the people you look at, your environment,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.800
right?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.160
At that time there were no

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.940
social networks.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.100
Exactly, that is, before you, that is,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.800
you could, for example, in the case of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.580
Tonteo Empatos, you could buy the clothes

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.020
you saw from your friends because

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.300
you asked them because you had them

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.200
next to you, didn’t you?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.300
Today that network of friends expands

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.840
to your network of friends on social

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.720
media, with which I previously

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.620
what I couldn’t do easily was

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.480
expand that network of friends,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.040
because I didn’t see my friends

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.380
on TV, didn’t I?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.340
It was more difficult to influence

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.840
me if I had no direct relationship.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.700


00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.500
Today, and this happens in Tonteo Empatos,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.260
because there is a lot of influence of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.680
fashion influencers, professional people

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.520
in the sector, but there is a very

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.980
good part of influence that is people

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980
of the street, that is, normal people

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.820
like you, like me, who has their

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.860
context of friends, right?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.960
Its micro ecosystem and will be 200,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.080
300 people and possibly has proportionally

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.920
more recommendation power than

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.940
that that has a super professional

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.540
influence, which obviously at

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.040
volume level generate extraordinary

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.320
volumes, but at the level of

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.140
recommendation power

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.600
is also very important,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.180
right?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.100
Well, that is, we are telling how the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.980
idea is born, it actually comes from

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.000
combining the social network with and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.260
adding this...

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.120
A buying component, that is, is

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.060
like you on the TV put on buttons

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.700
and say this I like, I

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.240
want to buy it, right?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.260
I see an ad of a car and on the TV

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.100
control I have a button that is to

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.940
buy and that would be fucking mother,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.340
right?

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.900
That is what we do.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.440
It is genial.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.500
In the end, it is when I have the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.360
greatest desire to buy, it is when

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.820
I see the product I want to buy

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.440
it, if I go home I probably forget,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.580
I have other problems and maybe

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.760
I don’t end up buying, right?

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.380
And that is the idea.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.420
This is the idea, this is the idea.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.300
So the idea comes up and what happens?

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.440
Are you working a day, you think

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.260
of the idea or whatever?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.040
How are the first steps?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.860
That is, in our case, I think

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.920
it was a case, it could be more

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.580
particular because we were

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.760
for certain months, before we

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.160
left the job where we were,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.340
because we were combining a

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.700
little bit of both, didn’t we?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.320
We were working

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.380
in the company we were in.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.940
How can you compare working in the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.280
consultancy with the most demanding

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.460
workers in the world?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.260
I know you worked until

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.440
11 o’clock, right?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.340
And more and riding at the same time

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.880
in the company, I think.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.700
It can be achieved by sleeping little.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.880
It is the only variant you can play.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.020
You work 24 hours a day, you work 15,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.600
16, you don’t have to wait any more.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.080
And, most importantly, I think it’s because

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.860
of the team.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.420
For a few months, we had a team

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.120
already working on the project.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.280
When you were there, you were

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.860
at the 15th.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.860
We stayed there for several reasons.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.180
One of them is because it’s a very good

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.380
school and then because at the level

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.660
of contacts, because it gives you, it’s a

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.820
bit of a trampoline, isn’t it?

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.980
It gives you a lot of contacts.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.020
And in those early stages where you

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.500
need investment from business angels,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.420
friends, colleagues, because it’

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.540
s important, isn’t it?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.180
And also because we were

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.020
finishing each of the two founders’

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.780
projects and we didn’t want

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.180
to leave it halfway, right?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.860
How was the first validation of the

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.240
idea?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.620
How did you do it?

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.120
If there is something in this

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.060
company, in the company’s DNA,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.080
it’s to test it all and be super

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.820
analytical, right?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.260
This in certain companies could

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.460
lead to being a very unflexible

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.640
company, very undynamic, unfast,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.840
etc., right?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.660
But I think grace is knowing

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.200
how much you have to analyze and

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.040
how much it is necessary

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.260
to validate your thesis, right?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.200
Or your chances.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.680
And what we did, then, was a beta

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.560
phase of the app, very read, only

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.300
for iOS.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.960
We launched the market, we started

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.560
testing first, i.e. some capture

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.700
channels.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.160
We saw a bit of what ratio

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.320
organic growth had.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.720
The minimum viable product, how

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.000
long do you launch it?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.080
We launched it in two months.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.820
In two months.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.800
Super very fast.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.960
A product that, that is, almost

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.420
behind it had nothing, had no backing,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.920
at the level of, that is, had the minimum

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.540
so that we could validate,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.580
didn’t it?

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.120
In the end, we were not going to be...

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.280
That interests me a lot, because in

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.240
Power MBA we believe in the philosophy

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.960
of lean startup, we teach it,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.540
but we are aware that many entrepreneurs

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.400
are struggling to get out with

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.380
the least viable product,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.280
for many reasons.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.360
Because they are afraid, because they

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.440
are ashamed, etc.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.060
And I would like to know, that you would

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.900
tell us how you got it, that is, when

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.340
you speak of the minimum, how much is

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:08.960
the minimum?

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.520
What does it look like now?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.860
When, that is, it looks like in

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.660
concept, that is, there are photos,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.100
all the buttons are on top of the

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.940
clothes, they can be bought.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.080
At the front end level it looks like

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.940
50%, right?

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.440
At the backing level, how does

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.080
it work, it looks like a 3%, right?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.120
That is, it has changed absolutely everything.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.180
So, too, because when you need

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.760
to scale up a technology, you

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.900
have to change things, right?

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.840
And we have climbed a lot, with which

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.520
we have changed.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.780
I think it’s important, because it’

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.020
s that if you can’t, one, you waste

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.840
time, you lose money, and maybe

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.580
that doesn’t work, and you don’

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.280
t have time to spin, right?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.680
and yes.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.580
Two months is really a success, that

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.140
is, in two months having the functional

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.280
application is a real

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.820
success.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.960
I have to say that this

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.600
is Eric Rice, the author

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.940
of Instart.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.060
Yes, yes yes yes

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.320
Well, then, you go out to the market

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.000
with that same viable product, you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.960
place it in the stores, etc.,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.340
and you start to have, how do

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.220
you validate it?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.480
Did you realize very quickly that what

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.380
you had was very powerful?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.020
That is, basically, we determined

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.020
which were the main KPIs

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.020
we had to validate.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.640
One was, then, organic growth

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.160
rate, the other would be retention.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.680
And once we had those major

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.600
KPIs tested with a minimum of critical

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.380
mass, we said, this makes sense,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.480
this always combines it with

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.420
your successive round

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.040
of investment, and you’re

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.920
growing, right?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.120
Yes, that is, you identified

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.240
the main metrics related to user

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.560
behavior, which was if you returned,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.800
if you converted and returned,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.220
etc.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.460
It was important to see how we measured

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.340
those cries with the market, that

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.480
is, because you can test it, but

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.600
you are looking at incorrect

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.280
metrics, with which you are based

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.060
your decisions on metrics that

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.940
don’t, or market responses

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.680
that are not what you really should.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.460
That has happened to a lot of people who

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.660
go out to the market and what they do

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.700
is, effectively, fix themselves on

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.600
metrics that are not the right ones.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.820
For example, it is fixed on the number

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.580
of users.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.020
So what you do, invest money,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.080
capture a lot of users.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.800
Well, but it turns out that the most

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.060
important metric is not that, the

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.320
most important metric is the representative

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.660
of whether they use it or not,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.040
right?

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.940
and exact.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.740
I think it’s important to look at which

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.320
segment or in which sector you’

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.680
re in, what is what...

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.480
That is, one of the ways you can

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.140
try to get that validation is

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.580
to make sure that they do other models

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.860
similar to yours and what they

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.000
value, for example, investors,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.180
who are in the end experienced

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.620
people in the sector, are people

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.360
who when they look at your business

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.100
will look at it with certain

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.720
parameters, so, hear, look

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.500
at these parameters and you

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.400
will see what you have to get

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.900
there, right?

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.740
And that is important from the beginning.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.200
We’ve always tried to put around

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.600
us very good people, who know

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.220
different things and who

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.380
can help you in setting

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.460
that path, right?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.900
You talked about using metrics

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.760
that investors like.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.460
I think I’m more supportive

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.700
of using metrics that help you

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.760
learn internally.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.300
Because then, more than investors,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.560
because in some case investors

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.600
can be, I won’t tell you to fool,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.080
but investors can be offered

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.060
a photo, I don’t know, sweetened

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.860
by means of metrics as

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.060
they can be more absolute,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.080
you know?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.220
As they can be, then, is what we

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.920
said, the number of users or in

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.800
some cases the total sales,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.900
but those metrics can be, you

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.220
can have doped them by means

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.220
of marketing investment,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.900
you know?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.180
I think the most important

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.500
ones are those that are

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.440
directly related to the

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.980
behavior of the users.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.200
Basically, the representatives that

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.100
what you have is like them and

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.760
they will continue to use it, right?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.000
Yes, here everyone, sorry, I

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.100
think each has to mark their

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.540
metrics.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.660
You asked me how we can do this

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.020
or how someone can know what

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.860
metrics should look at.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.620
Obviously, then, one factor is

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.340
how someone who will analyze your

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.620
business will measure it.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.600
We don’t work to get metrics

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.720
for investors, we work

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.180
to get our own metrics

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.080
and that’s important,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.360
it’s aligning the entire

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.260
company to those metrics,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.060
isn’t it?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.900
And the entire workflow of each

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.760
person within the company

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.120
has to make sense to get

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.800
those metrics.
