WEBVTT

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.390
We will look at the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.450
four main factors of

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.190
the marketing mix following

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.610
the 4P and 4C

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.330
model.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510
Well, I want you to know that the 4Ps is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.930
the most well-known model of all,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.430
however there have been several

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.290
revisions, for example sometimes we

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.730
talk about the 7Ps and they incorporate

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.810
three more and the one we will see

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.950
today is the review of the 4Ps

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.310
to the 4Cs.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.450
We have both on screen, the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.470
traditional model of the 4Ps

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.930
incorporates the product, the price,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.630
the promotion that is how we will

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.590
do, how we will make our products

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.930
and services known to our customers

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290
and the pleasure or distribution

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.230
that is how we will make

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.090
our products and services

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.990
come to our customers.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.370
Well, there is an

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.910
update that we like more because

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.930
it’s more and I’ll explain

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.650
this.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.150
The 4Ps all have a product-centric

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.190
or organization-centric approach,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.070
they define themselves from an

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.770
internal perspective, our

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.910
product, our price, where

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.070
we will place our

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.470
products, etc.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.290
However, the 4Cs is a more

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.850
customer-centered review and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.870
we will understand it well if we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.490
see the evolution of each of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.230
the factors.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.690
From product to customer value, the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.990
only thing that matters to the customer

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.090
is not the characteristics

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.630
of the product itself but the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.590
value that it generates.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.010
From the price we go to the cost that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.330
is what matters to the customer

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.670
and also not only the price that

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.430
in many cases is an increased or decreased

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.170
cost because it is not only the price

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230
that the seller puts but is the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.650
cost that has for you the consumption

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.130
of that product.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.210
From the promotion, which is how companies

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.090
give to know their products,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.170
really the customer from the customer’

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.730
s perspective is communication,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.370
what messages come to me, how I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.750
communicate with that company and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.810
finally the pleasure that is distribution

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.670
from the customer’s perspective,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.510
the key factor is convenience,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.090
that it is more convenient or

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.470
not for me to access or

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.430
consume those products and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.110
services.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.950
And what we’re going to do is let’

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.590
s look at each of the factors in

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.950
a bit more detail and what I’m

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.670
going to do is within each of the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.870
factors share a series of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.210
points or a series of bullets

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.210
that you could have in mind.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.310
This is not a definitive classification

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250
but it can help you understand

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.510
well what we are referring

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.770
to when we talk about each

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.230
of those factors.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.310
And what we’re going to do is we’

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.550
ll do them together the four

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.050
P’s and the four C’s because I think

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.790
they’re perspectives that are

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.270
complementary.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.850
We start with the product that from

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.890
the customer’s perspective is the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.330
value delivered to the customer.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.570
What should we consider here

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.870
when developing a marketing

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.250
plan or when we analyze a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.490
company’s marketing plan?

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.090
Well, then key factors such

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.850
as what are the benefits, needs,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.450
problems that our product is

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.730
giving solution to or what

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.250
is the difference or competitive

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.490
advantage that our product

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.850
has over the rest, over

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.070
the competition or the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.590
brand.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.050
A brand is something that is very

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.550
related to the product because it

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.150
determines the value perceived

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.650
by the customer.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.690
We have to talk about the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.570
product characteristics, functionalities,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.530
design, packaging,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.330
etc.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.010
It is a key part of the product definition.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.730
What features or features

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.170
will we incorporate

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.390
in this product?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.130
But look, that not only are the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.570
most physical characteristics but

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.190
also if we think about the value

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.350
received by the customer because

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.590
we have to define the after-sales

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.550
services, we have to define the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.370
customer experience and also finally

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.910
to define your product portfolio

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.530
strategy you will have to take

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.430
into account factors such

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.230
as the product life cycle, within

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.750
our products at what time

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.450
of the life cycle are or we would

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.470
have to analyze for example

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.350
through tools such as the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.070
Boston Consulting Group matrix

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.350
that we will see, which with the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.630
next of the factors that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.730
is the price.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.290
The price is from our perspective,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.530
from the perspective of the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.530
company but for the customer

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.050
what is a cost.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.270
And here we have to consider a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.610
number of factors, for example,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.150
how will we set the price?

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.930
We will either fix it from

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.210
our internal costs or we will

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.410
fix what our competitors do or

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.670
we will fix the price based

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.910
on the value we are providing

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.070
to our customers that is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.110
the ideal.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.770
One issue you have to consider and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.410
is to incorporate the customer

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.890
perspective is the total cost

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.170
it has for the customer and

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.610
I will give you an example.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.230
Sometimes it can be that buy I don’

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.730
t know, certain product on Amazon the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.550
product is more expensive than if

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.650
we buy it because in a point

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.050
of sale.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.750
However, the cost for me as a buyer,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.090
even though I pay a little more

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.410
for that product, in the end

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.670
the cost is lower.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.950
Not only economic but it can be

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.190
even economic because I don’t

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.470
have to move to buy it but

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.790
also the effort.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.870
Therefore, it is very powerful to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.270
stop thinking only about the price

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.310
we put, 25 euros and think about what

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.190
the cost is, what the effort it

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.790
has for the customer.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.150
When we define the price what

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.210
we have to do is benchmarking,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.870
we have to fix ourselves on what

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.870
the rest is doing.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.990
We need to think about how the

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.450
price affects the positioning

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.050
of our product.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.330
We have defined the positioning

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.350
previously but it is that

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.350
many times if we make too

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.730
aggressive discounts etc.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.770
we can be destroying our positioning.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.710
One of the most important factors

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.630
is price sensitivity.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.590
If we increase prices, how

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.810
will demand change?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.950
If we lower prices, how

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.370
will that affect demand?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.330
And we have to think about concepts

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.590
or factors like whether we will

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.930
make more or less discounts, promotions

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.070
and play with all kinds of

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.130
tactics.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.010
By the way, in the price we would

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.350
also have to take into account, for

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.650
example, the form of payment that

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.110
in many cases will condition the

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.070
cash flow or the profitability

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.110
of our business, our marketing

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.590
plan.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.190
We go with the promotion that from

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.770
the customer’s perspective is communication.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.910
We have a product

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.450
or service, but how

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.830
do we get to know

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.870
our customers?

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.910
And here we have different options.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.390
We can choose online marketing,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.910
we can choose offline

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.130
advertising, we can choose

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.790
to have a sales force, a

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.710
sales team, we can choose

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.970
public relations.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.570
But really this is always a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.670
mix because in the end what

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.870
you do is use all the leverage

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.330
you can incorporate to your

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.210
goals.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.790
And finally we should understand

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.910
well what it consists of, which is sometimes

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.330
the most complicated thing to understand

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.930
the fourth P that is the P of the

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.810
place or of the square, which can be

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.030
the distribution.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.850
From the customer’s perspective,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.170
it is convenient.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.110
Basically what we have to

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.490
answer is how we will

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.770
make our product, our

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.830
service to our customers.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.910
How and where will we buy the product?

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.510
How and where will you use this

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.330
product or service?

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.330
As you can see, it is the most

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.950
difficult P to understand of all, but

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.850
if we see the concrete factors we will

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.750
understand it well.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.050
You can choose whether it is online,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.670
purely online or through traditional

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.490
retail.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.810
Online we will have to send it

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.970
home and in the retail we will

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.550
come to buy us to points of

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.190
sale that can be own or can

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.130
be third parties.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.970
Therefore, we must also

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.010
determine here our distribution

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.070
channel strategy,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.830
a direct strategy or

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.030
an indirect strategy.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.870
We will have to consider the

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.130
advantages and disadvantages.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.830
If we have a direct selling strategy,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.750
we will save the margins

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.230
of intermediaries, etc.,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.410
but that has some repercussions

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.550
that we may have

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.770
to grow more slowly.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.870
These are all things that

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.710
need to be analyzed.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.830
If we have a point of sale strategy

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.110
we will have to think where,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.150
what coverage and within the

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.430
distribution strategy

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.550
there are different options.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.050
We can use very intensive strategies,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.070
be in many sites or be more

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.650
selective or more exclusive,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.290
etc.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.710
And always, obviously we always

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.170
have to incorporate in each of the

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.110
factors, we have to incorporate

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.250
the perspective of what is

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.290
what others are doing of the

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.290
benchmarking.
