WEBVTT

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.380
We have learned a lot of things

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.640
from Lean Startup and Customer

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.320
Development and what we will do now

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.820
is to review a series of reflections,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.180
the main conclusions or reflections

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.600
that are things you should

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.500
not forget.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.960
The first is that you shouldn'

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.860
t plan.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.820
What we have seen and said many

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.160
times is that business plans are

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.400
useless, not only are they

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.580
useless, but they are harmful

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.380
and we will explain

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.580
why again.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240
What happens when you innovate,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.320
when you launch a new project,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.800
product, service, company,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.460
whatever, that has a certain

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.200
degree of risk, is that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.620
usually what you do is to plan.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.380
You can call this a business plan

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.320
or not, but what you are doing

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
is to think, well, this is what

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.640
will happen, you put it in a document

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.980
and project it to, for example,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.280
a year, three years, whatever

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.020
it is.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.860
Why is this an error?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.620
Because what you are doing is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.040
giving of course what will happen.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.220
You are giving of course, to begin

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.320
with, for example, that customers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.920
will buy you, that they see some value

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800
in your product, but you are giving

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
of course thousands of more things

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
about which you will be wrong.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.120
You are giving of course that you know

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.580
what kind of customers you will have,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.600
the right price, the value they see,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.860
for example, that they like more

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.060
of one functionality than others,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.260
that you have to build the product

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.040
in this way.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.220
You are giving everything, of course,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.040
and I tell you, and if you have

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.900
experience, that you feel

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.200
identified with what I say, it is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080
that the reality that it tells us is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.720
that when you innovate, those

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.420
assumptions you are doing, those

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.340
things you have thought, are wrong,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.500
because I don't know, in 90 percent

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.340
of cases.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.100
Almost always reality surprises us.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.000
So what we can't do is plan,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.640
it's not to tell you that it'

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.200
s not good, what I tell you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.660
is that it's absolutely harmful

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.920
because it leads us to execute

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.540
on a approach that has

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.940
very many risks.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.940
What happens is that, as we said,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.640
in that business plan you have incorporated

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.140
a lot of factors that are assumptions,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.560
which are acts of faith

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.780
that you are doing.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.280
What we need to do is

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880
identify them all.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.060
We're going to change the way

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.620
we think, rather than planning,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.940
what we do is think, well, this

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.180
is what we want to do, this

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.300
is our target business model, but

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.040
we're going to identify what are

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.140
the hypotheses that will determine

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.800
the success or failure of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.100
this business model.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.260
What will determine whether we

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.160
are going well or not?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.320
This is a true science, we

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.440
must know how to identify

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.040
absolutely all the hypotheses.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.520
All those assumptions you are doing,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.100
customers will pay for this, the channel

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.920
will understand it, it will cost

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.920
us so much to capture a customer,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.180
etc.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.920
Well, instead of starting to run

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.960
from that you have thought, we identify

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.160
the hypotheses and the first thing

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.480
we will do is to permanently do experiments

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.100
as clean as possible, as soon

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.480
as possible, investing the least

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.220
money possible, but it is that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.180
your only goal is not to execute

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.620
that business plan, it is to validate

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.640
those hypotheses and what we will

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.320
do is to go learning, learning,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.000
learning always with this

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.200
mental approach to learning,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.660
to validate whether those

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.180
hypotheses are correct

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.960
or not.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.380
What you will happen is that in many

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.040
cases they are not, you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.440
have been wrong, then what

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.560
we do is iterate, pivot, as we

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.640
want to call it, we are

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.260
evolving that business model

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.500
and we are doing it on the go,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.900
as soon as possible.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.500
So we will be decreasing

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
the level of risk very much,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.540
we will be much closer each day,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.060
if you focus on it so, which is

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.000
what we learn in Powerland

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.660
Formula, you will be every

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.140
day closer to it to be

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.300
truly successful.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.680
And here we introduced the concept

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.640
of the minimum viable product, which

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.460
is the approach with which we build

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.700
the product with the aim of going

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.060
learning permanently, that is,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.700
we do not give for granted that

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.760
the finished product has to be

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.560
this, we invest a lot of time, a lot

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.660
of money, we go to the market with

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.440
that product, no, we are building

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.000
it progressively, but always

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.840
with the aim of going learning,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.800
going validating the hypotheses.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.320
Another of the things we learned

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.560
is that we have to incorporate a series

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.940
of metrics that are not the usual,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.680
that is, we have to go measuring

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.900
whether we are on the way or

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.120
not, we have to go learning,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.420
using metrics that are not sales,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.960
that is not the total volume of

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.260
users, etc., are metrics that

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.180
are representative of that every

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
day you are building something

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.620
that provides more value to the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.200
customer and we differentiated

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200
them from vanity metrics.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.420
You can invest in marketing and capture,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.200
I don't know, thousands of users.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.200
Well, that's fine, but it's a consequence

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.680
that your product is better than yesterday

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.820
or it's a consequence that you'

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.140
ve invested, I don't know, x

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.900
money in marketing.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.920
What we need to have are representative

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.000
metrics that our product

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.560
or service is better every

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.060
day, for example, conversion

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.040
rates.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.760
If you, in addition to investing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.060
in marketing, are attracting

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.820
traffic, etc., what you are

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.360
every day convinces more people,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.440
that is representative

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.200
of that you are doing

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.840
it better.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.940
These are metrics that are

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.560
more customer-centric.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.520
And finally, what we learned and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.600
this is very important is what

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.380
the phases of product development are.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.180
That is, all this we are seeing,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.100
all this cycle of identifying

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.440
hypotheses, doing experiments,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.860
building a minimum viable product,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.080
going learning, going learning if

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.480
we are going well or we are going

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.260
wrong and going on or going pivoting,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.680
etc., going building our business

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.000
model, we have to do it in a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.940
series, in an order, in a few

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.340
stages that are very clear.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.680
The first thing we need to do is to

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.520
validate or search for the problem

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.320
solution fit.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.320
That is, we have to validate that

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.460
this problem really matters something

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.400
to customers.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.880
By the way, in very many cases

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.840
the projects die here and that

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.820
in addition our solution understands

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.820
and likes.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.000
And this we have to do, because I don'

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.360
t know, the first week, for example,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.420
very quickly, with very

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.060
lean experiments.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.760
You really have to do it that way.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.240
If you do not do it and you

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.300
build the product, if you invest

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.680
time and money, without doing

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.220
this is a stupid thing, because

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.920
in a very high percentage of

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.060
cases you will realize that

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.840
this problem did not

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.940
exist in the mind of the

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.020
customer, that your solution

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.140
is not understood, that your

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.960
solution is not potent, etc.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.500
The higher the degree of innovation,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.740
the more you have to pay attention

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.000
to this, the more you have to do

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.980
prior experiments.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.280
The next thing we will look for is

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.340
the product market fit.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.800
It's that moment when you really

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.160
value what you have has

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.920
fit perfectly in a customer

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.000
segment.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.500
We have to create a minimum

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.100
of a viable product.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.740
If we have, we have

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.340
to develop our product.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.520
It is no longer worth small

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520
experiments, because we already

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.800
have to validate having validated a

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.960
little of the channels, the capture

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.720
strategy, that we make money, etc.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.140
This is the product

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.000
market fit.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.540
That day of truth that you notice,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.500
sales are shot, everyone calls

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.080
you, the media contact you.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.180
Well, I'm exaggerating, but

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.260
really what I want you to stay

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.280
with is that if you have doubts,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.260
you haven't reached it.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.120
Well, the big mistake, the big mistake

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.620
is that almost everyone does what

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.860
is validating of course that

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.320
it has product market fit and

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.680
what it does is go directly to

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.180
the later phases.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.140
What you do is push that product.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.400
And at the end of the day, what you

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.440
do is have a mediocre company.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.680
Why is?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.780
Because the best marketing strategy

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.080
is not to push your product,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.280
the best marketing strategy is

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.320
that you have done the tasks before,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.940
that you have evolved,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.180
that you have searched permanently

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.360
until you have reached

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.600
product market fit.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.560
And I tell you that that day you will

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.860
sell a lot, you will earn a lot

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.480
of money, you will grow a lot.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.120
The big mistake is that.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.660
The big mistake is to start pushing

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.640
a product that has not yet reached

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.940
product market fit.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.220
There are two main steps

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.540
before product market

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.620
fit where your focus has

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.980
to be to look for permanently

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.520
and after product

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.260
market fit.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.800
What happens when we reach product

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.520
market fit?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.720
Well, in this case what we have

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.800
to work on is on our

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.900
growth engine.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.880
We need to optimize the

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.740
different channels of capture,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.660
etc.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.800
What you have to do is

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.200
prepare the way to then

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.040
accelerate, then climb.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760
You imagine that you have reached product

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.220
market fit and you are put, I don'

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.680
t know, three million euros on the

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.120
table.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.800
For what?

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.100
To scale this product.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.900
You probably aren't ready

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.300
to do so.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.680
Well, that's why, before you climb,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.320
you have to look for some efficiency,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.560
you have to be clear about what

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.360
the path will be.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.800
And when you have worked this, it's not that

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.420
you're going to be able, it's that

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.200
you have to step the accelerator.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.360
At that point what you have to

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.960
do is scale and you have to do

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.600
it as soon as possible and

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.020
as aggressively as possible.
