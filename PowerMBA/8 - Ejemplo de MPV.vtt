00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.910
Roberto, in The Power MBA we have

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.570
analyzed Lean Startup in great

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.070
detail because we are authentic

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.270
lovers of methodology and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.950
have already learned to identify

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.650
the hypotheses, know the concept

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.730
of the minimum viable product,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.870
but I am very aware that to really

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.470
be able the day you face it to

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.330
apply Lean Startup is very complicated

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.150
and to be able helps a lot

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.130
to have visualized many cases

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.850
of how many companies have

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.150
done it, because if not, the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.410
inertia or the trend is

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.110
not to apply it, is to let

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.870
us take what we have always

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.930
done, by the palenolification,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.570
by the business plan

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.410
and by executing.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.570
What I'm going to ask you as an

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.470
expert in Lean Startup is to illustrate

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.430
us with several cases, with several

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.170
examples, in this case of how

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170
a minimum viable product

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.050
can be carried out.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.530
The first thing I would like

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.210
to say is that what we will

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.310
see here now are some examples

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.350
that are based obviously

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.630
on the Lean methodology and the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.590
concept of the minimum viable

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.710
product and then also on

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.590
different tools.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.430
The important thing about all this

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.890
is that we keep in mind that there

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.310
are many tools and many examples,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.550
but not all fit our

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.030
case.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.490
We have different tools that we

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.630
can or cannot apply to our

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.670
case and that we simply have

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.390
to make ours.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.510
Depending on the technique we

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.910
use, we will learn one thing or

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.690
another and apply it in one way

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.830
or another.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.870
It is true, because here there is no single

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.430
formula to create a minimum viable product,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.210
but what I am convinced is that if

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.610
you don't know the ones there are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.270
they won't happen to you because you

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.370
have to be very very very very very

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.130
very creative.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.550
of course.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.250
And once we know, we have already

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.430
seen some, once we know some

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.450
more, I think that with that mental

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.010
reference it is easier the day

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.270
you face to create your minimum

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.410
viable product, good because

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.090
to use some of the usual

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.370
techniques.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.030
Of course yes.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.690
One of the best examples

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.770
of low-cost products

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.450
is crowdfunding.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.370
At the end of the crowdfunding

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.510
by essence, by definition, what you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.330
have is a concept that can be more

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.490
or less evolved, it can already

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.550
have the physical product or

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.110
not.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.770
And then you put it on a crowdfunding

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.910
platform and what you are doing

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.170
is validating that the customer

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.770
really wants that product because

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650
it is already advancing you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.270
a capital or money when the product

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.530
you still don't have it and most

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.810
importantly, you haven't delivered

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.810
it for sure because that's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.590
the essence of crowdfunding.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.250
So by definition and concept

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.370
it seems to me to be the best example,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.590
one of the best examples

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.850
of minimum viable product.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530
Crowdfunding is perfect because you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.530
first ensure you have a feedback

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.550
with huge notoriety, that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.290
here what you want is notoriety,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.910
it is interaction, it is not notoriety

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.750
of your product itself.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.870
What is very important is that the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.390
platform itself is designed to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.550
validate products without having

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.350
them developed in the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.690
cases, for example Kickstarter

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.710
and also clearly has another derivative

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.130
and is that as you go well you receive

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.970
a lot of capital, something

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.910
that is already, it is a sum,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.290
it is an essence of many concepts

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.370
that in the end together

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.410
in a single tool.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.970
For example, in London, they

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.910
captured when drones started

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.950
to be a trend because they

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.210
captured even millions of

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.630
dollars with a design,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.970
with a concept and that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.430
then because in the end

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.850
it went well, they captured

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.010
a lot of money through

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.070
a crowdfunding platform

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.130
and then could develop

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.010
the product.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.870
If it's true, if I would like to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.570
highlight that not obviously as

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.790
everything is not so simple, it's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.130
not just having an idea,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.870
plant it on a crowdfunding platform

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.250
and already success comes.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.150
No, no, of course no, there is a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.730
lot of prior work, obviously it has

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.910
to be accompanied by the previous

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.390
phases, we are very aware of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.210
it, because obviously we

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.610
have to work well first what is

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.890
the concept, very well who is the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.530
customer, what channels, imagine

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.210
that you want to put forward

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.990
a crowdfunding campaign

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.150
for a certain product and your

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.450
customer is not in those channels,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.590
it is not online, because

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.550
then obviously the crowdfunding

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.610
will not work.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.250
Then there are some things to validate

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.430
before, it is not simply,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.190
I insist, without putting a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.030
crowdfunding campaign and it is

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.470
already.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.050
Another example, a landing

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.050
page, is a landing page.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.990
We remember a project, a startup in

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.710
which we were working that

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.850
was for the sport and in this case

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.670
what we wanted to do was an app

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.390
to put together, put in common

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.610
people who wanted to practice a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.710
type of sport in team and that

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.390
obviously the typical example, you

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.210
hear, you will play a football

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.150
match with colleagues and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.610
you miss two or three people

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.990
and you do not find.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.190
The concept we had was, heh,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.190
we're going to put up

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.810
an app so I can put that event

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.770
in that app and find those

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.710
two or three people that may

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.310
be missing to make the game.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.130
And we have a landing, a landing

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.650
that you then move on your social

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.190
networks, in some of the communities

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.010
and with it you get feedback

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.470
of whether people are really

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.410
interested in this app or

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.790
not.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.150
In the landing, no more,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.870
what you have to do is raise

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.810
a proposal of interest based,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.850
for example, on an email

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.530
and a few questions.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.850
You have to be very careful because if

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.010
you ask a lot of questions what you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.330
do is that people are willing to leave

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.310
you information.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.890
So the cleaner you are, the better

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.730
the results you will get.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.710
Landing has an advantage and is that

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.290
you can do it today and it is people

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.810
who don't know it and tools

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.030
like Unbounce, for example, there

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.030
are a lot of tools that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.150
allow you to create a landing page

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.340
without knowing how to program

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.530
in a day and esthetically

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.410
perfect.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.550
You can use this landing in many

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.250
ways, you can use it in personal

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.750
interviews by teaching it

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.130
to your potential customers

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.250
and seeing how they interact

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.050
in what they tell you.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.030
But also what you can do is, as you

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.850
say, bring traffic to the landing

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.490
and create a call to action and

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.270
measure and conversion if they leave

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.410
the data or do not leave the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.130
data, etc.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.910
If you have done some previous work

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.070
and already have some community,

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.150
because it is easy to send traffic

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.850
to the landing, if not, because

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.450
typical tools that of ads, today

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.510
Facebook works very well or Google

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.090
ads or some other to send

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.910
some qualified traffic to the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.350
landing.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.470
It doesn't value any traffic because

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.030
otherwise, obviously the conversion,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.010
the conversion drops a lot.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.350
And this in one day.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.790
In a day, yes, of course.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.530
We are talking about Lean, testing

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.770
and testing very quickly.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.710
The faster we can do it,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.050
the better results obviously.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.870
I am that comes to mind in many cases

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.370
of entrepreneurs who have been giving

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.250
it back to their idea for months

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.950
and making presentations in power

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.370
point such and such and wasting

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.770
time.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.490
And I could have created a landing

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.470
page on the first day, started

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.610
to bring traffic, pointed out

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.730
to your target audience and that

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.110
same day had obtained valuable

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.310
information about whether

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.550
they were on the right track

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.190
or not.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.490
of course.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.530
They have been doing it for

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.390
months or so.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.250
It is very usual.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.330
We have commented on it before, in

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.050
the end the concept of lean and

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.030
the concept of minimum time is

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.830
understood very well, but then

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.850
apply it, the truth, that people

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.790
cost you a lot.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.110
Well, we will try

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.570
to make it.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.070
Another example, another project

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.250
we have developed, for example,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.870
applying the off magician.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.750
We wanted to develop a cloud,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.950
a software, a software.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.550


00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.130
Developing a SSA is very expensive.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.510
Developing software is costly,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.830
because a health is even more,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.470
because it is ultimately on

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.650
a cloud platform, on an online

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.530
platform.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.330
What did we do to validate this

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.350
concept, this experiment?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.050
Instead of decanting for the traditional

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.990
development of the SSA directly,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.390
what we have proposed

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.510
is an experiment where the user

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.990
left us their data in a

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.070
landing.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.290
We downloaded the data locally,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.950
we worked with that data and

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.070
the result was put on the

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.310
landing and the customer

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.530
could download it.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.510
Then we did the complete cycle,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.450
the customer experience obtained

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.150
it without having developed

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.070
the health.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.450
Then it may seem a bit complicated,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.230
but in the end if you think about

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.570
it, it's not.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.130
It is simply a landing so that the

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.290
customer has that same experience

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.690
that they can have with the SSA without

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.310
the SSA existing.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.390
This is also a minimum

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.190
viable product.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.050
You spend a lot less, validate the

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.610
concept and learn about the way.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.930
This is another example of a minimum

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.270
viable product.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.290
It is that the frontend

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.150
or customer experience is the most

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.370
similar to what you want in the

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.990
future, but you do not have it developed

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.890
because it is that they develop

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.730
these are months and hundreds

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.430
of thousands of euros.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.730
Then the experience that the customer

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.990
receives is very similar, not

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.910
exactly the same, but very

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.730
similar and what you do is you as

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.390
an entrepreneur or as a startup

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.570
manually deliver the value bet

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.350
to the customer.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.910
Many times, it has not been

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.790
explained, but many times the value

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.490
of interaction really

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.610
is, that is, what adds value is

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.790
the interaction that is generated

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.310
from technology, but it

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.610
is not technology so.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.310
of course.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.110
Instead, entrepreneurs do what they

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.110
do is wrap up in technology,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.030
but they could validate that really,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.810
as you say, without developing

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.890
anything of code.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.010
Because what brings value is not in

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.130
particular that frontend or that

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.230
technology, what brings value is the

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.330
interaction that will be generated.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:38.810
That is.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.570
This is the most important

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.630
thing, especially at this

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.810
stage of our discovery.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.490
We must not forget that by applying

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.850
lean we are discovering,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.010
validating concepts and we see

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.490
if we will see if this

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.790
customer is really well identified,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.690
if we have a product-market fit.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.450
The most important thing,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.330
as you say, is the interaction.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:56.650
Why is it?

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.850
Because that's where I'm going to learn the most.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.170
And once I have those learning,

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.930
then I will be in a next phase,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.110
of accelerating or going

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.410
faster, and there I will

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.110
take the technology.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.090
Another experiment, other techniques

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.070
you can use are mock-ups.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.930
At the end of a mock-up what

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.190
you want is also to validate

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.070
a concept or concept.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.310
And in this case another experiment

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.010
that we have put forward is about

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.150
the idea that we commented before

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.190
an application for sports, to

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.610
find, we made some mock-ups

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.750
on tools.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.530
Do you remember any tools?

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.430
Oh, you are now picking me up.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.870
I used InVision once.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.450
Invisibility is true.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.550
Ninja Mock is another.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.770
There are many.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.150
With the fact that you put

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.810
prototypes or mock-ups on Google,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.630
you will find a lot of free, some

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.650
pay, depending on the functionalities

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.970
you want.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.270
And these tools also allow you

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.330
to make the customer experience

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.150
very similar to a real application

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.210
without having programmed

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.390
absolutely anything.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.430
It gives you a potential, a ability

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.210
to do experiments that was previously

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.170
unimaginable.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.610
Returning to the example, we put these

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.410
mock-ups and delivered them

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.830
to the customer, to the future customer.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.890
We saw how he reacted.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.790
In this case, what you need to do is,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.590
hear, this is the solution we have

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.050
put forward and what you need to do

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.830
is look at how it interacts,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.750
look at how it generates that experience

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.350
with those mock-ups and therefore,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.350
obviously, draw many conclusions.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.030
We did a very similar experiment

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.150
when we made a mock-up

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.110
with InVision of an

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.330
app on a restaurant theme.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.710
Programming the app would have cost

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.070
you 200,000 euros and we did it in

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.530
InVision.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.010
I have a job of designers, etc.,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.150
but I do not have much work.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.350
I have been working for a week

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.350
and we had the possibility

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.170
on the mobile, even with the icon

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.810
and everything, to navigate the app

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.570
in a very, very similar way to the final.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.970
And what we did was sit down with

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.070
potential customers and see how

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.190
they reacted and so on.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.010
And that saves you, of course.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.090
But there are many people who do not do it.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.710
And what it does is directly already

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.770
developing the application.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.470
And then you have very little waist,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.530
because when you have already incorporated

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.550
a functionality within the application,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.090
it has cost you a folder, it's

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.990
months of program work, etc.,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.910
and then it turns out that

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.130
that functionality doesn't like.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.730
You have already complicated your application

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.450
or platform, your website, etc.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.790
You have less flexibility to go.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.550
You burned resources that are

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.490
scarce, obviously, and you

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.770
generated some functionality that

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.030
wasn't entirely validated and now,

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.110
go back, because obviously

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.090
it's more complex.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.190
And already to finish I will add

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.130
about this of the mock-ups, what happens

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.790
is that it is true that there are people

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.590
in the launch phase that

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.790
already, there are people who already

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.750
understand this and do and use it,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.310
but, because I also know it, there

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.510
are companies, for example,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.770
in the application, who already have

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.590
traction, already have hundreds

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.930
of thousands of users, etc.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.110
So it seems they tend to forget about

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.510
that and when they add functionality,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.050
they don't validate it before.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.130
And it's really a mistake, because,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.550
well, for the end, and the risk

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.710
is even greater, because sometimes what

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.790
you do is complicate something

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.390
that's already working for you.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.290
You add new functionalities, creaturitis,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.490
which Carlos Sánchez called in an

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.650
earlier class and you are complicating

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.490
the whole proposal

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.010
to value.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.330
Validating new features

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.490
with a mock-up is a tip for

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.770
those who start from scratch

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.510
and have a product that

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.710
has hundreds of thousands

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.470
of users.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.270
I really like the precision

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.190
you do.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.430
It seems to me a mistake, but serious, if

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.630
you have a community and already have

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.270
some customers, not testing them with them.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.830
In fact, many startups

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.050
do the opposite.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.110
I, in the early stages, would struggle

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.030
or I would very much like to have already

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.450
a customer base where to prove that

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.490
not already, because it is really

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.210
one of the difficulties.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.430
You have little community, you have

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.170
few customers, it costs you a lot to be

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.890
able to make interactions and it

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.910
turns out that when you already have a

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.330
product you forget those interactions

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.010
and you are already going, as someone

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.730
says, in automatic.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.450
I think this is a very significant mistake.
