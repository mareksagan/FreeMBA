WEBVTT

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.940
We start.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.840
Every story has a protagonist.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.980
Do you know what

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.720
happens in most

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.240
cases?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.340
They think the protagonist

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.100
is them.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.300
All communications,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.260
in all communications,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540
are then placed in the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.160
center.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.100
If we go to the websites of many

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.680
companies, they talk about them.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.500
The good things they have done, the good things they have done, the good things they have done,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.880
the good things they have done, the good things they have done, the good things they have

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.420
done, the good things they have done, the good things they have done, the good things they have done.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.420
You know that customers are

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.080
not interested in your story.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.460
Customers are mostly interested

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.860
in theirs.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.780
They are basically interested in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.100
how you can help them.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.820
First, the customer must

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.980
be the protagonist of

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.160
your brand's history,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.280
not you.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.360
The next thing we will

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.900
do is identify your customer's

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.460
wishes.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.240
What do your customers want in

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.840
your brand?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.580
We need to do a very simple

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.020
analysis.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.540
I recommend you identify a wish.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.720
And I also tell you that the wishes,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.900
what we want people to have,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
are very basic and very primitive

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.860
wishes.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.360
There is always a basic desire

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.920
behind what you are offering.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700
It will be to have more time, have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.880
more freedom, connect with other

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
people, feel more fulfilled, gain

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.560
status, save money, accumulate

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720
wealth, and so on.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.400
Why is it so valuable that the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.700
first thing you do is identify

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.900
what your customers really

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.240
want?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.720
Don't get lost in how, don't get

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.440
lost in your product.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.880
What do your customers want from you?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.440
Because if you identify that and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.400
incorporate it, for example, into

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.580
the main copies on the website, you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.220
incorporate it at the beginning of

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.840
your story, what you get is to generate

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.960
interest.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.860
I share with you the Frank Kern

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.140
website that sells training

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.140
courses for around $4,000,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.160
etc., and knows what their

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.020
customers really want is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.220
to get rich.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.560
That is what they are looking for.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.500
So what he sells is that, the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.460
most consistent way to generate

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.080
wealth.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.840
The point.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.260
He has identified what he wants

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.280
and told you from the beginning.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.420
What do you get with that?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.560
If you are a target audience, you will

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.760
be able to get involved.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.820
Be ready to go with history.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.060
And I put this other example

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.300
on screen and it's in your dream

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.080
house.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.720
As you can see, they are not talking about how.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.800
The first thing they say is, do they

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.660
know what you want?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100
It's to find the house of your dreams

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.160
and have identified your client's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.940
desire and start the story with that.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.120
This opens up the tension.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.660
So what do we always

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.680
have to ask?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.100
What we need to do

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.280
is do the analysis.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.500
What do my customers want

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.100
from my brand?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.460
Let's go to the next section

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.640
and that's the problem.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.200
We know that the protagonist is your

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.160
customer and the customers have a problem.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.620
This is absolutely basic.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.860
A story without problems has no hook.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.760
And it's also that the story at

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.660
the bottom of what goes to history

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.880
is to solve the problems your

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.600
customers have.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.780
So if we do the problem

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.000
properly, the story was

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.100
much better.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.640
We will fool the customer.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.700
Here we give Story Brand gives us a recommendation

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.120
and is to incorporate the figure

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.220
of the villain.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.640
The villain is the cause of the problem.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.040
The villain can be a person or

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.820
it can be a fact.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.960
Maybe it is hard to understand.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.660
The villain can be competition,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.640
for example.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.100
The villain, imagine that you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.920
sell healthy products, can be sugar.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.160
The villain can be, if you sell

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.080
financial products, it can be the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.740
crisis.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.240
I do not know.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.680
But it helps a lot.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.220
Why is it?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.320
Because it helps to generate copies,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.600
because it helps to contextualize,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920
it helps the reader, say, to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.420
make the story more credible,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.020
to get more.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.240
Because there is someone you personalize

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.620
as the evil one, the cause

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.460
of the problem.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.840
Now, let's go to identifying the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.160
problems.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.080
Identification of problems is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.920
absolutely vital in strategy,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.940
in marketing.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.900
Why is it?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.240
Because the story goes that you

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.520
solved your customers' problems.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.360
If you haven't been able to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.400
identify the problem, you're going to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.260
do it very badly.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.140
So here the question is, have

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.020
we identified well what are

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.560
the problems of our customers?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.740
The protagonist of the story

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.400
is your client.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.900
We have identified what problems

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.360
your customers have.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.960
And now what we have to do

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.540
is position ourselves within

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.180
that story as a guide,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.920
as a help.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.540
Always on, if you look at almost

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.520
every story in the movies,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.340
someone appears to help

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.120
solve the protagonist's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.900
problems.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.100
This must be your brand.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.420
Well, because to get this you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.720
have to work on two levers

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.480
to be credible.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.100
You have to be empathic or

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.220
you have to be empathic.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.840
You have to prove that you know

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.940
your customers' problems.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.340
So, if we did the previous exercise

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.640
well, it's much easier

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.520
to do it.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.920
You don't have to have your

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.380
customer's problems.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
Let us not be mistaken about that.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.900
What you need to do is understand them.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600
The second step is to create that

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.340
authority.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.060
You have to position yourself

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.820
as a figure that can help your

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.920
client solve that problem.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.420
It's like when you meet someone.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.640
When you meet someone else,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.520
you are doing that analysis.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.240
Do I like this person?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.820
Do I give this person credibility?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.040
In the case of companies, it

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.780
is the same.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.140
Your clients, your potential

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.440
customers will diagnose this.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.740
How can you generate authority?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.580
Well, since companies are constantly

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.840
looking for the generation

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.800
of that authority, positioning

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.280
themselves as experts in their

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.620
area, showing other projects

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.520
they have done.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.580
For example, by putting on the website

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.960
the media that have spoken of that

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.600
company.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.060
Another example is using

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.860
customer testimonials to

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.720
give trust, etc.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.780
All of this is tactics to generate

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.740
that authority.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.180
Therefore, what we have to do

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.620
here is to identify and write

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.500
in the model what we are going

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.820
to do to generate empathy

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.600
and to generate authority.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.160
At this point, this point where

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.400
we have identified the protagonist

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.500
has a problem.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.020
We have already positioned ourselves

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.160
as someone who can solve this

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.680
problem.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.480
We're in a good place, but I tell

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.060
you that if we stay here, the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.060
customer won't buy.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.140
The customer usually has

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.180
a lot of doubts.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.420
That is why we need to have a plan.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.680
Per this is a little more complicated

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.540
to understand, but it helps a lot

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.860
in the history of the company,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.960
on the website, in all communications,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.660
telling the customer what

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.660
the next steps you

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.840
have to take to buy you or

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.360
to use your product, etc.,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.400
generates a lot of

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.060
confidence.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.180
Look at this image.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.600
If we stay here, the customer is

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.460
in that point.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.640
You may be interested in getting to the

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.760
other side, but you have thousands of

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.440
doubts.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.080
We all have thousands of questions

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.360
when we know about our products.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.040
And those doubts what they do is that

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.740
you don't buy.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.240
You have to move forward

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.940
and you have to build that

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.720
bridge.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.940
You have to help him visualize

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.320
what steps he has to take

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.000
to that benefit, to solve

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.060
that problem.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.020
And share on screen the Afeiter's

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.980
website, which is a company

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.980
of our friends, which is

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.660
a subscription of

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.480
shave knives.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.940
You pay a monthly fee and

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.000
get knives every month or with

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
the biodicity you determine.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.820
I am a client and it works fantastic.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.040
Fix on the website directly

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.380
what they do is that they

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.400
explain to you very simply,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.980
in three simple steps, what

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.860
is next you have to do.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.300
Why is it?

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.760
The idea sounds very interesting,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.880
but you can immediately

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.740
get in doubt.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.600
How does this work?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.820
I share the case of Wix, which

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.480
is sure to be a company you

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.000
know because it publishes a lot.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.600
It helps you create websites

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.760
in a very simple way.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.700
The idea is very powerful, but it

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.440
raises a lot of doubts.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.720
You are able to visualize the

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.180
benefit, but it is more difficult

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.340
to imagine how the way will be.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.900
And they, fix them, put it

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.240
directly, that's the head of

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.660
the landing.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.060
The first thing they put in are

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.860
the steps, because they are aware that

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.980
their client is on the other side of

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.100
the abyss and can't imagine what

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.040
steps he has to take.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.360
So the question, the diagnosis

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.220
we have to make here is,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.800
have we set up a very simple

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.900
plan to understand to explain

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.520
to customers what is what

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.360
they have to do to do

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.960
business with us?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.000
We have to make a diagnosis

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.520
and we have to explain it.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.420
Next is the call to action.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.280
In every story there comes a

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.320
person who will help you, who

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.720
are us, but we have to ask the

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.300
customer to make the decision.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.120
He will not do it alone.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.880
I guarantee you that he will not do it alone.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.190
And here the advice is that,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.670
the main advice is not to be afraid.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.390
If you believe in your product,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.830
your product is meant to improve

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.670
the lives of customers.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.710
So do not be afraid.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.290
There are very few companies

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.310
that exceed call to action.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.690
Usually, the companies, in general,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.250
what they do is be afraid

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.670
and not say it enough.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.470
Don't get tired of asking your customer

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.690
to buy because you believe in your

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.130
product and want it to do it and it's

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.350
the best for the customer.
