WEBVTT

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.870
We will talk about the most important

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.890
and broad concepts in strategy

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.250
and marketing, which is segmentation.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.570


00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.030
We could be talking about this

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.910
for days, but I want you to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.950
stay with a few concrete lessons.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.150
What is segmentation or

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.190
segmentation?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.470
Well, it is very simple.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.970
Basically it is from the total population

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.670
or what we do is to introduce

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.090
a series of variables that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.030
allows us to identify

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.030
segments, which are groups,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.710
and each group shares common

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.070
characteristics that can be of

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.230
different type.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.970
But basically what allows

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.770
us to segment, thanks to those characteristics

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.890
that they have in common, is

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.390
to adapt our value proposal,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.650
adapt the channels, adapt

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.510
the strategies and all marketing

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.590
to be able to reach them

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.650
more effectively, more

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.910
efficiently, etc.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.210
The question is, how is it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.870
segmented?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.070
How will we do this?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.470
We have the total market and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.590
what are we going to do to identify

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.290
those segments?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450
The key criteria are the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.110
variables or segmentation criteria.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090
What variables should

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.750
we use to classify?

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.650
We can segment the market according

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.490
to where they live, which is geographical

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.330
segmentation.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.310
We can segment the market according

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.630
to variables such as age, gender, income

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.010
level, whether they are married or

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.730
single, at what point in their

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.190
life they are, whether they

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.450
have a university degree, if they

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.730
are millennials, etc.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.570
These two variables, geographical

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.630
and demographic, are the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.010
most traditional segmentation variables.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.590
In addition, we can segment according

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.710
to the profile, which is called psychographic

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.790
segmentation.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.410
And what is it we will do?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.550
Well, we will identify profiles,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030
which in many cases interest us

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.410
because they are our target

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.790
audience, and we will put them

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.390
a name, we will describe them.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.530
Imagine that they are

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.650
more innovative, unconformist,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.190
traditional, classic,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.810
urban, etc.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.970
We will describe those profiles and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.610
we will segment the population according

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.790
to that criterion.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.610
These first three we have

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.490
seen, we have seen geographic

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.890
variables, demographic

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.850
variables and psychographic

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.350
variables or by profile, which

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.330
allows us, after all, to analyze

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.930
or identify who our customers

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.630
are.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.470
And why?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.010
Because knowing who they are,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.070
we know, allows us to address them.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.850
This is very obvious.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.130
It helps us in the capture

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.990
and growth strategy.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.990
If you don’t know who your customers

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.810
are, you don’t know where to go

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.510
and find them.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.690
This is the first of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.170
the exercises a company has to do.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.510
Who are my clients?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.370
And you can do so using these three

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.850
variables, where they live, what their

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.170
demographic data is and what

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.470
profiles they are.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.780
We can also segment our

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.200
current customers, our

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.420
potential customers, the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.500
market, based on behavior.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.640
This is what is done, but based

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.760
on behavior as customers.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.900
So far, what we have done is to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.920
do an objective segmentation

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.400
of who they are, how they are,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.860
and where they live.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.600
But now what we will analyze is all

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.100
the information we have in the CRM,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.000
in the different systems, from

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.800
the interactions that have been

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.680
generated with customers and we

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.080
will segment the customers.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.260
And here I want you to keep in mind

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
that with the growth of the Internet

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.600
we have so much information

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.760
that we can do one-to-one segmentation.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.260
What information can we analyze?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.020
We can analyze information such as how

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.520
much money they generate, how much

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.920
we are selling them, what is the profitability

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.020
that each customer provides us

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.400
and segment, whether they are loyal

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.020
customers or not, what is the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.220
urgency they buy us.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.660
We can segment based on all these

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.620
variables, how they have known us

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.340
and we could go to a level of

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.720
greater detail and analyze, for

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.100
example, the time they have

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.000
spent on our website, how many

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.360
campaigns they have clicked,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.120
how many of the emails we

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.120
have sent them have opened, etc.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.740
As you can see, these are examples

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.100
that I want you to understand

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.560
all the information we can collect

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.780
from these customers and that allow

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.840
us to make segments based on

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.280
the behavior they have had with

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.100
us, with the aim of adapting

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.080
the proposals, channels,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.480
etc.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.180
What is it all for us?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.660
What is the use of measuring

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.360
and segmenting customers

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.160
based on their behavior?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.540
Well, mostly I think it

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.760
tells us what works.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.800
Remember that this is historical.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.420
We measure everything that is

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.540
happening to them.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.700
We can draw conclusions of

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.360
what is working in all

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.480
customer interactions and

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.080
from this conclusion of

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.140
what is working and what

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.180
is not working, what

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.260
we can do in the end, what

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.080
allows us to optimize.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.700
Optimize what we do in customer

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.600
capture, for example.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.460
If you know, you are measuring what

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.280
are the campaigns that are in addition

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.560
we can optimize the development of

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.680
each of the customers, that

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.060
is, sell more, earn more money

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.480
with each of the customers.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.120
Why is?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.220
Well, because we are measuring

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.600
and we are segmenting customers

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.720
based on how much they are generating

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.120
for example, or what products

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.040
they are buying and all the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.360
efforts we make can be

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.700
adapted to that.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.500
Let us take a look.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.580
So far, what segmentation has done

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.660
to us is that customers, we already

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.280
have different segments of who our

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.560
customers are, we already know who

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.820
we have to go for and also the segmentation

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.140
by behavior allows us to understand

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.040
or go understanding what

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.000
is what works and what is what

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.400
doesn’t work, because we are

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.740
measuring everything, but

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.000
we are losing a lot of

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.040
things.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.840
Remember that mainly consist

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.800
of providing solutions or generating

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.230
so we have to segment as

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.230
well or we have to incorporate

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.510
the perspective of what

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.790
are the problems, challenges

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.850
and needs of customers

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.250
in relation to us and

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.630
this cannot be measured.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.810


00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.310
This is a much more complicated investigation.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.110
We have to analyze what is your motivation,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.290
what is your challenge, whether we are

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.770
giving you a solution or not and this

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.930
will allow us to really understand

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.890
the reasons.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.630
Why are they buying us or not buying us?

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.150
And from this knowledge, which

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.030
we can develop, for example,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.370
with the empathy map, which

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.390
is a tool we will learn to

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.510
use, we can absolutely

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.170
evolve our value proposal

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.930
to adapt to those needs, to

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.250
those problems, to those

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.410
challenges that customers

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.210
have.
