WEBVTT

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.860
We talked about the variables

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.020
of segmentation.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.860
We have explained what are the ones

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.840
that were traditionally used, geographical,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.640
demographic, etc.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.220
We have entered segmentations

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.300
based on what you buy, what

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.660
is the benefit, when you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.200
buy, etc.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.520
In the end, what you have to do,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.880
and you did it very well, is to

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.140
use all the variables, that is,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.600
to study a customer from many

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.160
different perspectives.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.800
And if you do all that well, at the end

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.880
you have a lot of information that allows

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.740
you to adapt, because what you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.200
offer, how you get to it, etc.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.480
What you did is that this seems

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.580
very brilliant to me and I would

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.440
like to analyze it.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.400
I suggest that we analyze

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.700
it first by looking at the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.360
perspectives you used to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.100
study the client.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.600
This is the different variables

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.740
of segmentation, which is what we

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.260
have called it.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.740
Which were they?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.260
In addition to geographical, demographic

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.360
and so on, that is already

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.900
over.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.340
What did you study about the client?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.740
A few years ago, I

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.280
thought it was basically

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.460
what I think all the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.400
brands did.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.600
You as a brand what you identified

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.020
was based on the needs

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.820
you really had.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.040
You almost looked more

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.600
at brand needs than what the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.800
consumer or the market

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.980
was really demanding.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.880
Then, from your needs,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.440
what you said is plus with

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.040
product for a certain woman

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.980
of a certain age,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
of a certain social

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.540
setting, etc.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.820
You develop the product,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.640
you develop the communication

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580
and when you already had basically

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.200
all that directly you put it in front

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.880
of a focus rub and you started

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.560
getting the feedback.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.240
This is a waste

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360
of time and money,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.300
etc.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.680
Because you realize that you had

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.600
developed almost complete

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.920
things without really taking

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.900
into account what the consumer

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.360
was demanding of you.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.060
Why is it?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.940
For at that time, what really

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.600
mattered was the brand.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.520
What is the brand wanting

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.340
to move?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.920
This is a one-way communication

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.600
with the consumer.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.360
What is happening?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.380
That all this has changed.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.620
From the moment you put the customer

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.480
as the axis and on what you have

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.780
to pivot absolutely nothing,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.060
you have to start determining

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.100
who that customer is.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.060
Who is there to buy you?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.060
For whom do you buy?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.740
Where do you shop when

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.680
you are online?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.660
What are the communications?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080
What are the different media

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.260
or attention calls that make

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.720
you see your product or see

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.540
your brand?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.240
Then you have to identify each of

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.880
those customers, which in addition

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.940
that customer is not a single

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.260
customer, but depending on whether

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.940
you buy during the week or weekend,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.460
their habit of use or purchase

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.780
is completely different.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.400
Whether we are in summer or in winter,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.700
whether you are on vacation or are

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.420
working, if you are traveling, with

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.000
your way of buying is absolutely

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.220
different.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.720
We segment the client according

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.880
to who he is, why, with what purpose,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.640
when, for whom, look at what

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.400
is interesting, for whom and then

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.940
all are very related,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.060
but well, but they are different

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.420
variables of study.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.240
When you buy, use, which is also

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.160
when you buy, where you buy, which

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000
is usually related and from

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.840
all that you identify we are no longer

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.420
counting the customer itself,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.140
Borja is not a customer segment

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.000
or another, but that Borja can

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.320
also be at one time is you buy

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.580
for this and at another time

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.640
you buy for something else

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.160
and from all this you put it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.780
in the analysis and identify

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.140
a series of customer segments

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.400
and mixed use and what

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.080
are they?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.400
Tell us a few things so we

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.980
can understand.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.620
From customers who, look, that after

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.420
all once you have identified

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.840
the customer you have to think that

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.320
you have to develop the product,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.200
you have to develop the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.560
communication and you have

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.620
to go to sell in those spaces

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.060
where really that customer

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.660
goes.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.520
That would be once you understand

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.140
well what your customer segments

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.660
are, what you adapt,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.040
channels, products,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.060
etc, etc, to each of them.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.140
Of course, if you don't understand them

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.640
well, it's that you don't adapt anything because

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.980
you shoot without knowing, which is what

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.980
happened to you at the beginning.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.040
Tell us a few of them.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.780
For example, we identify

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.340
different profiles that, said

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.020
that, I don't know if we take

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.360
as 10, but it could be 10,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.220
15 or a lot and in fact

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.600
also can be modified over time.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.480
But, for example, we had the typical

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.360
profile we called gifter, which

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.540
what I was looking for was to give.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.540
So what you look for when giving because

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.400
it is a profile that what you are looking

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.980
for is not looking at the price

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.340
or good, also depends on who, because

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.660
there is also a diversity depending

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.920
on whether you want to give,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.740
you make a gift and really get good

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.160
or it is the typical gift

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.240
that goes to visit a house and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.440
the only thing you want is to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.500
go directly to carry a detail.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.360
The use is very clear.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.460
The use is, in this case, to buy a

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.720
perfume with the aim of giving

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.600
it to someone.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.720
So, you are looking, you are

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.880
going to buy at a certain

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.180
distribution and you are buying

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.880
with a certain budget and a certain

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640
type of product, which is not the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.180
same, neither budget, nor place,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.140
nor product that we probably identify

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.840
as traveler, that is one that goes

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.360
super fast, that doesn't want

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.500
buying experience, the only

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.580
thing you want is to pick

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.540
up the product that is in

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.820
small sizes so that you get

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.960
on the plane and go as fast

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.640
as possible.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.780
You adapt everything, product, channel,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.120
everything, absolutely everything.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.120
Because the product, both sizes,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.400
that is, is not the same, another,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.000
for example, another profile we call

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.660
the lover, the one who loves the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.540
brand, whatever you do loves him,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.380
wants the storytelling you tell

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.440
him, loves him that it is the time

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.120
of the shopping experience, looks

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.540
for large sizes, doesn't care

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.240
the price, has an emotional

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.120
bond with the brand.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.000
It's more recurring, isn't it?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.920
Obviously, that product, that consumer

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.040
is the one you can sell perfectly

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.940
by subscription, because

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.320
you know that it will buy

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.340
you, yes or yes.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.620
Then, obviously, you have to go adapting

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.180
so much that product, for

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.440
example, the lover will go to large

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.720
sizes, he doesn't care the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.780
price, with which you can offer

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.480
him anything, even exclusive

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.140
editions, because he

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.040
will pay them.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.700
Is it easier to sell online

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.380
or not?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.520
Probably, if it is probably a recurring

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.160
product.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.700
He who knows it, well, well,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.920
but he likes to go discover.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.360
But he loves to go to the sales

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.240
account and have a assisted

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.640
sale on the lover, tell him

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.720
because this limited edition

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.320
has been made, which is what

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.060
somehow means size, the design

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.540
has been done by a certain

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.460
artist, etc.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.480
I love this experience, well.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.180
It values a lot and doesn't matter

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.380
to pay, because in fact more even almost

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.560
doesn't ask the price, which

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.300
is not the same case as probably

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.320
the one that comes, what you're

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360
looking for is the offer.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.140
What is the offer?

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.000
What is the promotion?

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.520
It doesn't matter if it's a fragrance

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.880
or another, if it's one size

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.380
or another.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.560
What I was looking for is the price,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.620
with which, in that case, anything,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.160
is that it is neither between that

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.300
half if it remains, nor the storytelling,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.560
nor where it comes from, nor if

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.920
there has been an artist involved.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.660
What you are looking for in this

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.500
case is the price.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.240
For example, the young people.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.420
Where do you usually

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.220
go to buy?

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.500
So, let's say, a channel like a

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.320
Sephora, well.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.420
At Sephora you will have to look for

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.500
products that are probably not the

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.940
classic of all life, but you are looking

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.020
for innovations.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.460
Innovations not only at the level

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.340
of fragrance, but innovation at

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.940
the level of what is how you buy

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.160
the product, because there is

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.740
no longer assisted sale, even

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.500
maybe at the level of formats

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.720
that are smaller or that

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.880
are much more fun, because

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.420
they are like more what they

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.900
call gamers.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.740
That is, you like fun, you like

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.300
that at the time of the purchase

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.900
it is really a playful moment.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.420
Well, I think this case is perfect

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.840
to illustrate something we have

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.540
taught, that is that you have to

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.820
study what we told the client

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.680
from very different perspectives

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.180
or segment what.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.500
And you have told us several profiles

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.800
or various customer segments that

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.680
mix for who the profile is, because

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.620
sometimes the psychographic

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.300
profile, demographic also sometimes,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.640
there will also be age issues,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.140
but many times what weighed

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.260
was the use, for what, at

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.120
what time, where, etc.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.200
But understanding that we ourselves

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.580
have those multiple facets,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.560
I gave the practical case

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.820
that happened to me personally.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.820
I remember that January 5, almost

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.780
12 at night, that were the typical,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.700
by English cut, I know they

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.980
opened until 12 because for

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.640
an experience and I missed

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.020
as two or three gifts to buy.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.440
At that point, you go to what

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.160
we call the rushy, that the only

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.040
thing you want is to solve a

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.960
problem because you have an

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.200
urgency, you have a need, with which

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.100
you care little already almost

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.000
the product and the variable price,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
because the only thing you

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.400
want is to solve a problem.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.920
And I have come to buy a product

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.240
that in normal conditions,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.480
at another time of my purchase,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.660
I would never have considered

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.540
either buying it at the level

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.940
of a product, or buying it

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.800
at the level of what the price

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.140
for which I pay.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.860
That's why I say that we ourselves,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.780
depending on the time we are, have

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.720
different hats and we can be lover

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.860
at a given time, gifter because

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.820
we have another gift time or costly

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.940
because what you're looking for

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.140
is actually a promotion or something

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.960
that's really a ganga or a traveler

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.300
that what you're looking

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.300
for is a small size because you

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.380
need to pick up a plane

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.500
and you need to go

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.120
fast and take it to you.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.760
And companies that understand that

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.680
they are able to reach this level

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.060
of segmentation, identifying

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.680
profiles, moments, uses, etc.,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.860
is that the information

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.940
they have to address that

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.440
customer, to use channels,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.700
because you are saying

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.700
the rushy.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.340
If you know that there are people

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.960
within your customers who

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.880
are in this situation, you

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.600
can advance through digital

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.520
channels, etc.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.780
Well, the possibilities we can't

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.040
deepen into this because they are

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.240
endless, but what we have to stay

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.460
with is that it's valuable

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.040
information to understand your customers

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.080
from many perspectives

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.680
and not.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.260
But what is super important is that we

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.540
don't understand it only at the level

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.000
of what is product.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.940
At the end of the day, this has to

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.900
be a consistency, that's what I

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.360
said, solistically it has to be perfect.
