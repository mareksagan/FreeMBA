00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.490
It is very important that we understand

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.290
the concept of financial

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.410
leverage well, what it consists of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.590
and, in addition, that we understand

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.210
it in an intuitive way.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.070
Before we get into the

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.210
financial leverage, letâ€™s see

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.490
what leverage is, which you probably

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.590
already know.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.270
The leverage rate is the percentage

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.490
of debt over the total

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.530
of sources or debt plus equity.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.610
Basically, it is how much the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.810
debt weighs, what proportion of

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.670
debt to the total of the sources of financing.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.130
The greater leverage,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.170
the greater debt.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.050
Very easy, right?

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.150
well is.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.370
What I want to understand is the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.730
financial leverage.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.350
That is, the positive effect

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.690
it has on the profitability of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.390
own funds, on the profitability

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.570
that we get the shareholders,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.290
if we increase debt.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.830
With higher debt, higher leverage,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.630
higher profitability for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.610
shareholders.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.170
Sometimes it seems a little counterintuitive.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.010
Let us see it with an example.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.250
We will consider a purchase-sale

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.390
operation of a home.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.530
The operation is like that.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.790
We bought a house, year zero, the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.510
price is 100,000 euros and the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.790
valuation of the house has

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.810
been 10%.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.170
Therefore, a gross surplus of 10,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.130
000 euros has been generated.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.550
We sell for 100, we buy for 100,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.870
we sell for 110, plusvalue of

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.850
10,000 euros.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.450
What happens is that we will

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.390
compare the operation that two

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.990
different people do.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.670
Person A, never made an MBA,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.110
has no financial knowledge

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.170
and, in addition, has 100,000

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.370
euros in cash.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.130
He decides not to push.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.990
The leverage rate is 0%.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.650
That is, the 100,000 euros are put

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.830
out of his pocket.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.470
The person B, who has certain

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.990
financial knowledge, regardless

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.590
of whether he has the 100,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.030
000 euros in cash or not, decides

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.550
to leverage and leverage

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.190
90%.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.250
That is, you buy a home that has

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.970
a value of 100,000 euros but only

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.650
puts 10,000 euros because the other

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.150
90,000 euros is a mortgage

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.690
loan, for example, which is the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.270
usual thing in the purchase

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.910
of a home.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.850
We have a 0% leverage,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790
a 90% leverage and we will see

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.670
what the impact of this is on the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.170
profitability that each one

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.690
gets.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.810
The plus-value of the two is the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.230
same, the gross plus-value, because

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.430
the two get a plus-value of 10,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.090
000 euros.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.230
They sold the house a year later

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.430
for 110,000 euros.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.390
In the case of the person who has not

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.510
leveraged, he does not have to pay interest.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.670
and a mortgage.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.110
In the case of the person who has

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.530
been leveraged, he has to pay the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.930
interest of that that if we are

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.010
saying, for example, we will

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.250
assume that it is of a 3% annual,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.430
about 90,000 euros he has to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.430
pay the interest of 2.700 euros.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.990
What is the benefit that one has obtained

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.650
and the one that has obtained another?

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.110
The person A has obtained a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.390
profit equal to the gross surplus

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.370
value of 10,000 euros.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.310
In the case of B, we had

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.970
to deduct interest.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.010
We will think, well, that it gets a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250
profit of 7,300 euros, but here the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.390
important thing, what I want you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.190
to understand, is the effect it

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.750
has on the profitability of the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.930
own funds, that is, the capital

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.390
they have contributed each of

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.870
them.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.230
The first has obtained

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.590
a profit of 10,000 euros on

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.130
a capital, on a own fund of

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.910
100,000.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.090
What is its profitability?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970
The ROE is 10%.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.910
In case B, it has obtained

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.510
a smaller profit, because it had

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.970
to pay the interests of the debt,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.450
but it is that the capital provided

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.810
is 10,000 euros, so the ROE

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.070
is 73%.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.650
As we see, this is the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.730
financial leverage, it is the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.030
positive effect that has the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.930
increase of debt on profitability

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.790
to own funds, but look, I want

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.530
to make a very important

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.190
mating, because this is

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.550
not always so.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.570
For a positive financial

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.990
leverage to occur, for

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.990
the effect to be positive

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.910
on profitability, a condition

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.050
must be obtained.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.730
One condition is the following, and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.070
it is that you are borrowed money and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.210
that money has a cost, which is those

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.890
interests.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.750
Well, you have to be able to

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.470
get with that money a profitability

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.490
higher than the cost of that debt,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.290
because if you are borrowed

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.870
money at a cost of 2 and you

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.770
get a profitability of 1, you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.930
will lose money.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.410
There is no positive financial

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.630
leverage, right?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.990
Let us see it with the same example.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.390
It is the same operation, which

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.970
happens that in this case,

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.570
instead of a revaluation of 10%,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.470
a revaluation of 2% annually

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.770
occurs.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.190
And we go to the bottom, in the case

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.450
of which it has not been leveraged,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.270
well, because it gets a

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.770
plusvalue of 2,000 euros.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.730
In the case of what has been

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.490
leveraged, here you are doing a

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.950
bad business, because you

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.010
are getting a profitability

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.970
of 2%, however, the cost of those

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.850
funds generates interest that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.370
is paying interest of 2,700

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.810
euros, therefore, you are

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.870
losing money.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.590
In short, if you are able to

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.890
get a higher profitability than

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.310
the cost of that debt, yes,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.710
you have more debt, you get a

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.270
higher return on the investment,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.890
which is the financial

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.250
leverage.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.770
If, on the other hand, the return you

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.450
are getting on your investment is lower

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.170
than the cost of debt, it is better,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.130
obviously, that you have no debt.
