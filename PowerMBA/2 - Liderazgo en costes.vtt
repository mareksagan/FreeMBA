00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.640
Today we will go deeper into one

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.980
of the generic strategies that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.540
is cost or low cost leadership.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
Remember that in Michael Porter's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.600
generic strategy matrix it

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.960
is determined that there were

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960
mainly three.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.580
You can choose to be cost leadership,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.380
you can choose differentiation

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.880
or you can choose to focus

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.760
on a niche or a specific

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.000
segment.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
Let's see what cost leadership is.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.180
It is a fact that many people are confused.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.780
Being a cost leader is not being a price

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.360
leader.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.680
Being a cost leader means being

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.360
within your sector or industry

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.640
that has the possibility

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.360
to produce or provide services

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.340
at a lower cost.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.960
It is a cost leader.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.860
So from there, what you can

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.180
do, if you sell at the same

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.360
price as others, what you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.920
do is get higher profits.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.520
Or you can choose to sell cheaper.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.420
In a market where price

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.780
sensitivity jumps, if you sell

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.760
cheaper, you will barrier the market

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.000
and you will gain market share.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.500
You will steal customers from the competition.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600
In any case, what allows you to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.380
be a cost leader is to be in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440
a position of absolute strength.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.380
You have a lot of weapons to compete with.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.720
You can make very aggressive promotions.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.860
You can sell at the same price as

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.380
your competitors.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.080
But what you do is get, as you get

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.340
higher margins, you decide to make

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.020
a much larger reinvestment in marketing,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.820
invest a lot more in marketing

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.540
than your competitors.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.600
And so you are also growing

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.060
and you are earning share, but

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.500
without having to lower prices.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.220
Well, when it makes sense, another

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.600
key question is, when it makes

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.800
sense to opt for a cost-leading

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.680
strategy is because it's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.540
not always and in all sectors

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.500
equal cash.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.320
In principle, the more comfortable

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.440
a sector is, the more it is a concept

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.700
you should understand because we

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.920
have studied it previously.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.900
The more equal or indifferent

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.160
the proposals of the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.660
different competitors,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320
the more price competition

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.180
is usually in this sector.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.740
Let us take an example of

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.260
a raw material sector, for

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.160
example, where all proposals

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.200
are equal.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.060
The customer chooses only on the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.680
basis of price.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.360
In this environment, it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.000
makes sense to be cost-

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.980
leader.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.300
The cost leader in a highly commodified

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.860
sector would be the market leader

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.960
without a doubt.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.440
Well, the question is how, another

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.880
key question, is how it is carried

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.680
out, how it is executed, what

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.340
decisions you need to make

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.500
to be a cost leader.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.800
Because this is not easy, it is not

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.540
just a matter of deciding on cost leadership.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.420


00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.700
To be a cost leader you need

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.820
to have a real commitment to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.960
reduce costs throughout

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.780
the value chain and systematically.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.880
Let's look at examples of companies

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.780
and how they did it.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.180
This is not a complete list,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.820
but it will illustrate the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.760
different options.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.080
Walmart is often placed as the case

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.200
of cost leader due to the economics

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.180
of scale.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.000
In a sector like food distribution

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.140
and a company like Walmart that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.560
is the largest retailer in the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.140
United States, that huge economy

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.880
of scale its size allows it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.680
to be the leader in cost for

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.160
various reasons, but among

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.500
others for the ability to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500
negotiate it has with suppliers,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.020
for example.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.560
Another option you have if you want

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.200
to be a cost leader is to reduce the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.900
supply of services and therefore reduce

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.160
the investment in the provision

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.440
of those services.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.220
Low cost airlines are a clear

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.620
example of this.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.960
Reduce many of the services

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.620
offered by a premium

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.920
airline or many of the services

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.040
offered by all airlines.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.680


00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.360
What happens is that it has

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.320
been shown that there is a large portion

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.260
of customers, a very large segment,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.060
prefer not to receive those services

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.280
in exchange for a significant

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.340
price savings.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.180
One of the most obvious is the case of Ikea.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.040
IKEA reduces service because

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.180
you have to mount the furniture

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.460
in your home.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.480
This was previously impossible

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.060
at any other furniture seller.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.720
And also imagine the cost savings

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.980
that this generates for IKEA

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.860
in terms of logistics because

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.580
you can move disassembled furniture,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.440
save personnel, etc.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.380
Well, it's a clear example of how

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.160
you reduce services but because

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.100
you're playing a lead in cost and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.180
your customer is willing to do

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.480
so.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.180
McDonald's is another case, in this

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.640
case by standardizing its entire

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.460
proposal.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.460
In the tens of thousands

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.900
of McDonald's there are no

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.200
cookers.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.720
You don't have to hire someone

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.320
who has the experience of

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.440
cooking because the processes are

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.080
so standardized, so key-in-hand

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.520
that you can file anyone

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.920
without any experience.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.640
And the first day is already making

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.100
that not cooking hamburgers.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.200
A company with a clear

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.960
positioning of cost leadership,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.200
although there would be a deeper

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.820
analysis, is Mercadona.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.720
A few years ago, 15 years ago,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720
he started advertising his

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.200
slogan of always low prices.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.200
So Mercadona has made many decisions

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.740
to this and we will

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.720
see several.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.680
For example, what you have decided

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.140
is to integrate backwards

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.480
or establish very close relationships

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.520
with your suppliers,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.640
making them a figure that is called

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.460
interprovidor, which we will analyze

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.520
in detail, which ultimately

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.620
allows you to impact the final

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.460
customer a cost savings.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.580
He decided, for example, that it was

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.980
another clearly focused decision to

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.700
be a cost leader, he decided

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.700
to reduce the range of branded products.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.080
For a category, instead of offering

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.440
10 brands, offer 3.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.240
It is in theory reducing the value

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.620
delivered to customers.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.580
What happens is that, obviously,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.020
if you focus on fewer brands,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.000
reduce the range, you can get

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.400
better prices, etc.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.120
Another decision he made to

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.800
reduce costs was to eliminate

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.420
promotions, to have more

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.380
stable prices.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.500
And that allowed him to reduce, for

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.720
example, the poster, the brochures,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.700
etc.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.560
Well, they are all decisions that

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.180
are oriented to be cost leader.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.060
As I said, this is

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.140
a commitment you have to

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.600
make.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.000
Companies, cost leaders or companies

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.740
that compete with that positioning?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.260
For example, in Spain, the shops

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.740
of Chinese have proliferated, which

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.960
could once be shops of

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.500
all hundred, I don't know.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.040
And how do they get it?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.740
What is the key?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.080
Well, because probably the

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.420
labor costs of employees

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.280
are lower.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.620
And that's why they can be allowed,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.320
among other causes, to be leaders

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.660
in cost and price too.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.040
There are other reasons.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.240
For example, this is a case we are

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.120
probably already studying.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.280
The case of Jovan Talent, who

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.920
told us Felix, how they were the

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.640
low cost sector of temporary

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.600
labor companies.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.960
Well, in this case it is the result

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.300
of an innovation in the business

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.000
model, which instead of providing

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.460
the service through people,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.220
such as CTTs, which have offices,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.100
people, etc., in the case of

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.420
Jovan Talent connect them

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.960
to the supply and demand

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.360
of work through an application.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.340
Therefore, they have innovated in the

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.960
business model and this has allowed

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.500
them to offer, having very very

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.360
very very very very much lower costs

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.220
than their direct competitors, which

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.260
are CTTs.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.740
So, what are the challenges

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.080
that a low-cost

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.860
company faces?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.320


00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.940
I would say they are three mainly.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.680
One is that this type of competitive

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.920
advantage, in principle, many

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.960
of them are easier to copy.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.800
They are easier to copy than to differentiate.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.300
So if you can imitate the competitive

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.540
advantage, well, it stops

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.340
being, right?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:26.820
As we saw.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.140
In addition, and it is something

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.360
that always happens, and it is that in

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.240
this type of markets, and especially

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.040
if you compete in cost lead, your customers

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.640
are very unfaithful, because you

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.820
have in mind that they have chosen

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.980
you for being the cheapest.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.280
You have not been chosen in the same way

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.480
as if you compete in differentiation for

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.780
something that the customer likes, no.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.340
They chose you for being the cheapest.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.760
So, as there's another one that's

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.280
a little cheaper than you,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.380
it's that there's no brand loyalty,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.080
right?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.040
And finally, there is a

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.500
difficulty that some company has

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.720
encountered with it, and is that

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.400
if at some point you want to pivot

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.960
and start selling products

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.620
or services of greater value,

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.440
your positioning cheap, low

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.260
quality, etc., often prevents

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.880
you from growing, right?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.180
This prevents them from choosing

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.320
a differentiation strategy.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.380
These are mainly the challenges.
