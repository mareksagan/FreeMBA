00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.980
Marc, your model has an enormous

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.440
particularity, your business model,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.900
and it combines two business

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.200
models within it, within the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.620
platforms, which is the social

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.840
network, which mainly provides value

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.220
through that network effect generated

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.440
by users and generated by

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.520
the content that those users

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.860
share on the social network, as

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.080
it could be Instagram, which

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.480
are users and photos, but it is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.280
combined with a marketplace

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.260
model, and this is, I think

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.240
that in your sector it is unique,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.440
and I imagine that it has a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.520
series of advantages that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.900
I would like to have...

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Yes, I think that is, as you say,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.440
a very unique model in the fashion

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680
sector, a model that in other

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.780
sectors there are things that

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.740
look like, not equal...

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.760
They have combined social networking with...

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.300
They combined, not social network,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.000
but user-generated content, that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920
is, for example, is the model of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.460
House in the United States,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940
which is a company of a value of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.260
4 billion, 40 million users per

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.540
month, where it has user-generated

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.940
content because users play it,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.660
but are above all professionals,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.600
it is not so much social

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.260
network.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.780
But well, you asked me what are the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.700
advantages, and I would start a little

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.920
with the disadvantage, and that is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.780
also for us is a challenge, and is that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.020
you do not have a line to follow,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.740
that is, there are many models, that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.800
is, I copy this business model from

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.460
a player that is in the United

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.520
States, I will do it in the countries

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.680
in the south of Europe, and I fix,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.760
it is like a mirror, and I will

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.420
do it here, a little molding

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.660
the product to your market.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.320
In our case, you don’t have a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.300
line, that is, you have a world.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.580
Because you have created, it is innovation.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.020
Exactly, and with which you don’t

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.280
have a line to follow, but you’re

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.280
trying to validate it long, and that’

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.860
s every day, validating your

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.520
hypotheses about your goal.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.880
I think the important thing is to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.820
have a goal to see if your changes

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.040
you make in the product, in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.040
the strategy, are aligned with

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.860
that goal.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.000
Because if not, in a model like

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.840
ours, where you don’t have a path

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.480
to follow, it would be totally

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.960
mad that.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.460
We would be piloting every

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.140
day, and we’t get what we want.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.520
Indeed, that is the disadvantage,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.300
because you have opened the way

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.220
and you have no one to look at.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.280
and exact.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.960
The advantage, we are the first,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.580
with which you can do with the market

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.120
if you know how to do it well.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.220
Second advantage, it is a model

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.140
that at first is true, that, especially

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.880
investors, has more risk, because

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100
you can not compare that

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.700
is right and that is wrong.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.620
But when you can prove that you’re

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.000
just doing well, many people

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100
are interested in investing in something

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.120
unique, because it can

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.700
become something bigger.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.160
And finally, the advantage, or one

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.100
of the last, is at the market level.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.980
In the end, I’m not competing with

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.380
other players in the markets, and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.980
I don’t have to go to get a position

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.640
that another had.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.620
In this sense, we are the first

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.940
to open that market, it is also true

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.080
that it costs more because you

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.340
have to explain what the product

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.540
is and people don’t know.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.680
But then the user, you get it and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.340
it’s very complicated for others.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.280
What you’re talking about now is

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.160
not the entire business model

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.620
itself, but it’s a bit of

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.040
the positioning of the value proposal.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.560
Of course, as it is new, it is more

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800
difficult that in a minute you explain

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.840
it to me, because if I never know

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.300
it, it requires more details than

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.960
when it is something I already know

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.420
that I already buy it to another.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.000
This is a proposed

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.500
value.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.920
If we do the business model analysis

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.400
so very quickly, and we are both consultants

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.460
and sure we do it well, if we compare

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.440
it with, that is, you are a mix of

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.340
a social network and a marketplace,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.160
if we compare it so only with a social

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.620
network, I think, in principle,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.520
but you can correct me, that the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.600
advantage is that by incorporating

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.140
it in the marketplace you have been

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.720
able to monetize and earn money much

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.160
earlier than if it was just

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.160
a social network, I understand.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.140
See, each has its business model

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.520
in the sense that it is true

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.120
that we have become a social

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.520
network that we can monetize

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.840
both at the level of advertising,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.520
as is the business model on

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.360
Instagram, Facebook, etc.,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.840
and we add the part of transactionality.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.600
That’s very good because you have

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.880
those two channels and they

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.160
open a lot more that you don’t

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.600
need to enter, but we have those

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.960
two options when a social network

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.680
doesn’t have it.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.740
It is an advantage, yes, because

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.400
the value proposal is good for the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.340
user, we could have a social network

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.900
with purchase but that the product

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.620
itself does not fit with the user.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.340
Yes, now forgetting a little of the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.620
value proposal, but only from the

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.160
point of view of the luxury income,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.540
I think it is an advantage over the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.820
social network and if we compare it

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.600
only with the marketplace, by

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.520
incorporating the social network

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.680
what you get is more engagement,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.080
I understand.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.720
Exactly, in the end we have a marketplace

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.600
as a business, but where users,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.440
and that everyone sees it as

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.700
they see it, because they see

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.440
it as a social network.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.400
And it is true, and that we

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.140
want users to see Tonteo & Button

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.120
as a social network and we

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960
want it to be so, that Tonteo

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.140
& Button remains a social

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.680
network.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.440
Why is?

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.760
Because this brings you virality,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.720
this brings you much more engagement, etc.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.800
That is, it doesn’t mean that the business

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.300
is better or worse than the other.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.200
At the end you have to measure your lifetime

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.720
value, you have to measure your CAC and

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.160
you will see if the numbers come

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.660
out or not.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.120
It might not come out either, even

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.880
if it is Tonteo & Button, imagine that

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.740
users do not buy, it is not useful

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.560
for you.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.280
But well, that’s the idea, try

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.520
to create a viral model with the

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.600
good part of buying and transactivity,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.380
charging.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.340
Music is
