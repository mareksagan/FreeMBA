00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.340
Let us look at the different

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.620
strategies in

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.220
pricing.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.840
I really want you to keep in mind

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.160
that I think it’s impossible to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.320
make a complete classification and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.920
the classifications there don’t

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.900
convince me too much because all

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
concepts are complementary, etc.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.480
But what is important, with what I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.100
want you to stay, is that all of

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.160
the things we’re going to see sound

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000
you, you understand them and that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.600
if someday you see yourself in the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.840
position of having to fix prices,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.480
of having to define the price fixing

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120
strategy, at least they sound you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.980
and you can analyze if they can

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.060
apply in your case or not.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.680
We’ll start with a matrix that we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500
have on screen and that’s a matrix

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.200
that it does intend to be a complete

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.680
classification, but it’s not.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.340
This helps to understand

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.700
how the different strategies

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
are.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.900
We have, in this matrix, what we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.820
determine is in the axis of the X,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.480
in the horizontal axis, the degree

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.340
of competitive advantage and what

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.860
we will classify is between competitors

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.460
or companies that seek more quality,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.180
who seek to differentiate

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.560
by, who seek differentiation

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.740
and those who seek to differentiate

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.440
by cost leadership.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.120
And on the X axis, what we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.180
have on the vertical axis, what

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.160
we have is prices and we will

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.580
come out with higher or lower prices.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.780
Then seeing this matrix what we see

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.280
is that in green we have two strategies

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.720
that are very logical and that you

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.460
should already know because they

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.740
are very aligned with the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.860
generic strategies of Michael Porter

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.680
and it is if we have a high quality

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.120
product with a great competitive

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.500
advantage in differentiation,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.900
what we do is to set

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.200
a high price.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.040
Why is?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.020
Because our customers are willing

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.300
to pay that price and we have

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.360
called it premium, a premium

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.720
pricing strategy and we have

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.380
the opposite case, that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.680
are the competitors

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.920
who are looking for cost leadership,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.540
who have made an effort

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.680
to be more efficient, to

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.200
reduce as much as possible

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900
their cost structure and what

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.460
they do is to always

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.980
put low prices, a low cost

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.260
pricing strategy.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.400
So far it is very simple and very

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.860
logical.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.120
What happens is that we have two

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.340
other strategies we have in and that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.000
are more temporary strategies and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.300
we go to the first that we have

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.100
called penetration.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.580
Penetration strategy is given when

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.960
a company with a certain degree

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.240
of imagining a quality product,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.960
a certain degree of differentiation,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.860
competitive advantage,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.360
etc., what it does is enter a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.460
market with an initial low

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.680
price strategy, we call it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.340
penetration strategy because

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.020
the goal of this strategy is

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.120
to win quickly what

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.760
it will do then is to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.260
raise prices and we could

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.980
put a lot of examples.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.840
Amazon Prime, the share of Amazon

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.520
Prime are between 20 and 30 euros

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.480
per year, is very economical and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.820
Amazon offers many services within

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.960
this share, among them offers

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.640
Amazon Prime Video that is a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.620
platform for movies and series

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.360
in streaming as can be Netflix.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020
What’s clear is that Amazon with

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.680
this pricing strategy is looking to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.300
win customers, is looking to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.600
steal customers from the competition,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.760
and is very likely to eventually

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.260
end up raising them or at least

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.820
monetizing those customers or

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.060
making them profitable in other

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.800
ways.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.860
This is the penetration and we

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.780
have the opposite that is called in English

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.580
skimming.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.400
Skimming is the translation of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400
disassembled although I think

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.680
that in Spanish the concept of disassembled

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.460
is not intuitive for this strategy, we

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.340
could translate it as a strategy

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.980
to initially grind the market that

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680
doesn’t sound very well but is

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.400
more representative and here we

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.500
are referring to it.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.480
We will think of a company that

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.840
launches a product and that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.560
the product is within the product

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.340
life cycle, is in one of its first

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.720
phases, is in the introduction

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.820
phase, in the growth phase you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.900
should know how the life

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.080
cycle works, in those first phases

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.000
what you do is to address early

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.120
adopters, people who demand

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.460
that product and who are willing

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.060
to pay much more and are

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.240
well understood with the example

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.200
of mobile phones in

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.880
the 90s, in the early 90s

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.700
especially or in the late

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.980
80s that were very expensive.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.960


00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.800
It’s a clear skimming strategy,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.560
these companies what allowed them

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.700
to go out to the market with those

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700
high prices is to get a lot of cast

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.720
that allows them to invest

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.780
in and more to invest in

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.000
growth and so on.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.900
Therefore, we have four strategies

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.260
that we draw in this matrix, two

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.840
are more permanent strategies

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.060
that are very related to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.120
the generic strategies such as

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.020
being a premium competitor

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.280
or looking for the low cost and in

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320
addition we have two other strategies

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.720
that are more temporary such

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.980
as penetration, very

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.000
low prices to win a lot of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.660
share or the skimming strategy

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.560
that is temporarily in the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.860
first phases of introduction

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.940
of the product’s life cycle

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.920
to put very high prices that

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.640
allow us to reinforce a little

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.800
treasury.
