00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.400
In this class, I will explain

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.920
the differences in the business

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.620
model of a platform compared to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.340
a linear business and I will

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.180
do so using three criteria.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.040
I have identified three criteria that

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.000
define a platform.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.500
We start.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.800
Well, the first thing I want you

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.160
to know is when we talk about

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.100
a linear business, what

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.120
is the main feature?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.940
Well, as its name implies linear,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.300
the main feature

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880
is that linear create linear

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.660
value from the company

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.380
to its customers.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.680
They sell products, provide

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.860
services, whatever it is, but in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.540
a linear way and any example is worth

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.520
us.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.360
Mercedes creates value to its customers

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.400
by selling cars, Ikea by selling

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.760
furniture, H&M by selling clothes,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.720
a hotel by providing accommodation

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.320
services.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060
It delivers value in a linear way,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.940
but on the platform things change.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.880
In the platform, first criterion, there

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.080
are two sides.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.140
There are two customer segments

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.900
or there are two sides that connect

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.300
within the platform and the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.340
delivery of value is created within

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.480
the platform between the two sides,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.780
between supply and demand,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.780
between users of a social

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.000
network, etc.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.420
Is it worth?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.160
Unlike the linear business where the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.520
company creates value for its customers,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.560
the platform does what it does

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.480
is create an infrastructure within

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.860
which the users of the platform,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.520
both sides, interact with

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300
each other and create value.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.980
Let us see it with an example.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.980
Marriott is a hotel chain.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.980
Marriott provides value, creates value,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.160
forgives, by providing accommodation

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.980
services to its guests, to customers.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.140
The linear model.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.960
Go to Airbnb.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.980
What does Airbnb do?

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.120
Does Airbnb provide accommodation

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.660
services to its customers, guests?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.240
No, what it does is create

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.600
a platform within which there

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.420
are homeowners and guests.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.120
This is the first of the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.200
criteria of a platform with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.560
respect to a linear business.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.320
We have two sides.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.900
Let us go to the second criterion.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.180
The platforms are based on the network

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.200
effect, network effect, or network

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.060
economy.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.960
You will hear it in different ways.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.320
I will explain it again in comparison

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.380
with a linear model.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160
Let us return to the case of Marriott.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.900
Marriott creates value from the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.060
first customer to the last.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880
That is, if Marriott had only one

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.740
customer or any linear model had

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.460
only one customer, it creates value

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.020
to the first customer.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.140
On the platforms, this is not the case.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.460
On platforms, value grows as

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.600
the number of users on both

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680
sides of the platform increases.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.480
This is the network effect.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.180
That is, Airbnb provides value

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.860
in the way it can add a huge

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.480
critical mass of users,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.720
both on the side of the owners

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.800
and on the side of the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.980
guests.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420
If it had no critical mass, if it had

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.840
not enough users, it would not

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.400
create value.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.860
You think that on Airbnb, if you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.960
want to rent a house in Madrid and

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.220
there are only two houses in offer,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.660
it does not bring you any value.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.220
Or if you are a owner in a house and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.820
it turns out there are very

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.400
few guests, because it also does

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.340
not bring you value as a owner

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.900
of the platform.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.920
The network effect is available

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.080
on all platforms.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.500
We can give examples of a dating

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.120
network, for example, Tinder.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.220
Tinder brings more value as

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.620
more users are involved.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.520
Thus, the network effect is the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.140
effect that is given on a platform

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.740
because the value it provides,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.220
which creates the platform for

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.180
all its users, increases as the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.280
number of users increases,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.140
right?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.320
This is a consequence without critical mass,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.800
without many users, without millions

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.080
of users, in a thing that has its

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.220
advantages and its disadvantages.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.720
We will discuss it later, but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.180
I want you to be clear.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.880
And this is very different from

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.460
a linear business, because

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.620
linear business creates value

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.140
from the first customer to the last.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.820
Now, we go to the third criteria.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.720
The resources a platform needs

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.980
are very different from the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.560
resources a linear model needs.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.360
Let us return to the case.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.840
What are the resources a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.100
business model like that of a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.860
hotel chain like Marriott needs?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.180
You probably already know.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.880
The hotels.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140
It needs assets, real estate assets.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.380
Mostly, there are more key features

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.900
we could add, but mostly

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.280
they are hotels.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.380
What is the key resource you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.620
need Airbnb or any other platform?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.920
The platform.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.140
You don't need to own the productive

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.720
media, you need the platform,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.000
which is where supply

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.860
and demand or users

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.880
connect.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.380
But let's see with more examples.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.300
What are the resources

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.540
a taxi company needs?

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.000


00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.620
Cars and licenses.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.880
What resources does Uber

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.420
need?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.660
You can definitely go ahead.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.150
The platform.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.310
As you can see, if we analyze the business

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.470
model and see it very clearly in

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.490
the canvas, the key resources a

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.870
linear business needs with respect

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.990
to a platform are completely

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.350
different, basically because

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.870
on the platform only the platform

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.730
is needed.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.010
In linear models, the key

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.910
resources are the assets associated

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.710
with the provision of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.270
that service or the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.190
sale of that product.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.410
Consequences of this?

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.450
Well, there have been many tweets that

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.830
have been very viral looking at a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.670
bit this fact that is getting so

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.570
curious, that a company like Uber,

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.850
which is the world's leader in people

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.010
transportation, urban transportation,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.950
doesn't have any car.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.890
Airbnb has no home.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.290
YouTube, which is one of

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.350
the world's leading content

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.290
platforms, but the first,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.750
has no autovisual content,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.190
is not the owner of any

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.070
of the videos.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.290
As you can see, a huge revolution

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.030
has occurred in the business

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.210
world thanks to the disruption

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.310
of the platforms.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.830
Well, let's look at it, because it's

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.130
important that you understand the differences

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.130
between a platform and a linear

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.370
model very well.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.150
The platform, to begin with, has two

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.910
sides.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.570
There are two segments within

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.930
the platform that create value

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.470
for each other, unlike a linear

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.870
model in which the company

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.770
delivers linear value to

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.530
the single customer segment.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.650
In addition, a network effect is

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.230
generated on the platform, the

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.570
network effects are generated

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.290
because as the number of users on

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.250
the platform increases,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.550
the value generated by the platform

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.250
for all users increases.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.150
And this has a pernicious

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.410
effect on the fact that without critical

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.170
mass, without a sufficient critical

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.690
mass of users on both sides, the

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.090
platform is unusable,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.390
it is worthless for nothing.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.150
And finally, the key resources

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.830
a platform needs, the business

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.690
model on the platform,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.970
are very different

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.350
from linear.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.850
Why is it?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.510
Because the only thing that is needed,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.370
the main resource is the

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.510
platform, within which the

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.690
two sides are connected,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.470
unlike a linear model in which

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.870
you have to be the owner of

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.570
the productive media.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.710
And we talked, for example,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.470
about Marriott, who has

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.250
to be the owner of hotels,

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.250
or we talked about a taxi

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.310
company that has to

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.610
be the owner of taxis, vehicles

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.930
or licenses.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.130
In the next class, what we're

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.170
going to do is we'll analyze

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.790
the consequences, benefits

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.850
and challenges of platform

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.230
business models over linear

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.030
ones.
