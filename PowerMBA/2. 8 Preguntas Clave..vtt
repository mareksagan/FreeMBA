00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.680
One of the most common problems

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.300
in companies, which happens to you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.480
almost we would say that at 99%,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.460
is the loss of direction, the loss

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.420
of strategic vision, and this happens

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.560
equally in large organizations

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.680
than in SMEs, and it is a real pity

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.160
because really lose height,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.060
not having clear your strategy,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.560
lose the direction, you will

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.380
be away from doing great

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.220
things.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.140
I, as I think many of you have,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.580
have been a consultant for many

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.160
years and have lived with this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.340
and have had to fight this

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.060
permanently as an external

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.400
advisor that what you do is help

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.120
companies of different sizes

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.760
to rise, to the managers to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.640
rise and to see the photo from

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.400
above.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.940
What are the problems in particular?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, because they are mainly two or

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.840
the causes that make us lose direction.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.360


00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.720
One is daily operation.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520
This happens to all of us

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.180
in our workplaces, to all of us.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900
The day to day consumes you because

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.180
you have to do many things in the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.160
day, many things that in many cases

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.100
are urgent, but sometimes they

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.540
are urgent but not important.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.940
So what you are doing is permanently

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.100
shaking, embarrassing, getting

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.080
stuck in the mud of day to day

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.620
and that makes you lose vision

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780
or lose height, makes you not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.160
being putting yourself up for

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.340
the really important

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.080
or strategic things.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.040
And in the end you are there in the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.840
mud and you grow something, you do things

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.920
better or worse, but you won’t do

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.940
big things like that if you don’t

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.880
take your head out.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.580
And the second cause is that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.780
many times companies,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.300
especially when they are younger,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.720
more innovative, etc.,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.360
face many opportunities

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.280
and in some cases it is

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.360
like you drag the current.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.600
Because sometimes you have made decisions

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.440
maybe without putting them out well and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.240
well, because your vision was that and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.540
in the end you are going there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.640
And that is also a huge problem.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.080
Therefore, we do not tire of

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.060
recommending that all possible

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.420
mechanisms be used so that this

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.100
does not happen, so that we are

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.760
not caught in mud and so that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.440
we do not let ourselves be carried

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.720
by the current, so that we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.040
have very clear what our strategy is.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.540
This can be done in different ways,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.260
you can hire external consultants,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.680
which happens that the vast

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.580
majority are very bad.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.260
You can hire advisors who

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.960
will be bringing you an external

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.700
view, this is okay,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.120
this can help you.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.640
But what every leader or manager

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.120
should do is make a permanent

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.320
effort to have a strategic

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.380
vision of their company,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.080
where it is going and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.420
what it is doing.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.940
And that’s why we’ve created a framework

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.900
that is eight questions, which are

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.280
eight key questions, very simple,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.240
that every leader should be able

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.140
to answer always and have them very

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.320
clear and have them very present.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.240
We have categorized these

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.720
questions really into two levels

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.380
because they are two levels.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.020
There are questions that are

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.940
more strategic and the answers will

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.020
not change in the short term, and there

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.220
are questions that are more

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.580
tactical, more operative, and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.540
that will change.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.460
I will explain one by one.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.100
The first is why we exist, what we dedicate

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.340
ourselves to, what is our reason

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.260
for being this, we have seen it in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.620
previous classes, is the mission

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.220
of the company, why we exist.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.420
The second is what we dream, what

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.680
is what you dream, it can not be

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.840
that every day you dream with a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.080
different thing because then you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840
are a velet, you have to have very

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.720
clear what your vision is, what

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.880
is what you want to.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.340
The third question is how we behave.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.360
These are the values.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.260
We need to be very clear about

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.080
what values will guide our

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.480
current and future behavior.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.240
They will guide absolutely everything,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.520
they will be determinants of the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.300
business culture.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.920
What do we believe in?

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.660
We believe in transparency, we

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.000
believe in being very close to customers,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.760
we believe in having happy

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.920
employees, we believe in communication,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.940
we believe in innovation.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.620
We have to have it very clear, companies

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.380
that have very clear their values,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.940
their principles in what is what

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.080
they want and also live in a totally

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.900
consistent manner with those

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.760
values always goes better, it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.820
is proven.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.180
The fourth question is,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.700
well, we have a mission, we

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.460
have a vision, we have values,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.100
but why will we succeed?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.780
So why will we

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.260
it?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.340
You have to be very clear about this.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.080
In some cases, it is your competitive

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.140
advantage, what makes you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.820
different?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.440
What makes you different from

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.040
others?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.880
What makes you different or what makes you different?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.580
It is a broad concept of differentiation,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.400
competitive advantage.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.260
We have seen it in previous

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.800
blocks, but we have to have

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.540
it very clear.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.500
Why is?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.320
Because we are the best in this or

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.040
because our product is better or

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.880
because we have a better

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.100
customer experience.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.400
Or because, well, there will

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.960
be some reason with which you can

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.980
explain very clearly how that vision

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.000
will come, because if you are not

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.100
even able to explain it very

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.800
convincingly, I think it is

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.240
impossible for you to get it.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.140
The fifth question

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.940
is what we offer.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.620
What is our value proposition?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.320
It is not the same as mission.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.280
Your mission can be to help

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.320
people acquire the key

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.460
knowledge to be professional

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.500
success.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.600
But what is it you offer?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.620
It’s a good thing, because it will depend

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.440
on the products and services you

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.480
have at any time.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.000
But you have to have it very clear,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.500
those products and services, those

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.420
value proposals, what problems

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.360
they answer or what needs

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.720
they meet, etc.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.340
You have to be very clear about this.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.460
These are five strategic thinking

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.340
questions that, as I tell you, do not

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.660
change from night to morning.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.360
They are stable.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.500
And now let’s go with the three

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.680
additional questions that are more tactical,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.340
they are more operative and almost

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.880
every week you would have to review them.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.820
And they are three.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.600
The first is, what is most

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.380
important now?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.340
You should almost sit down on

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.920
Monday morning or repeatedly

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.320
with your entire team and say

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.960
what is vital now?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.740
Because what can happen if you don’t,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.460
that’s what happens and makes the

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.640
diagnosis and sure you happen to you,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.480
is that you put yourself into doing

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.220
things.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.080
And what it does is that it is taking

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.100
you the current, because you put yourself

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.240
to do things, but that’s the most

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.200
important thing now.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.940
This is how you create more value for the company.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.780
Probably not.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.860
So I recommend you ask

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.240
it every week.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.420
What is the most important?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.780
What do we have with the resources

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.600
we have?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.960
What should be the most important

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.580
priority in order to create the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.640
most value for the company?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.780
Not to do the things we

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.760
have to do, no.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.400
To create the largest value for the

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.840
company that is usually created by

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.520
creating more value for customers.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.420
Well, that is the first question.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.340
What should be prioritized

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.920
in the short term?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.220
The next is, and what are

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.780
we doing?

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.840
Of our 100% of our time, how much

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.120
are we spending on important

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.900
things?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.900
I guarantee very little.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.520
and sure.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.400
What are you dedicating?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.460
So, do things, as we always

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.420
say, right?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.060
You do things.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.260
But not the important ones.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.800
We need to make this diagnosis.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.560
And the last of the questions is,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.300
well, we already know what is

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.520
the priority, what is the important

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.540
thing, what is what we have to.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.880
We have made the diagnosis that

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.960
in many cases it is not what

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.400
we are doing, but we will do it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.800
We will put concrete plans to

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.180
those goals in the very short

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.520
term, basically to prioritize

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.660
what is important.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.860
What we need to do here is to

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.200
set up concrete plans.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.760
We offer you a simple structure.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.120
There are thousands of structures,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.480
but what we can do is the following.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.420
We will identify what the objectives

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.920
we have analyzed before.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.300
What is priority now?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.600
What is what we have to?

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360
We will identify tasks

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.140
to those goals.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.020
We will set deadlines.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.040
We will assign some responsible.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.800
We will set a budget

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.700
if it is.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.080
And also do not escape.
