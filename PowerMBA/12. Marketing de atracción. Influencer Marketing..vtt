WEBVTT

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.180
Michael, thank you very much for being here.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.460
It will be a pleasure, for many reasons,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.880
among others, because it is a very

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.760
interesting topic.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.700
The theme of influencers, which

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.740
generates people a lot of curiosity,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.700
etc.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.200
First, tell us what the benefits

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.080
of influencer marketing are.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.960
It is a very trending topic,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.220
but also a very complicated

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.700
topic and therefore also needs

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.020
a lot of interest.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.700
The main benefit or goal

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.940
of an influencer marketing campaign

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.120
for me goes into two parts.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.720
One is that you want to access the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.940
influencer audience, considering that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.880
these influencers have emerged

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.140
now with very niche audiences,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.780
which I say niche, but that they

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.640
can be millionaire, but niches

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.260
in themes, say, and you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.620
want to access with your communication,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.140
with your campaign to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.680
that audience.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.820
But the second and that goes hand

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.900
in hand is that it is the prescription

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.300
of influencing your audience, because

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.180
of itself the audience,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.860
obviously, we can impact it, but

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.240
that the fundamental part is that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.640
the prescriber, who is the person

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.740
referring to that audience,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.160
say something in favor of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.600
our brand.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.960
Of course, it is not as if that

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.180
million people are impacted by

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.660
paying, imagine, in different

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.180
ways, but that many times paying

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.700
people are very reckless, advertising

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.540
generates more and more aversion,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.680
but it is that someone is telling

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.500
him that person, that million

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.640
people, follows, believes

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.200
in him or in him, trusts,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.920
etc.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.700
And that is a very niche audience,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.020
too, that can be specified,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.720
we are based on very broad

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.980
audiences, here we have something

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.240
very specific.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.320
This is the third advantage,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.520
which we can segment very

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.940
well.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.340
Perfect, now I would love you tell

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.260
us what types of influencers

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.900
there are, because it will help

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.100
us understand this world a little

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.320
better and also will help

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.880
us understand if we want to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660
do a campaign, a little to value

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.180
where we have to go.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.080
We could classify influencers

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.120
by three parameters, i.e. three

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.100
ways, by type of influencer,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.740
by social networking platform,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.800
mainly, and by type of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.340
content.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.780
As for the type of influencers, we

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.480
can say that there is the famous,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.680
the celebrity influencer, the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
one who is a television presenter,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.840
actor, footballer, who is the most

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.140
conventional, who is well known

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.540
by conventional media

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.500
and who usually have smaller auditions

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.100
on social networks and charge

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.520
a lot, mainly for the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.240
right of image, more than

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.500
for their audience.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.060
Then we have the native influencer,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.440
this person who has arisen

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.100
from the way technology has

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.180
allowed someone to distribute

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.560
their messages and communication

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.480
to large, without having

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.900
owners of a radio station.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.280
Especially through social networks,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.800
because people who have started working,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.460
many children or adolescents

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.080
or older people, have started

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.540
to communicate and have created

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.600
an audience.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.860
These people are beginning to live

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.700
from it today, it depends on the platform,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.920
but yes, they are already professionals

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.620
in terms of influencers and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.100
they have the effectiveness

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.540
of prescription.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.700
And the latter is micro influencers,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.520
they are emerging, they are small

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.600
accounts that are also native

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.720
influencers, but still do not live

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.760
from it, but they have the curiosity

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.920
that they have the highest level

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.880
of prescription in front of their audience.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.400
This is common sense, because if

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.420
you have more prescription

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.080
power over your five best friends,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.600
taking it to the extreme, than

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.380
over your 5,000 friends on

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.660
Facebook, well that 5,000 friends

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.860
are a lot, but if you have

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.940
5,000 friends on Facebook.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.740
The link is much closer, with which

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.840
the prescription level

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.340
is fired, they are the three main

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.800
types and I’m going to say that

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.200
the conventional native influencer,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.080
man, are people who are not so

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.520
known outside the environment

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.100
of their audience, very familiar

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.220
with their audience and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.380
not so known outside that

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.800
environment.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
Effectively, it’s a youtuber

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.680
who has 5 million followers,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.860
but that none of these students

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.380
know him, because he talks

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.540
about topics you don’t have

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.940
to know.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.260
For your audience, you are God.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.360
The second factor to consider

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.380
is the platform, obviously,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.040
because there we have the main

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.020
ones that could be instagram,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.140
facebook, twitter and youtube,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.660
also have implications

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540
about where we want to be.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.660
Instagram is the one that is most used

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.080
at the level of influencer marketing,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.960
because we can work with smaller

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.380
budgets and is populated

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.480
with influencers.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.960
The image theme is a lot worked

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.260
out, obviously there is all the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.920
interaction achieves.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.380
and shared.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.260
After we have youtube, youtube is where

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.880
we have the most well-known influencers,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.940
because as it works in the video they

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.440
have been exposed more as people,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.840
then it is a bit the evolution of the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.140
tele, because it is youtube and

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.660
the most famous, the rubies,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.760
the names we know most, sweet

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.800
of all, because they come

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.240
from there.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.580
It’s a bit more expensive by the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.080
format of producing a video on a photo

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.340
on Instagram, it’s and we

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.180
get the highest return, the best

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.400
ROI, the return on investment

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.220
on youtube.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.280
We have a big budget

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.300
as well.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320
We can do small campaigns,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.320
but where we make big

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.640
budgets with top influencers,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.460
we get the best ROI of

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.900
all social media.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.880
For example, 100,000 people see you.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.880
At the lowest price, right.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.100
Youtube also allows you to explain

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.140
more, if you have a product,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.040
an activation that requires

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.920
a more extensive explanation,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.120
the best is a video on youtube,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.920
explains much more than a photo,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.080
obviously.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.200
Then we have Facebook, which is

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.600
the first social networks, where

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.080
we have a larger audience, we

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.380
do not have many influencers

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.500
who work on Facebook as the

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.480
main account, although influencers

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.660
always have all the social networks,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.140
they have one where their contents

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.120
are centered and Facebook

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.520
is not where we have that, it

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.860
costs us much more to find

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.340
influencers centered on Facebook.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.560
And twitter is the one that gives

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.520
us less ROI, it has all, it is

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.540
the one that has less interaction,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.600
less views and works very well

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.020
for conversation, for a campaign

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.160
we create trend, with a hashtag

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.820
for example, the conversation

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.540
works very well.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.040
And then the third category

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.340
is really the theme.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.520
And the theme, because there where

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.860
the contents of the influencers

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.180
most affect, obviously the

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.420
lifestyle, which englobe fashion,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.860
beauty, then we have gamers,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.700
who are very potent, we have

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.960
training, training also that

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.760
englobe in the broad sense, that

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.080
we have here, like we have kitchen

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.440
recipes, tutorials of manualities,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.480
we have decoration, we have

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.860
science with experiments

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.060
or mathematics, that is

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.080
a coat does not fall into account

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.720
that it is one of the most successful

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.580
formats within social networks,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.960
especially the video.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.440


00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.720
I’m going to make a final summary,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.880
it will help us understand how the

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.440
world of influencer said, it

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.540
will help companies that want

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.880
to have information to start planning

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.340
an action.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.540
First, three types of influencers,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.780
the celebrities that are the famous,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.980
who charge for the brand image that

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.020
they don’t have so many followers

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.820
on social media because

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.000
it’s not their story, they’

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.400
re another thing, since a footballer,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.460
a presenter, whatever

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.320
it is.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.280
We have native influencers who

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.560
have big audiences because

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.840
basically it is what they monetize

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.300
and we have micro influencers,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.680
who are people who have less

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.160
audience but who have more prescription

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.240
power, because they have more

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.320
relationship than influencers,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.280
but in any case all have

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.840
a high prescription power

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.640
over that audience.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.120
On the other hand, we have to keep

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.760
in mind that influencers are present

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.980
on different platforms,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.060
they use one platform mainly,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.840
but then also in some cases

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.500
the posts they do or whatever

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.560
because they also publish

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.000
them in others.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.680
And each platform also has features,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.740
you have to understand them

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.140
well, because for example

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.460
Instagram is the natural platform

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.520
if your category is related to,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.120
if what they sell is related

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.240
to fashion, beauty, etc. And

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.580
it is also the one that grows

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.420
most, the world of influencer

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.200
is growing a lot in

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.380
Instagram, young people,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.060
etc.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.080
YouTube has that roll is very

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.240
high because it is that you

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.620
have influencers with a

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.820
beastly audience.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.260
Scenes of millions.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.160
That’s and also allows you

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.360
to communicate a little more sophisticated

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.500
proposals because clear if my proposal

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.200
is something super innovative and

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.680
it’s not understood, because in

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.920
a photo on Instagram I can’t plug

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.980
a little, try to turn traffic to

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.720
the website, I don’t know, but

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.740
YouTube allows you to tell

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.500
the whole proposal, the video,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.700
the explanation below, etc.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.500
And then you talk about Facebook

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500
that is not a social network so

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.940
used by influencers, but

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.340
that has a giant audience and

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.140
Twitter that has less impact.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.380
Influencers can be

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.620
classified according to the

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.920
theme they are talking

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.480
about.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.320
A gamer is a guy who speaks about

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.540
video games in his videos.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.180
Of course, it’s crucial to fit your

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.580
campaign and your activation with

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.120
that content because if you want

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.780
to get the result of your video with

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.200
that influencer to be the same as

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.920
the rest.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.740
For two reasons because, that is,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.280
your proposal has to be related to

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.740
the content, with the theme of that

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.300
channel because first if not, you

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.340
won’t sell.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.400
If it is that you will go to an audience

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.280
that is not you and also, because

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.280
it is that if, in addition to

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.360
that audience can even get you

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.560
to bother, I don’t know how

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.060
to say it.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.820
Yes, yes, it creates rejection.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.540
There must be alignment.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.900
And as you said, and it’s an interesting

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.380
conclusion, there are a lot of categories.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.780
There are influencers of all kinds, there

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.940
are influencers of all kinds.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.100
Therefore, this should be

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.280
kept in the minds of our students

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.240
in that for almost every company

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.200
there may be an influencer who can...

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.900
Yes, yes, there are all kinds of things,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.440
yes, in all kinds of things.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.580
Also, if you sell fashion themes,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.940
because everyone who is in fashion

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.200
knows that you can turn to influencers,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.720
but it’s that you sell almost

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.340
what you sell, look, because

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.680
there may be some influencer

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.860
that is related to your

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.640
category.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.140
Of course, from athletes,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.580
families, there are all kinds

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.500
of themes that can fit and there is

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.040
that it is a selection and you

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.280
have to look really to find those

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.520
categories that best fit with your

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.800
campaign.
