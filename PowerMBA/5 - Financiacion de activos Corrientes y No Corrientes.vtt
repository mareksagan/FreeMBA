00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.400
In this class, what we should learn

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.480
is how to structure the right side

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.820
of the balance sheet, that is,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.500
the net asset and liabilities,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.860
how to finance ourselves according

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.180
to the assets that a company

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.660
has.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.460
And before I enter the theoretical,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.120
accounting and so on, what

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.240
I'm going to do is, I'm going

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.380
to put a case and we're

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.660
going to start from pure

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.800
common sense, right?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.140
You get a loan of $1 million for

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.540
six months and you get two options.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.640
With that one million euros,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.040
you can build two.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.280
One, buy used cars, only cars,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.220
only pure goods, and sell them,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.640
and you know they are sold

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.600
in a period of two to three

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.400
months, or mount an industrial

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.460
washing machine, a washing

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.280
tunnel.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.240
In both cases, you will invest one

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.600
million euros, in one case to buy

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.520
the cars and in another case for

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.700
the immobilized.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.700
Remember, you have to return

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.700
it after six months.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.320
Which of the two options is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.040
more feasible?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.890
Well, because clearly it is this.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.890
Clearly buying goods that are

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.830
more liquid and that will

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.070
generate treasury in a short

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.950
time will allow you to repay

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.590
the debt at six months.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.310
However, if what we do is invest

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.610
in a fixed asset, a very permanent

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.030
asset and very little liquid,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.350
when six months pass, you will

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.510
not have money to return

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.450
a million euros.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.330
How will you do it?

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.310
Now let's explain it from the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.530
point of view of the balance sheet.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.170
But I am sure you understand it better now.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.450
Non-current assets, such as the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.270
laundry, which are low liquid,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.070
should not be financed by

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.750
short-term loans in principle.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.470
Because at the time that the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.470
loan is over, the asset has

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.550
not yet generated the treasury.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.070
They should be financed

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.610
by permanent funds.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.450
Also keep in mind that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.310
usually non-current assets

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950
the balance remains for

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190
a long time within the company.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.210
Let's think, for example, that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.710
we have a fixed asset balance

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.450
of $500,000.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.090
It's very likely that $500,000

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.070
will remain that fixed balance

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.090
for a long time because

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.530
you need those assets to run.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.750
Therefore, you should finance it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.610
with either contributions from

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.710
the partners or long-term loans,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.850
that is, with permanent capital.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.620
If we go to current assets,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.060
current assets are, for example,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.500
the cars we have bought

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.760
that we will sell in

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.040
a short time.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000
They are quite liquid assets

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.340
that will generate treasury

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.360
in a short time.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.900
We can finance them with current

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.620
liabilities or with short-

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.540
term fingers, as we have

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.080
seen.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.080
You will be able to generate the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.520
treasury and you will be able to repay

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.680
the loan.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.100
Finally, we will compare the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.140
asset structure of two

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.120
very different industries

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.300
or sectors, such as industry

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.340
or large distribution.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.920
Let's think about the business of a supermarket.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.620
The necessary investment

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.860
asset structure of the industry

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.000
has a strong weight, as we

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.060
see here, as far as non-current

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.500
assets, to immovated,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.980
fixed assets, which is all

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.240
the machinery you need to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.160
manufacture.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.820
This requires a financial structure

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.240
with a lot of permanent

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.220
resources.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.920
You have to have huge contributions

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.000
of social capital or

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.200
long-term debt.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.660
However, in the case of the supermarket,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.800
as we see, the structure of

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.920
the liability is very different,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.180
because the weight of the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.140
current asset is very high

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.760
over the total investment.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.300
Let's think that really

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.860
much of the investment

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.360
is stocks or are the goods

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.700
you buy to resell.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.560
This allows you to be more

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.580
flexible and to be able

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.700
to fund yourself more with

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.860
more short-term resources,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.100
even by helping you pay

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.960
suppliers.
