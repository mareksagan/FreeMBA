00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.220
Before we analyze Tesla and see

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.800
what we can learn from Tesla,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.380
I want you to keep in mind that the

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.160
Tesla Group is not really just

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.040
an electric car manufacturer.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.860
Tesla is a company that revolves

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.640
around renewable energy,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.560
makes electric cars, makes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.360
solar panels and makes batteries

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.460
and there are certain synergies

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.000
between all the lines that is

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.580
the founder and CEO of

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.220
Tesla, who is a leader, a visionary,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.040
and that what he wants is not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.380
to manufacture electric cars,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.940
what he wants is to change

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.560
the world, what he wants is

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.400
to gradually abandon the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.680
use of fossil energy, what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.920
he wants is to slow

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.060
global warming,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.880
etc.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.480
And so that you get an idea of how

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.460
Elon Musk is, how he is dreamer,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.760
well, because he is the founder

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.560
of SpaceX, which is a company

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.160
that makes rockets and has the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.060
idea of sending humans to Mars

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.800
and at some point creating a colony

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.920
there, etc.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.800
We'll start talking about Tesla

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.260
in the electric car industry.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.040
The first thing I want you to take

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.800
into account is that unlike other

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.020
companies we analyze, of which we

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.800
say they are changing the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.140
world, Facebook for example, we

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.180
can think of Airbnb, Airbnb revolutionizes

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.300
a global sector, but with a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.300
very different business model,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.540
because it is a marketplace, or Uber

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.040
with respect to taxis for example,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.340
but in the case of Tesla is not so,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.240
we must take into account that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.200
Tesla what it does is to enter into

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.860
competition in a very mature

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.680
market, with huge barriers

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.600
of entry, with very large players,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.180
such as the large automobile

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240
groups, but with a more similar

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.100
business model, with certain

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.700
innovations but in the end competes

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.300
frontally.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.940
The first doubt that generates us

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.740
is Tesla, it is a well-known brand,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.760
it is a brand with

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.400
a very good positioning, it is a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.620
brand with very good prospects, but

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.180
today what dimension has Tesla?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.640
Within the car market, what

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.660
is its size?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.120
We can analyze this from different

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.220
perspectives.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.940
If we analyze it from the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.640
perspective of the number of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.860
cars sold, income, number of

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.120
employees or market share,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.400
then Tesla is very small.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.980
I will share this table with

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.920
you, here we have related different

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.940
variables, we have the first of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.040
the columns, what we have done is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.940
to order the big ones according

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.600
to their stock market capitalization,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.520
the value of the company, as

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.380
we see Tesla is the fourth,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.720
Tesla is one of the big ones.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.560
However, this seems to be a bit

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.940
inconsistent with the current

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640
results of Tesla's business, because

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.520
if we look at the market share

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.180
that Tesla has, for example, because

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.340
it is infinitely lower than its direct

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.860
competitors, even look at

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.420
Tesla has a market share of 0.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.540
37% and BMW, Ford or General

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.280
Motors because around 10 each, or

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.620
in sold cars, is that Tesla sold

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.600
76.000 cars in 2016, it is very

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.280
little compared to the millions

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040
that sell their competitors, however

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.920
as we have seen it is

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.780
a very valued company, the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.940
fourth largest in the world

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.240
and here comes out a very

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.440
curious ratio that is because

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.260
the car sold in 2016 Tesla is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.300
worth 800,000 dollars, look at

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.620
and General Motors is worth

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.320
5,000 dollars, why is it so?,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.360
because this is a question that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.340
we have answered, why the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.580
investors confided in Tesla?,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.440
Why Tesla has that value?

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.210
Well, we will analyze

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.110
it from the perspective

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.950
of growth, we talk about

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.370
a mature market with

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.890
annual growths that in

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.090
the coming years we will

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.230
put that it is of 5% or something

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.970
like that worldwide,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.290
to say something, and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.810
all players within this

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.490
mature market, those we

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.430
have seen as Toyota or

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.390
Volkswagen etc., because

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.830
they will grow more or less

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.750
at that rate, but it is

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.230
that the reality is that

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.550
Tesla grows a lot more

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.750
than the others, despite

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.590
that part of a very low

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.690
market share, but it

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.570
grows a lot more and we

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.810
see it for example in

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.150
this graph, in units sold

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.170
during 2016 Tesla grew

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.450
a 50% and is projecting

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.070
growth rhythms so, if

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.810
you grow much more than

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.170
the others you will

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.370
put fast that car,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.830
and I think that another

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.350
analysis we have

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.910
to keep in mind that

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.470
reinforces the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.830
fact that Tesla is

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.530
valued as is valued

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.550
with those huge expectations,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.430
because they

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.370
are expectations,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.430


00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.230
Well, and what will happen

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.530
in the coming years?

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.090
In the medium term, what

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.750
will be the market share

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.670
of electric cars in

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.370
10 years or 15 years?

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.130


00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.410
Well, because I think almost everyone

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.290
would venture to say it will grow

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.970
by 1.7%, because I don't know, it

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.190
will grow to be a majority.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.150
We would all agree

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.850
on this.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.290
Well, Tesla within the electric

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.530
car is the one that is best positioned,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.870
the one that has the best technology,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.310
is generating real economies

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.210
of scale and competitive

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.990
advantages by selling,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.910
who is going to surfe

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.890
that wave?

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.670
Who is going to grow the most

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.530
within that bestial growth that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.670
will have the electric car in

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.490
the coming years?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.110
Probably Tesla.
