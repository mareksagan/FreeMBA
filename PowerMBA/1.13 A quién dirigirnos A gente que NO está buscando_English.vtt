00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.840
In deciding which segments to

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.140
go to, we will introduce another

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.280
variable, another concept that

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.500
doesn’t always apply, but that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.560
if you can do it, the truth

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.080
is that it has incredible

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.220
benefits for many things that

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.100
we’ll now see, because

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.280
you’ll expand the size of the

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.500
market, etc.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.780
You will create opportunities.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.540
Let us explain it like this.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.800
Let’s think about this cheese, there are

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.940
100% of the people who are your

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.680
target audience.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.280
Basically it is the 100% of the people

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.440
that your proposal can help and

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.140
within that 100% it results

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.580
that around the 20% is a minority,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.260
it is the people who are already

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.480
aware that you or a competitor

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.500
or the proposal can help you

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.820
and are already in the market

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.580
looking, are already

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.600
valuing alternatives, know

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.920
options, etc, etc, etc,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.360
etc, is it?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.900
That is 20%.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.100
And the remaining 80% are people whom

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.520
your proposal might be good for,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.320
but who are not looking for, are not

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.940
looking for yet.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.400
And here we could segment because

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.540
here within these could be people

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.480
who either are aware that they have

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.100
the problem but have not been

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.880
put to look for or people

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.860
directly is that they are still

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.840
not even aware.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
And this applies, I would tell you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.560
that in almost every sector, Power

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.180
MBA, Power Digital Marketing, well,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.580
because there is a very small market

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640
percentage of the target market

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.800
that is already looking for a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.240
master, but very small.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.920
And the great opportunity is among

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.480
the people that he wasn’t looking

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.080
for, but to whom the program,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.920
the master, is good.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.580
If you think of a watch, it is the same.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.420
This watch of C21, from our friends

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.460
of C21, good, because there will

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.000
be a percentage of their customers

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.340
who are already looking for a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.440
watch and know several brands and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.300
are crawling, but the great

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.460
opportunity is that you impact

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.560
online, you know them there, you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.200
will want more chul and shopping.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.860
Apply to anyone.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800
We talked about the digital marketing advisor,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.480
well, because you create a digital marketing

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.780
service, for example, and there will

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.980
be people who are already looking for it.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.820
But it’s the millions of companies

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.080
that are not looking yet.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.580
Now let’s compare the two

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.520
segments.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.200
What you have to be clear is that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600
among the people who are looking

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.320
for it already, you are aware

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.920
that you have the need, know

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.360
the different options, prices,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340
etc., you have a percentage

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.340
of closing the operation of,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.720
for example, 20%.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.100
by down.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.560
Down because you are late.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.620
What they will do is compare

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.440
you to others.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520
Man, if you have a brutal competitive

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.740
advantage, if you are the only

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.040
one in the market of Power MBA, of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.220
Power Digital Marketing, you have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.160
a very different proposal.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440
So, well, because you get there

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.760
and you can win and you have many

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.360
options to win.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.080
But if you are competing with similar

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.580
proposals, you are one more, with

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.060
some differentiation, but basically

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.240
one more, you have a low percentage

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.700
of closing that, a

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.060
20%.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.260
The market is small,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.380
20 percent.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.680
However, and this is the powerful thing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.260
to understand here, among the people

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.740
who are not looking for it, it is true

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.000
that it is more challenging because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you have to generate the need, etc., etc.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.740
It is more complicated, the process is longer.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.120
But your chances of closing

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.380
it when someone has shown

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.320
you have helped, are

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.560
much greater.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.280
That’s 80% because you’re

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.640
in that position.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.280
And to finish, what I’m going to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.760
do is put an example that I’ve lived

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220
it and that’s proof that this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.180
works like that.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.840
I was a strategic consultant

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.120
for a few years in Advanced

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.280
Network Consulting, now it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.540
is Advanced Consulting, working

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.420
with Víctor Costa, a boutique

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.040
strategic consultancy,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.900
with very sophisticated projects,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.220
high added value, high

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.600
price, etc., we sold to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.120
mainly large companies.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.400
Of the offers we made,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.200
we closed almost all.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.200
I’ll put you at the 80% I said

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.040
before, right?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380
And that’s something that surprised

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.860
everyone, because usually

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.160
in the consultancy it doesn’t work

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.840
that way.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.740
And what was the reason for this?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.840
The reason for this is that, in

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.520
this case, the merit of Víctor

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.480
Costa, founder and CEO, is that

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.260
we were in this gray segment,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.500
we were addressing customers

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.880
who at that time were not looking,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.220
because they were not

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.700
even aware of those problems

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.900
they had, of those needs,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.660
etc., etc.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.080
We showed it, we had a lot

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.520
of experience with other customers,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.580
etc., well, we basically Víctor

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.640
showed it, then we positioned

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.220
ourselves as someone

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220
who could help them, but they

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.840
were not looking for it and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.540
that's why we closed almost all

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.320
the offers.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.920
It is very difficult to do this.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.400
You have to do what you need,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.420
etc., etc., and we will learn

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.640
how to do it online, which

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.340
is done with a lead magnet, etc.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.160
You have to generate that interest.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.100
I want you to stay with this.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.620
When you are able to target that

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.460
market you are not looking

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.380
for, you begin by enlarging

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.760
the size of the market and then

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.800
become a reference within

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.000
that potential customer you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.300
are not looking for.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.640
Instead, when you address the people

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.740
you are already looking for, that’s

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.640
what everyone does, because if you’

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.040
re one more in the queue and unless

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.240
you have a brutal competitive advantage,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.000
you’ll close a low percentage

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.420
of all opportunities.
