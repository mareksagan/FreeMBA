WEBVTT

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.650
We already know what are the metrics

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.250
or conversion ratios we have

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.890
to optimize, we have it on the

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.130
dashboard, but the next thing

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.530
is, what is what we will do

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.850
to optimize them?, what is

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.070
the plan?, what are

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.130
the tools?, what are the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.270
keys we have to touch?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.150
Well, here I want to make clear one

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.690
thing, as when we talked

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.290
about attraction strategies,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.370
traffic, at the end there is

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.690
a series of channels, a series

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.070
of platforms that we all resort

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.690
to or at least we all know,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.050
which are X, put that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.710
10.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.050
Well, in the case of conversions

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.830
we are talking about

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.230
a much wider spectrum,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.510
things we can do, keys

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.770
we can touch, etc.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.110
Therefore, it takes a lot more intelligence

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350
to optimize conversions than

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.090
to attract traffic than it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.490
does many times, which in many

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.590
cases is just a matter of almost

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.570
money.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.070
Why do we need more intelligence?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.250
Because conversions depend on a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.630
lot of things, they depend on the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.830
message you choose at every

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.030
moment, they depend on what your

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.550
customer is thinking, they depend

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.770
on having enough psychology,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.250
they depend on the number and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.790
the time you impact your customers,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.790
etc.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.610
But what is clear is that if you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.690
get it, the profits that are generated

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.710
are huge, because you almost generate

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.030
a competitive advantage,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.110
because all companies can invest

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050
in attracting traffic, but as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.370
I said it is much more challenging

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.070
to be the best converting.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.850
Well, what we have to do

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.290
is know what the main

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.650
tools and leverage

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.410
are used to increase

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.750
conversions.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.650
And the first thing I want to make

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.790
clear, which is something that is not

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.910
usually highlighted at this point,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.550
is that the most important thing, regardless

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.790
of whether you do retargeting, use

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.210
one or another platform, do lead

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.430
nurturing, etc., regardless

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.470
of the concrete tools, the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.810
most important thing is that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.230
you are good in transmitting

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.450
your value proposal, your

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.290
messages, etc., to your customers.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.530


00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.970
What is it concrete?

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.350
That they understand quickly how

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.370
you can help them, why they have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.530
to buy you, why you, that you help

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.710
them validate that they have a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.810
problem if they don't buy you, etc.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.710
This is what we learned in the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.010
course we were based on Story Brand.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.950
And remember the recommendation,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.090
all communications aimed at capturing,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.750
converting your customers, etc.,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.910
all touch points, messages have

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.110
to be filtered before by this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.150
script, by this structure

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.030
that makes sense to your

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.750
messages.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.390
Well, let's go to the more

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.450
concrete tools and we'll do it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.510
thinking of the two types of funnels,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.150
in the shortest funnel we have, remember

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.530
the macro conversion is to go

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.290
from visits to customers or

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.350
to sales and then we'll do it

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.390
with the a little longer

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.710
funnel in which there are two

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.310
macro conversions, leads and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.990
sales.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.990
We start with the first and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.770
return to the example of Morrison,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.550
the shoe brand.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.110
What is the macro conversion here?

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.430
The percentage of all people who

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.790
visit our website that end

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.650
up buying.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.270
That is what we have to obsess

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.830
ourselves with optimizing.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.690
Now we have to think, right?

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.630
And how do we do it?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.850
What should we focus on?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.410
First, we have to focus on

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.130
the web page, which is the store,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.630
which is where we sell, that is

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.890
where the visits land and we really

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.890
play it in a short time, we play

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.310
it in that the usability is spectacular,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.510
we play it in the photos,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.930
that it is attractive, that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.610
the payment method generates

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.270
confidence, etc.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.990
Why do I say and emphasize that we

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.330
play it in a short time?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.730
Because we are talking about a

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.250
low-impact purchase, it is little

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.790
money, it is easy to decide, you

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.530
are not playing the life being exaggerated

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.930
and in addition it is that

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.730
there is a lot of offer, that is,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.110
over a month at the end you land

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.690
in many different e-commerce

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.530
and you can buy or not buy, but

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.530
your life will not change, so

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.270
the immediate is where it is being

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.520
played, on the website and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.900
so we will see in a later class,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.620
we will see what are the techniques

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.480
to optimize conversions

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.120
within the website.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.440
What I want you to take into account

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.480
is that we actually play

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.480
it there but also we have the possibility

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.160
of buying us or not buying us

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.940
to continue being in the mind

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.280
of our target audience and we

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.180
can do it in different ways,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.240
but you should know for example

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.380
the retargeting, that we will

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.640
do a class in detail, this

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.360
is, imagine that you enter an

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.260
e-commerce and you have not

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.940
bought but you have come to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.540
a certain product and then go

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.840
to a digital newspaper and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.360
you appear in display ads of that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.900
product, as you see that e-commerce

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.120
what you are trying to

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.640
become is a conversion tool

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.520
or social networks too, social

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.600
networks are a tool that

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.880
serve us for many things

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.760
but between them to convert,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.440
why all the brands want

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.140
you to follow in social

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.800
networks?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.600
Because they can be impacting

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.480
you permanently, if we follow

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.780
Morrison, the case we are analyzing

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.720
on Instagram or Facebook, well

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.200
because we will see when

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.620
they take out new shoe

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.580
models and this is

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.820
a conversion tool.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.800
Now we go to a longer funnel, we

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.740
go to the typical funnel in which

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.240
we have two main macro conversion

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.360
ratios that is the percentage

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.680
of leads on visits and subsequently

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.840
the percentage of customers on

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.820
leads and we will see how we can

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.660
manage or optimize the first

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.300
of the ratios, how can we

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.580
capture more leads?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.360
Well, we have a number of tools

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.660
to do so, we have to play with

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.020
the forms on the website for

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.300
example, how do you request

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.140
the data?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.040
You have to be good asking for the

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.160
data, it has to be a form that you

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.160
want to fill in, we can play

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.980
inside the web page with the

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.200
call to actions buttons,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.880
how do we ask for the

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.780
information to be visible, etc.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.200
With what messages?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.480
We can create, for example, a

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.920
landing page or several landing pages

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.620
that are absolutely oriented to capture

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.100
the lead because they have little

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.560
information, little focus because

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.240
with a message, a video,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.780
a benefit, etc. and the

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.320
form or call to action.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.440
We can, very often, offer for example

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.820
a newsletter, we create value

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.840
content that has to interest our

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.860
target audience and what

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.260
we do is if you leave us the

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.060
data we inform you every month

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.280
of something, we deliver value,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.360
it is a strategy of capture of

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.680
leads, we can use the strategy

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.440
that is called lead magnet,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.820
which is a magnet of leads,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.940
and this in what consists?

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.300
Well, imagine that we created a

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.780
free ebook, for example, very attractive

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.480
with the 10 keys or the 10

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.540
recipes, the 10 best cooking

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.600
recipes, etc.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.020
Well, if you are selling something

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.440
related to the kitchen and you generate

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.020
very attractive content and you

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.140
viralize it very much,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.680
you will get a lot of leads that

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.320
you will then have to convert.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.540
Another strategy to generate

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.660
leads, webinars, is a bit like,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.920
after all, it is to deliver

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.440
value, in this case if you want

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.220
to point to the webinar in which

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.220
we will tell you how to do,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.000
etc., etc., well, because you

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.380
have to leave your data or

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.700
for example offering a free

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.020
trial, a free trial, etc.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.440
There are many different ways but

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.940
we have to be very good thinking

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.440
what is what our customer

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.980
wants to offer and in exchange

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.420
will give us their data.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.540
When you give us your data,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.580
what is enabling us is a relationship

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.880
with it.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.900
And here we go to the next phase,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.220
what we have to do is manage

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.380
that lead, we have to inform,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.460
convince, be present in

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.600
the school, has given us

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.540
the opportunity but still

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.780
in many cases is not ready

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.440
to buy.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.880
This is a broad concept that can

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.300
be called nurture, which is to

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.460
feed the lead.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.900
Basically what we have to

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.760
do is through different strategies

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.740
to inform the customer,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.920
sending the right messages,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.880
approaching him, etc.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.880
How can we do it?

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.820
We can do this by retargeting,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.560
which we have seen before, through

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.600
social media but mainly through

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.860
what is called lead nurturing,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.400
which we will

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.140
see.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.220
That to understand it is

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.420
to send a series of mainly

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.180
automated messages in the

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.200
time you are convincing

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.920
or reporting or delivering

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.240
value.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.840
We can send emails with the

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.040
details of our product, we

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.780
can send emails with testimonials

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.240
from other customers, etc.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.040
Another strategy to convert

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.380
or manage leads is telemarketing,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.820
which is called tracking.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.100
Well, in this phase what we have

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.060
done is to manage that lead but what

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.120
we have to do is to close it, it is

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.860
to convince and this will depend

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.920
on the type of business.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.920
In some cases, we will close the

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.960
website if it is an e-commerce

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.080
or in some cases we will

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.200
close through the sales department,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.040
through representatives,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.240
key account managers, etc.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.760
or we will close through

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.320
telemarketing, such as insurance

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.400
companies or telephone

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.240
operators, etc.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.700
As we have seen, there are three stages.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.460
In the first we have to be very

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.620
good capturing leads to optimize

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.320
that ratio, the more leads the

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.020
better.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.700
Then we have to be very good at

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.080
managing designing a series of interactions,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.840
the more automated the

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.940
better to manage the relationship

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.760
with our leads, to help them,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.100
to convince them and finally

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.400
what we have to do is close

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.540
and close different

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.980
ways as we have seen.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.300
On the web page we play

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.680
it back on the usability of the

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.540
web, on the payments pass,

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.100
etc. or in a more traditional

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.940
system of sale, sale through

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.480
commercials or telemarketing.
