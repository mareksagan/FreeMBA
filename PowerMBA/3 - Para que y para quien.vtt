Power Launch Formula will require some effort in terms of time and money, the minimum,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
but you have to make some effort, therefore, from the beginning I want you to know what it is going to serve you, what are the benefits.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
We start with the broadest definition, it is a formula, it really is a very practical guide,

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
that helps you launch innovative products and services with success, it is not a matter of launching, but it is a matter of taking them to success.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
And also minimizing risks.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
We start with the goal, the goal is to reach Product Market Fit, we have said that it was to launch them successfully,

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
and success is the criterion, the moment you reach Product Market Fit, you will have a very solid base to build a great company.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
I want you to know that there are really few innovative projects that reach it, almost all of them are left on the way,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
because they do not know how to do it, and the consequence is that they either die or become mediocre companies,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
like all the others, that do not take off, that do not scale.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
But anyway, I want you to redefine your goal, the goal is to achieve your dream, modify it.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
If what you want is to be a successful entrepreneur, a successful businessman, if you want to be successful,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
if you want to do something beautiful, dedicate yourself to something you like, if you want your current company to reach the next level,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't know, set your goal.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Why? Because I guarantee you that you will be trained, you will have the knowledge and the method to achieve it.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And this is very important, we are going to do it with the least investment and with the least risk possible.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
We are very aware that 90% of projects fail, so what we are going to do, what we have designed is a formula that allows us to take risks

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
as we validate the hypotheses progressively.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
So, the moment you have, for example, to create the first version of your product, which will require some investment,

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
at that moment we will have validated the main hypotheses, we will be very sure that we have something that is solid,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
we have something that makes sense.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
By the way, we can apply all this if we launch new projects, with ideas that you have now, with ideas that arise,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
maybe you are a businessman and you want to evolve, or we will also apply it with your current projects or companies.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Many of you are entrepreneurs, you already have projects in progress, but they have not reached Product Market Fit.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We are going to incorporate this, we are going to prevent you from making the usual mistakes of continuing to push that model

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
and that you continue to look for, evolving the value proposition until you reach Product Market Fit.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
The problem, as we have said many times, is that this is very difficult, and also the proof of this is that almost everyone makes the same mistakes.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
And why? For many reasons. One of them is because Lean Startup is too theoretical.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Lean Startup is spectacular. I remember an article in Harvard Business Review that said something like that,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Lean Startup changed everything, and I really believe it.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
What happens is that there are millions of people who know Lean Startup, understand the concepts, but then they are not able to apply them.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Why? Because Lean Startup is too theoretical. And because you have to break too many mental barriers.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
So what we have done is to turn that philosophy into a practical guide.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
And why? Because as it is very practical, as it is a step-by-step method, it is like forcing us to make good decisions.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
It prevents us from being dragged by traditional thinking and that we make the mistakes that ultimately lead to failure.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I also want you to know that Power Launch Formula is not a practical guide for Lean Startup.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
What we have done is incorporate a series of tools that we consider to be key to determining the success or failure,

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
that help a lot and that people do not do. They do not use them.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
For example, you are going to work on the Customer Persona, you are going to work very well on the script of all the messages that you are going to use in all your communications.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
You are going to work on a dashboard with the main metrics of your business model.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
We want you to be the best in the world launching successful models.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
And I'm going to end with a reflection. It is something that we usually say and it is that the key, the competitive advantage, what puts you to another level is knowledge, is the method.

04:06.000 --> 04:18.000
And instead there are people, when we see, I don't know, talks with entrepreneurs, who talk about what are the keys and say things like, I don't know, passion, optimism, perseverance and things like that.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I think that's nonsense. That is necessary but not enough.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
Because only with that, with hard work, with passion and things like that, what you are going to do is fail like everyone else in 90% of cases.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
And I think that is not what we want. What we have to do is acquire the knowledge, know the method and apply it to the dashboard.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
And besides that, it will accompany us for life because opportunities will arise throughout your life.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Another benefit is that you are going to gain a lot of confidence. You are going to gain a lot of security.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
I really like basketball and I'm going to make a comparison. Imagine how Michael Jordan had to feel when he played in the 90s and when he was the best.

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, we want you to have that confidence. We want you to feel the best once you acquire that knowledge, you feel fully trained.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
And I'm going to compare it with our personal case. We are on our way to achieving one of the greatest success cases in the startup world in Spain.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Our life has already changed and our life will change a lot more in the coming years. I will not go into details.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
But I guarantee you one thing, we are super calm. And why are we so calm? Because we feel like Michael Jordan.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
We feel confident. Because we are smarter than the others? No. It is not because of that. It is because we have acquired the knowledge.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
It is because we apply the methods to the dashboard. And that gives us the security that we are going to make good decisions.
