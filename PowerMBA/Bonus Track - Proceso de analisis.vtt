00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Javier, I would like you to tell us what the analysis process is like to contextualize it.

00:10.200 --> 00:18.680
A startup wants to access financing, contacts investors and I would like to know how it is

00:18.680 --> 00:21.440
from the other side, that is, not from the perspective of the startup, which seems to be

00:21.440 --> 00:24.360
what we have told several times, but from the perspective of the investor, what is this

00:24.360 --> 00:29.000
analysis process and how is the relationship with the startup?

00:29.000 --> 00:36.080
I think that entrepreneurs often have a wrong vision of why investors do things.

00:36.080 --> 00:41.640
I would like us to have that extreme vision of why investors sometimes make decisions,

00:41.640 --> 00:45.400
what they look at, what worries them, sometimes even how the dynamics are, if we are talking

00:45.400 --> 00:48.920
about a fund, within the fund itself.

00:48.920 --> 00:54.600
The first thing to understand is that each investor has some investment criteria and this, although

00:54.600 --> 00:59.920
it seems super obvious, means that your company may be a pass and that an investor rejects it.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.880
And that does not mean that your company is not good and sometimes this, for the entrepreneur's ego,

01:04.880 --> 01:10.400
when he rejects you 4, you say, damn, maybe I'm wrong and I'm setting up badly.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.920
Well, it may be because it does not fit the criteria, because the investor does not have money.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.360
One of the things that must be understood is that investors have our liquidity cycles

01:19.360 --> 01:24.040
and then, if we are talking about a business angel, for example, he has been investing

01:24.040 --> 01:28.480
for 5 years and has invested a lot, but right now he does not have liquidity.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.760
As the exits of his participants come out, he will start to have liquidity.

01:32.760 --> 01:40.200
Yes, there are many people who think that business angels have a money printing machine.

01:40.200 --> 01:46.640
If someone has it, let us know that we will be delighted to invest.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.520
That on the one hand, but then also, for example, the funds have their times.

01:50.520 --> 01:55.440
That is, one thing that almost no one on the entrepreneur's side understands is that a fund is not an element

01:55.440 --> 01:59.400
where there is money and they invest as they see fit, but normally the funds have

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
investment policies.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.720
The investment policy, for example, comes that I invest in a 5 plus 5 fund.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.400
That means that during the first 5 years I do look for new investments and the other

02:07.400 --> 02:11.160
5 years I simply dedicate myself to accompany the initial investments that I have made.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.960
So, if you come to see me in the year 4 and a half, it is that it is very difficult for me to

02:15.960 --> 02:16.960
make investment decisions.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.920
So, the first thing, and it is something that we entrepreneurs forget, is that we have

02:20.920 --> 02:25.720
to ask the investor when he is, how much he usually invests on average per operation,

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
whether he accompanies or not.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.080
And just like an investor does a due diligence, which now we get a little into that, you as

02:32.080 --> 02:37.160
a founder have to do a due diligence and ask, hey, this investor is good, bad, etc.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.920
So, typically, hey, great, we have contacted the investor and he asks us for more information.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.320
Typically, the first information he is going to ask us is going to be the famous pitch deck,

02:47.320 --> 02:50.680
the presentation between investors, which there are a thousand million articles that explain

02:50.680 --> 02:51.680
how to do it.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
I think that does not have a huge...

02:52.680 --> 02:55.120
Well, in the Power MBA we explain it in detail.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.480
Well, great, that's super valuable.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.680
We share examples, etc.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.680
Well, very valuable.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.520
But that presentation, in the end, is used first to see that there is a fit with the criteria

03:03.520 --> 03:08.400
and then it also serves to assess that we are talking about the correct magnitudes, because

03:08.400 --> 03:13.520
sometimes it is not only about whether there is a fit or not, but maybe the size of the

03:13.520 --> 03:17.720
minimum ticket you are asking for is too large or too small.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.960
And this, unfortunately, lately happens that sometimes it is too little what you are asking for.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.200
And this is a bit paradigmatic sometimes.

03:24.200 --> 03:29.400
So, with that presentation, a series of additional data is usually asked, hey, what box do you

03:29.400 --> 03:35.960
have, what is the billing, etc., which are very numerical data that the investor uses

03:35.960 --> 03:38.600
to match them against his investment thesis.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.840
There is one thing that sometimes we forget is that investors have their own investment

03:41.840 --> 03:47.160
thesis and it is, hey, I invest as a maximum in this number of companies, in these characteristics,

03:47.160 --> 03:49.840
with this billing level, with this team composition.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.920
So, there is a first step that is almost logical to say, hey, this fits or does not fit

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
in my criteria.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
It's like a filter, right?

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
It's a first filter.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.160
It's a checkpoint, I invest in projects B2C, in this phase, etc.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.720
And they pass through here and some, like a fan, some stay out.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.720
Literally.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.440
So, the first thing you do is ask for the necessary information to see if you go through

04:10.440 --> 04:11.440
that filter or not.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
Correct.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.720
What the entrepreneur can do at that moment is to do the work proactively and see if

04:15.720 --> 04:20.040
the investor's page is read, which is one thing, I was surprised by the number of entrepreneurs

04:20.040 --> 04:22.160
who do not read who they are asking for money.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.560
This is a relevant issue.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.520
So, read first so that they don't waste your time.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.320
It is no longer that you waste the time of the investor, no, that in the end it is his job

04:31.320 --> 04:34.920
and it is the one that you do not lose and that you hit with the shot.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.400
So, hey, great, it fits reasonably well in the criteria.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.040
Now what we are going to look at is the five T's, okay?

04:42.040 --> 04:47.800
That is, in another video we have talked about the different criteria that an investor has

04:47.800 --> 04:50.640
to decide whether a company is interesting or not.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.800
And here we talk about the size of the market, the attraction, the technology, etc.

04:55.800 --> 04:56.800
What does that imply?

04:56.800 --> 05:00.240
That implies that they are not only going to ask you for that information, but if the investor

05:00.240 --> 05:07.360
is medium-sized, he is going to do a job of analysis and attempt to search and contextualize

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
what you are doing.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.960
And that makes me curious, how is that analysis done?

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Well, normally...

05:12.960 --> 05:18.040
How many resources are dedicated, depending on whether you do it more deeply or not, the

05:18.040 --> 05:21.200
decisions or the conclusions you make vary a lot.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
Correct.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.240
Let's see, first there is a superpower that investors have, and that is that we see a

05:25.240 --> 05:26.240
lot of companies.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.760
And then there is already a certain information of the context of the market that we have regarding

05:30.760 --> 05:31.760
several markets.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.560
But even so, we all have, if it is a business engineer, because he usually does it, if it

05:37.560 --> 05:42.520
is an investment fund or someone who operates with a more fixed structure, in our case

05:42.520 --> 05:46.920
there are a series of analysts who analyze that, who know the markets well, in some

05:46.920 --> 05:51.360
funds they are even verticalized, specialists only in fashion, etc.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.400
So obviously, the later and more resources you are going to dedicate to a company and the

05:55.400 --> 05:58.760
more you are going to invest, the deeper that analysis of the market.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.120
And above all, what is very important is to put this in context with the entrepreneur.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.440
Hey, this is like this, this is not like this.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.720
You have the competence, what is your differential advantage?

06:07.720 --> 06:10.800
And the composition of the place will be understood a little better.

06:10.800 --> 06:20.200
Having a small analysis of the team, that is, talking to the founders, understanding

06:20.200 --> 06:22.280
the dynamics that they have among them.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.920
It is super important how your shareholder table is designed.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.520
There are things that automatically put you in a business that is wonderful.

06:29.520 --> 06:35.320
If you are shareholders where the founders have 10% of the company, then automatically

06:35.320 --> 06:37.360
many investors are not going to invest.

06:37.360 --> 06:43.560
We like that founders have a lot of participation in the company.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.120
In the end, it is the guarantee that it will go well, that you create it and that it is your business.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.440
Yes, we have seen that if the founders, who are the ones who bring value within the team

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
of...

06:52.440 --> 06:57.760
Well, yes, within the founding team, if they are already very diluted because everyone has entered

06:57.760 --> 07:00.760
around them, then it is a complex situation.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
Correct.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
So that is one of the key points.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.040
For me, another of the points that is very important and that not so many people do is

07:06.040 --> 07:07.320
product analysis.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.400
And this is something that clashes a bit with the famous investment criteria.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.440
If we have said that two of our analysis legs of a good investor are technology and

07:16.440 --> 07:21.040
differential advantages, which are often interrelated with each other, if there is no

07:21.040 --> 07:23.880
product or analysis team, how is this going to be analyzed?

07:23.880 --> 07:27.800
That is, good investors have people who also analyze the product, because in the end, in

07:27.800 --> 07:31.680
many cases it is the basis of the competitive advantage.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.240
A financial analysis is done, a financial analysis of the legal part, which is one of the most important.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.400
And the legal part is not just about whether they have the contracts to date and such, which

07:40.400 --> 07:44.760
in the end most startups always have or have something that can be improved.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.880
Many times it has to do more, for example, with the partnership pact, how it is designed,

07:47.880 --> 07:51.800
if it has things that do not make much sense, etc.

07:51.800 --> 07:58.240
If all this is fulfilled and the company fits the criteria and others, it is when the company

07:59.200 --> 08:00.520
offers a deal.

08:00.520 --> 08:05.400
All this involves several processes of inquiries, information, etc.

08:05.400 --> 08:12.800
And above all, what is very important to understand and that sometimes companies miss,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.560
the investment of this style of companies is a risk investment.

08:16.560 --> 08:21.120
So it is not about investing the least bad, but the best.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.040
And this is a topic that sometimes we forget.

08:23.040 --> 08:28.000
We are thinking of mitigating a lot of risks and I do not want to go to the one that has the

08:28.040 --> 08:31.520
mitigated risks, but I want to go to the one that if it goes well, it will do better.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.800
And then that is the key.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.520
It is when all this happens, when the time comes to say, okay, now we are going to sign

08:36.520 --> 08:43.320
the famous term sheet, which is where I propose some conditions for investment, financial terms,

08:43.320 --> 08:44.960
legal and control terms, etc.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.520
And then a second negotiation process comes in.

08:47.520 --> 08:54.760
Ideally, everything is ok, there is usually a process of financial and legal due diligence,

08:54.920 --> 08:56.960
there is a third, independent.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.480
Or parallel to the negotiation.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.080
Typically it is usually, and here it depends on the moment in which we are entering.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.200
If it is a business, there is never a due diligence.

09:04.200 --> 09:09.800
It depends on the moment in which it invests and the risk that the investor takes,

09:09.800 --> 09:13.480
the more risk, the more you want to ensure that everything is controlled.

09:13.480 --> 09:17.240
So there is a due diligence that in the end what it does is analyze that everything you have said

09:17.240 --> 09:18.680
so far is true.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.640
If there is a golden rule in this world, it is that you never lie.

09:23.520 --> 09:30.320
Many times we sometimes say little lies because it is a shame that something is not in the company

09:30.320 --> 09:35.440
and we always say it in a lot of companies and we know the miseries that all the start-ups have

09:35.440 --> 09:37.280
and nothing happens, it is like that.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.440
But the worst thing you can do is tell a lie.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.360
Yes, because they will catch you.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.360
Always.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.880
They will catch you if the relationship continues, they will catch you for sure.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.400
Correct.

09:46.400 --> 09:51.680
So this, I always say that there is a very important factor and intangible in this analysis,

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
which is the beer factor.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.480
In other words, you always have to invest and you always have to let someone invest in you

09:56.480 --> 09:59.080
when you feel like having a beer.

09:59.080 --> 10:04.520
If not, at that moment, where we are in the moment of love idyll, when things get complicated

10:04.520 --> 10:07.680
and when they get complicated, it will be very complicated.

10:07.680 --> 10:12.320
That is a bit part of the initial analysis of the company.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.120
I do a review and if it is not correct, you tell me.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.120
Of course.

10:16.120 --> 10:21.520
The first thing you do is, professional investors like you, the first thing you do is,

10:21.560 --> 10:23.680
I call it short list, but you can call it whatever you want,

10:23.680 --> 10:26.680
and it is that you receive an ingenious amount of projects.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.680
Correct.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.680
Many people have not even read the criteria and they have not even sent them, but hey.

10:30.680 --> 10:35.680
And the point is that you have a series of filters or criteria or requirements, each one of yours.

10:35.680 --> 10:41.680
Imagine, my company, and I do not say startups, I say my company does not invest in companies

10:41.680 --> 10:45.680
from outside Europe, I do not invest in rounds of more than a million euros, I do not invest

10:45.680 --> 10:48.680
in the gambling sector, for example.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.840
You do not invest in B2B, whatever, but a series of criteria that are objective.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.840
And if you do not meet them, you do not pass.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.840
And this is like a filter in which many companies stay outside and others enter.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.840
Correct.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.840
The percentage will depend, right?

11:00.840 --> 11:01.840
They enter.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.840
So here come the criteria for evaluating the investment that you have told us about

11:04.840 --> 11:06.840
previously in another class.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.840
You told us about 5Ts, about the team, about the attraction, about the technology,

11:09.840 --> 11:11.840
you talked about the product too, which is very interesting.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.840
Here it is about analyzing the potential.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
That's it.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.840
That is, the first one, if you want, is a risk filter, and the second is just the opposite.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So, hey, if these guys do well in the business, how big can this business be?

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
You talked about the cap table, that they are not too deluded, you have a series of...

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Of analyzing the company.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
That, of analyzing the company.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
Subsequently, a small percentage receives an offer with the term sheet, which is the sheet of terms...

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Of terms where the operation is proposed.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
And a negotiation begins, which I understand will last, I don't know, a couple of months,

11:47.160 --> 11:48.160
I don't know what the deadline would be.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.160
It depends on the phase in which you are.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.160
There are many of these phases that, if you are talking about a business angel,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.160
they will be much faster, because many of the business angels,

11:56.160 --> 11:59.160
as you advance in the maturity process of the company,

11:59.160 --> 12:03.160
it weighs less on trust, that is, when you invest in the 3Fs,

12:03.160 --> 12:06.160
it is trusted by the founder or the founders, period.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
There is no other disquisition.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.160
The more you advance in the process, the weight of trust in the founder

12:11.160 --> 12:14.160
changes with the importance of the business.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.320
So, the heavier the business, the more relevant it is to analyze the business well.

12:17.320 --> 12:22.320
The business that invests close to this phase has a lot to do with the trust in the founder team

12:22.320 --> 12:24.320
and, of course, there are signs and missions of attraction.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.320
Indeed.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.320
And during the negotiation process, or the last part,

12:29.320 --> 12:34.320
the business angels, the most professional investors,

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
like venture capital, etc.,

12:36.320 --> 12:41.320
you do a due diligence, in which you basically raise the carpets

12:41.480 --> 12:43.480
and make sure that what they have told you is true

12:43.480 --> 12:46.480
and that there is no story that can compromise the potential.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.480
No relevant story.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.480
99% of companies have something, some nonsense,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.480
something that has happened to them,

12:53.480 --> 12:56.480
that is, there is nothing that can really put the operation in danger.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.480
That's it.
