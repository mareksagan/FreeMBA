WEBVTT

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.000
And that we will analyze the case

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.160
of the pinnacle, it is the neighborhood

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.680
you are promoting and building that

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.440
is exceptional, it is a

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.820
wonderful thing, and to understand

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.500
it well we will analyze it with

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.700
the tools of the blue ocean strategy,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.580
I will go to you to make questions

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060
and we will go to answer in a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.100
more or less concrete way, the

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.680
first, the blue ocean strategy

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.540
says to us that creating a proposal

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.360
totally different from the competitors,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.680
we can address a target

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.740
audience that until now we call

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.080
no customers, because it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.480
is people to whom the others

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.660
have not thought to address,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.420
in your case, who would

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.960
be the no customers?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.260
Yes, in the end we, the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.340
important thing is not only who are

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.520
the customers, but how you get to them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.460
too, because of course, when the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.980
traditional model of me picked up

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.880
and I create a new block of housing,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.780
I put a poster and the people who

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.140
pass by there see the poster,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.500
then you are already going to a local

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.940
audience, etc., etc., with which

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.600
in the end the people who approach

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.740
us is very varied and are

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.900
all these different profiles with

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.980
which we begin to co-create the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.140
solution, then in the end in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640
front of local public, in the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.120
end we, the people we

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.540
have is, why has to be only

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.100
families?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.220
Why can't we be single grandparents?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.720
Why can't we have an international

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.080
audience who sees Valencia

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.000
as an extraordinary place

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.720
to have my family while

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.040
I travel around the world?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.980
If we focus more on the customer

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.640
than on the product, we can actually

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.140
reach a much larger audience

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.340
and focus on another dimension,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.020
right?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.600
This is a clear case of non-customers.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.540


00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.820
Are you capturing people, I don't

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.540
know.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.280
at all levels.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.760
People who, let us say, if you,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160
if the pinnacle did not exist,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.860
would you choose to rent?

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.520
Yes, I think that in the end we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.760
think more about room solutions,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.260
that is, how would you like

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.940
to live?

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.340
And that makes sense to you,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.740
right?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.700
We talk about even giving yourself

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880
flexibility for your different moments

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.920
of life, right?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.100
Since you are single, you have children,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.820
many children.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:46.840
Well, this is one of the factors...

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.700
Because there are people who see a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.440
little rental as my second option

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.520
if I can't buy it, right?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.780
But don't think about, hear, and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.360
if there were flexible options that allowed

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.460
me to, right?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.880
Separate what is, when I buy,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.700
what is real estate business

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.200
and use, separate those

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440
two and say which is the most

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.760
interesting use for me.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.140
And then the other thing goes apart,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.880
right?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.280
The real estate business.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.080
So, not only are we creating

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.900
new people, new permissions

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.300
of people, but also, hear,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.700
room solutions that can be much

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.660
more interesting for other

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.320
people.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.960
And you're finally creating new proposals,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.640
right?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.060
There are no other things

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.120
in Spain, right?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.740
To that we go now.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.600
We will analyze the proposals, the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.240
competitive factors that we call

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.560
the variables of a traditional

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.220
promoter of the sector, because

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.880
it is that more are super homogeneous.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.980
And then we will start to think,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.520
to identify on the move what

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.380
are the components you have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.960
added, because flexibility

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640
you just named it and I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.580
think it is clear.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.480
First, it is important to figure

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.020
out what a promoter is offering.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.520


00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.200
Yes, you think you think, right?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.060
What is it offering?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.460
Because it is a physical site,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.500
a physical event, it is linked

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.680
to a location.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.120
The location is very clear, the real

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.900
estate sector always.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.060
Then, after that, as you sell it is,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.200
hear, this is the price that these

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.140
houses have, this is what there is,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.880
it enters or does not enter, with

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.820
which the issue of affordability,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820
that equality, budget, would

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.300
be the other dimension.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.820
And well, we can talk about

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.900
configurations, qualities,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.880
finishes, etc., right?

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.960
But it's very thoughtful about the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.400
product, isn't it?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.120
That, let's say, what it is, this last

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.300
is very thought out in the product,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.900
isn't it?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.020
And we turn him a little.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.260
It is worth, then, if we draw the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.360
strategic picture we have in the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.680
sector, and I am totally agree

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.360
with you, that no one has thought

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.220
outside of location, price

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.320
and qualities.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.720
We can draw several curves.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.200
Premium housing in the most expensive

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.620
areas, cheap housing

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.060
just below, and so on.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.680
And you have begun to incorporate

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.860
many components that no one

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.220
had thought that is what

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.680
makes your proposal absolutely

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.460
different.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.260
But we will make an effort to identify

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.360
them, they are very many, but to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.840
identify them and to concrete them.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.080
You talked about flexibility.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.340
Sometimes we don't sell

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.780
housing, we sell living.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.100
So this is the client's plan where

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.600
you say, well, and you, how you

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.520
want to live, right?

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.360
So you start thinking, well, what's

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.480
your budget, what's a framework,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.260
isn't it?

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.640
And from there, how do you like to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.100
live and what solution can make sense,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.500
right?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.580
For example, the other day, we have

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.600
a customer who said, no, look,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.940
I would like to buy and, because

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.660
I was not aware of other

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.660
options, and I have 70,000 euros,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.780
and I have two children,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.400
right?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.060
So, of course, this is

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.640
totally out of the market with

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.800
a construction cost and a

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.900
home you need for two children.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.740
Because when you start talking and you

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.360
say, well, and you, hear, what you

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.500
like to share, what not, what are you

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.260
willing to do, right?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.440
Then, of course, you end up, for

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.280
example, thinking of a more type exclusion,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.500
a co-housing that is, look, you

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.840
have a private part, which are

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.440
40 square meters, where you have your

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.620
most intimate area, let's say,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360
and then you share certain

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.480
things, and since the guest room,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.400
because it doesn't make sense

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.540
that it's yours, why not share

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.840
it with 10 more neighbors?

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.120
Share and share, another.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.300
of course.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.280
Sharing and sharing space.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.700
Never in life has this been done, i.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.620
e., in a middle school, but it has

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.720
not been.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.600
These are new solutions.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.480
So you're not on the plane of what

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.780
your budget is, but, hear, how you

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.640
like to live and what can we

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.720
do with that budget, right?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.000
So sharing is important,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.500
right?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.660
And then, in the end, we see it more

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.740
from the dimension also of, hear,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.440
that makes your life simple, right?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.900
That is, you are a series of centralized

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.960
services that are offered to you,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.000
that simplifies your life,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.320
right?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.020
It helps you to reconcile, it

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.900
helps you save time.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.540
Reconciliation, saving time,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.760
saving costs, you talked to

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.180
me, saving energy costs.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.120
Well, that's what others think.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.740
But cost savings in general, right?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.400
It's like a place that given your

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.700
budget is the most spectacular

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.260
place, isn't it?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.700
What cost savings, what more

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.260
cost savings to understand, to illustrate,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.600
what more cost savings would

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.400
you have?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.580
After all, time is money,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.300
right?

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.880
So all that that makes your

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.600
life easier can save you

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.300
money, right?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.700
But well, in the end, we would

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.520
start to bundle services, for

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.920
example, utilities, would we?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.800
Then, put water, electricity

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.680
and telco.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.180
Of course, with a certain

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.480
scale of 4,000 people, you

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.880
can get a lot better contracts,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.940
right?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.080
Even throw your own fiber,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.840
etc., etc., right?

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.240
And that ultimately results in a savings,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.620
right?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.440
Hear, designing houses with a

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.280
little common sense, bioclimate

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.500
houses, etc., you can save

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.640
a lot of money, right?

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.760
So these are like many things.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.560
So, almost our game is more of saving

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.580
you money and offering you

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.260
something that adds value to you.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.580
We will be able to find more things

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.280
that will bring concrete value.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.660
and yes.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.780
Let's give examples, because I think

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.300
it's better to understand than how...

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.900
Yes, with some examples.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.180
We are talking about the matter of, for example,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.800
the cave, right?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.880
Instead of buying a cave,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.500
as we rent it to you as

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.760
you need it, you don't return

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.540
it, right?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.200
So that will save you money,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.680
right?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.400
In other words, the furniture

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.780
equipment and such will

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.360
be shared, you will offer it in...

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.280
We will offer it.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.100
But in the end it is almost like...

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.840
We talk a little about living accessories

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.500
because at the end of the day...

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.440
You spend a lot of time when you are

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.540
going to move a place, the furniture,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.540
I don't know what...

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.620
You simplify this process,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.240
right?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.480
Simplify me, right?

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.140
There will be people who are, no, I

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.080
am who want to go to the last detail

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.760
and so, well, then organize

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.340
it you.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.240
But many people are of...

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.040
I want to spend time

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.460
in life or what is important.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.080
Make it easy, right?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.760
The easy.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.060
It seems spectacular.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.160
More...

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.620
More...

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.440
Any other service?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.660
Two or three to help?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.440
Both are examples.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.620
But you could almost tell what you

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.960
spend your money on and how we can help you.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.980
We will not think about...

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.000
Not what you spend on housing,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.920
but what you spend on living.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.520
and mobility.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.000
You are going to the mountain...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.380
For example, there will be car

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.260
sharing services.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.040
Yes for example.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.080
On demand, etc.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.980
You like to go to the mountains,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.720
okay.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.720
And you have...

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.320
Well, and then...

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.280
For example, when you go to the

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.680
mountain, don't take a backpack

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.320
to get your child.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.680
It makes sense that you have it.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.420
We cannot help you.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.920
But if in six months it weighs more

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.380
and no longer serves that backpack.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.420
Why does it make sense?

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.700
That's the same with kids, right?

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.020
The sports pack.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.760
Imagine it, right?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.520
Or the bike.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680
You should buy a bike

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.960
or a bike door, right?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.320
Even the bike or the car car children

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.060
of the bike.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.600
If nothing changes your weight, it is no

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.260
longer worth it.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.560
The bike is off.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.000
Why not put this into the

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.900
mobility pack?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.640
Even even.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.360
Education as well?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.300
Yes to education.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.520
It is a bit separate.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.560
It is within the environment.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.580
In the end, it is in our school.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.480
The school is an

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.800
independent community.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.960
Is it worth?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.160
to separate.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.360
I thought a little and the pin.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.620
It has many sides.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.880
Because the neighborhood itself is

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.920
also a space for experimentation,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.140
learning, postanpraty and so on.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.320
There are three more schools in

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.220
the neighborhood.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.920
But it's not a pack, say, as such that

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.160
the neighborhood offers you.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.880
Let us talk about health.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:27.760
No is?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.340
And many other things.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.000
Health as well.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.860
I do not know.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.820
How much time do you waste on taking

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.660
your child to the pedestrian, right?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.660
Up the car, down the car.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.740
Can we make it easier for you?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.720
And you go to...

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.740
Another factor...

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.760
Well, it is an incredible thing this.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.440
Another factor I am thinking, that

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.880
I'm sure you've already thought

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.820
about, but to concrete it and to draw

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.920
it in the picture, you're going to generate,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.660
you're going to help, in addition

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.840
to how you save costs to families

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.460
that live, you're going to help

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.180
generate, say, more wealth?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.460
of course.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.440
How is?

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.180
With some example?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.840
I tell you as an anecdote.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.040
I told a father...

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.620
He is...

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.780
He said, oysters, because I am going,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.820
I mount a cake shop that I have always

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.680
wanted to mount.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.860
So, our idea at the end is also to

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.340
direct the spending we will have

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.820
in the neighborhood towards more

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.940
socially and environmentally

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.040
responsible companies.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.040
Even the promotion of employment of

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.260
disadvantaged and recursive collectives,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.480
right?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.600
So this is an important aspect

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.980
of social impact for us,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.500
isn't it?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.540
So, in the end, when you have

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.960
a community and you know your neighbors,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.600
what about it? even taking advantage

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.680
of technology, you can facilitate

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.460
interactions, that

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.800
creates opportunities

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.340
for many investments,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.960
business, many

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960
aspects.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.520
Let it be easy for your neighbors.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.660
Of course, we will respect a little

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.640
how they want to live, but we would

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.200
make life easier, among which it

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.800
is a source of income, for example,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.460
isn't it?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.100
Possibly, depending on the connections.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.920
So if the example of...

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.600
I would love a natural juice

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.900
site in the neighborhood.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.220
I am willing to pay 1,000 euros.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.180
We are doing a crowdfunding and

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.580
we are ready to...

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.020
You too?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.680
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.900
What will this do?

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.920
Being someone from the neighborhood can be

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.580
someone from the outside.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.120
And now I also get profit

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.960
from what I am benefiting from.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.860
I don't take my money and give it

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.160
to the bank and know what it is

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.360
doing.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.460
I use it to improve my

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.380
environment.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.820
Yes, yes yes yes

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.260
By the way, and the better my environment,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.680
the more will be worth my investment.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.820
You will organize a crowdfunding

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.960
campaign to promote the wealth

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.300
of the people.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.980
and potentially.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.520
With business within...

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.420
Making business, making stories.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.180
And, to see, our idea is not just this

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.840
is a site that you close it, it

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.040
is totally permeable.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.760
Many of the things we do...

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.860
Why can't they be applied

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.900
elsewhere?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.620
In neighborhoods that are not ours, right?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.900
So, I think that in the end the potential

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.580
of inspiration is one, just like

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.160
being a referent.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.640
But also, you hear, if these

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.160
services we develop are economically

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.320
viable at our scale, probably

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.920
the more it scales,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.640
the better.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.380
Yes indeed.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.800
And when, for example, you ask for one

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.920
of mobility, you're thinking of mobility

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.140
at the metropolitan level, you're not

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.080
moving from here to the supermarket.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.920
So I think those things can be

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.300
interesting, you hear, we are validating

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.340
things that can then

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.480
be scaled to another dimension.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.960
And that has contributed to a greater

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.660
impact, right?

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.420
and Genius.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.560
I think we are already getting

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.080
the idea.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.320
We are making the idea of...

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.760
The spectacular value proposal.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.960
And now, to finish, what I want

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.580
is that you transmit us because

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.700
that also helps what is what

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.280
happens, what are the consequences

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.160
of this.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.680
That is, you haven't said it before,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.760
but what are the results when

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.100
you are able to create a blue

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.400
ocean, as we call it, which

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.340
is absolutely differential.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.800
What are the consequences?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.760
The consequences as...

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.620
I mean the results, right?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.720
But in the end you...

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.900
The demand...

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.440
Of course, yes, yes, at the end you would

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.180
say, look, within my indicators we

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.860
would have, if we think of sustainability,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.340
we think of economic, social

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.520
and environmental sustainability,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.680
in that you start to define

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.900
all your indicators associated

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.300
with it and how we will measure

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.400
the impact.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.760
The financial network?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.220
So, you know, what cash flow

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.880
do I generate?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.440
well is.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.760
No is?

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.140
by ROE?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.700
I'm talking about measuring it.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.700
Of course, obviously you will

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.540
use the metrics that are totally

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.360
differential, you will also use

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.500
metrics different from the sector,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.060
but from the normal parameters

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.660
of how any promoter would

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.280
measure it, that is...

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.580
Yes, but in the end it is this, you

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.020
would measure, as a promoter you would

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.920
say, no, so how much, no, how much margin

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.500
I have taken from this promotion.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.940
Then in the end this would

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.800
be introduced into, hear,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.180
no, economically, as my margins are

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.840
different.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.100
That is, well, let's complete

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.940
it, how many houses do you have,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.060
you said before, how many houses

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.820
have you sold?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.560
That could be an indicator.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.620
That is, it is the main indicator that

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.620
is common in the standard sector.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.380
Yes, but we will sell.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560
Let's say, traditionally it would

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.040
be how many I have sold and with

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.360
margin taken, that would be the traditional,

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.500
but we don't think in terms

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.420
of...

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.480
Yes, yes, but what I want to

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.060
illustrate is what happens at the

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.600
level of results when you are able

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.340
to create a blue ocean.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.840
Of course, you end up creating more

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.860
financial, social value, well, let's

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.520
say, according to the concerns

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.480
for us, it is important also

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.220
the creation of social and environmental

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.100
value.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.500
of course.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.100
Similarly, in another sector, another

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.080
that is a blue ocean, will have

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.320
its own motivations for us.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.960
We want to show that, hear, look, it's

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.280
not that we end up making more money

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.940
in a certain way, right?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.800
And then we will see what we do

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.360
with that money, that you

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.500
can reinvest it to the

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.120
community, etc.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.980
But let's say that as a company

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.060
you could end up generating more

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.700
financial returns, but it is that

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.700
you will also create social

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.140
cohesion, collective income

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.780
in rivers, you will create better

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.680
health, you will reduce

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.940
your carbon footprint, etc.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.440
Then all that is a range and you can

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.560
already start thinking about biodiversity

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.220
at the environmental level,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.840
inclusive, accessibility too.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.140
So this is a whole range of indicators

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.520
in a certain way, but that's

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.060
much wider than just what

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.920
would be in this sector you're

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.600
looking at, right?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.000
Yes yes.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.300
So almost, almost our conviction

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.240
is that in enduring sustainable

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.480
models like these, in the end, it's

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.300
that you do everything goes faster,

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.700
better, and everyone sticks

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.340
to more.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.760
In all dimensions, the inhabitants,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.840
the municipalities, the

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.500
planet, etc. etc.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.220
And almost, it's hardly that you sacrifice

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.020
financial returns for others, right?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.240
You're going to do your best, right?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.020
And that is what we are convinced,

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.240
and we would like this to be

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.380
an example of how to do it well.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.000
In a sector, in addition, that is a sector

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.400
that we come from a very perverse world,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.100
isn't it?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.480
If we ask people who is the

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.200
culprit of the crisis,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.800
right?

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.840
The promoters, the promoters,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.420
etc.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.960
When you really think, right?

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.360
How does it affect us where we live

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.180
and the environment we live in our lives,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:49.640
right?

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.640
Well, I end up congratulating

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.200
you, I think it's spectacular

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.440
what you're doing.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.220
I have not lost anything in Valencia,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.500
but I think I will live there.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.060
And here is Charly with me too.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.040
and beast!

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.680
Nothing, thank you very much.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:08.820
to you.
