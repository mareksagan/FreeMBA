00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.780
The concept of segmentation is very

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.680
simple, I think everyone understands

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.560
it and is, segmentation consists

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.000
of analyzing the total market

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.580
or your current customers that is

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.620
also done with your current customers

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.180
to identify segments that

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.440
are smaller groups that have

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.600
to have within each group

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.640
a few features, something

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.160
specific that helps you to adapt

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.720
your proposals, your messages,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.680
etc., to each of those

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.800
groups, that there is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460
adaptation, that in this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.260
consists.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.660
But what happens is that everyone

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.780
understands this but almost

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.020
nobody segments well and why?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.580
What do you have to be good at?

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.980
You have to know all the segmentation

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560
variables that we will see later,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.720
you have to know them all,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.780
you have to incorporate

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.580
them all into your analysis.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.540
What are the segmentation variables?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.300
These are the perspectives

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.520
or criteria of analysis

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760
that we use to study the market.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.020
They are like those lupites, aren’t they?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.940
You have a market or you have your

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400
customers and you can study them from

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.560
many different perspectives,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.460
because where they live, what they

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.640
want, what they feel, why they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.940
buy you, etc.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.960
These are the different

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.360
perspectives, criteria or

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.540
segmentation variables.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.060
You have to know them all.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.400
You have to keep in mind that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.920
when you do what you do is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.360
to introduce a segmentation

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.300
variable, because I have my target

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.240
market here and analyze it from

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.220
the perspective of geography,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.420
the simplest.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.700
For each segmentation variable,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.000
you will get a few segments.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.380
If you use geography, you will

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.940
find people living in the United

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.280
States, Madrid or Logroño.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.120
Or if you are segmenting by neighborhoods,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.200
then in each of the neighborhoods,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.600
if you are a hairdressing

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.560
chain, for example.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.240
So why do people do it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.700
badly?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.960
Why do companies not know how to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.660
segment well?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.980
Do the test.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.140
Ask a businessman or an entrepreneur.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.620
The information you provide and the information

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.160
you provide does not give you much information.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.920
The common mistakes are two

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.500
that you shouldn’t make.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.060
One is that people are usually

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760
limited to the basic segmentation

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.240
variables.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.920
So you ask yourself, what are your segments?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.220
I have men and women

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.700
of this age, etc.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.080
This is fine, you know, but you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.860
can’t stay alone here.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.360
There are a lot of things you are losing.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.360
And there’s another, another common mistake

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.360
and is that people don’t make

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.740
the effort to keep segmenting

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.200
their customers especially.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.420
When you learn to segment, that you’

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.880
re going to learn today and these

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.240
days, what you have to do is do it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.320
continuously, all your life.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.940
My current clients, I have to study

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.340
them again because there is something

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.840
that will be escaping me.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700
Each time we do this, we learn

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.180
a lot of things that allow

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.780
us to adapt our proposal,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.700
sell more, evolve

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.540
the pitch of the commercials,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.440
etc.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.100
There are two mistakes.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.000
That the solutions you know, the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.460
solutions is that you know

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.280
all the segmentation

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.360
variables we will see now and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.220
that you also be aware that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.680
you have to do it all your life.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.140
You have to be constantly using

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.940
those variables to study your

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.720
target market of your current

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.980
customers because you’ll go

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.620
learning and learning and learning.
