00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.790
Traditional management, everything

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.410
we have learned is harmful.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.350
It's a very radical signature

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.770
and it may surprise, but

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.930
it's true.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.890
I have always been surprised

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.970
by the fact that managers who

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.870
have had a lot of professional

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.870
success in large companies, with

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.950
a great academic training,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.910
etc., are much less prepared

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.200
to undertake and in fact fail

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.070
more than much younger people,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.270
with less life experience,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.730
professional,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.170
academic, etc.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.230
And it is due to this.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.550
It is because all the principles

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.690
we have learned in traditional

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.690
management are thought

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990
of for another environment

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.730
that usually lead you to make

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.630
bad decisions.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.570
Well, to begin, really if we look

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.130
at the topics, in the areas

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.370
that have always been studied,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.670
because in business schools,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.510
in universities, etc., good

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.850
because strategy, marketing,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.810
human resources, finance,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.530
accounting, etc., operations,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.330
leadership, never really has

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.010
been put any focus on helping

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.530
students to undertake.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.490
This assignment has not been taken into account.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.430
It begins to incorporate because the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.870
world of startups is revolutionizing

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.070
the economy in general, the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.370
world of the company, but until

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.610
now it had not been taken

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.230
into account.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.490
So we could say that until now

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.610
we had not been given knowledge,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.890
we were a little blind, didn'

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.450
t we?

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.870
But as I said, I go further.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.430
I think that not only do we go

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.570
blind, but what we have learned

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.390
is harmful.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.890
And why?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.490
I will explain it to you.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.350
Well, I think that undertaking is the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.690
ability to convert an idea you have,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.110
a vision into a business model

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.270
that is sustainable and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670
profitable, but there is an important

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.850
feature and is that it is usually

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.170
given in an environment

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.130
of certain uncertainty.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.590
Uncertainty is the word.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.670
In a chaotic environment, where you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.790
don't know what's going to

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.010
happen, you don't know how

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.050
customers will respond, you don'

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.970
t know how the market will respond, etc.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.350
So, everything we have learned,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.290
the key is that everything we have

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.970
learned, is thought of or is born

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.690
from a different environment, from

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.550
an environment of much greater security.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.930
We have been taught how to plan, we have been

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.610
taught how to execute, but we have not

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.630
been taught how to handle ourselves in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690
an environment with high uncertainty.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.310
So the fact that we have acquired

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.170
all those knowledge,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.150
that we have already integrated

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.710
it into our way of thinking

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.290
in our DNA, makes us worse

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.830
entrepreneurs, makes us less

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.310
flexible, makes us give,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.090
of course, many things

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.410
that we shouldn't give,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.230
of course.
