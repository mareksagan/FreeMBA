WEBVTT

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.340
Over the past 10 years we have

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.420
analyzed companies of all kinds.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.320
We have worked with

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.780
multinationals, we have worked with

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.120
family companies, we have worked

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.240
with start-ups and if we had

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.640
to determine or highlight a factor

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.000
above the others that we consider

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
to be determinant of the sustained

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.280
medium-term success of a company,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.680
we are not talking about a balloon,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.940
we are talking about creating

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.940
a company that is sustainable,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.360
that is healthy, because we would

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
not talk about the business model,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560
we would not talk about

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.800
the entry barriers, we would

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.860
not talk about scalability,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.200
we would not talk about

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600
efficiency in operations, etc.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960
Above all that, if we had

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.080
to highlight one factor, we

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560
would highlight the ability

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.520
to orient customers.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.660
What does this mean?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.560
It is now called a customer-

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.900
centric company.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.660
How can we define this?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.140
Well, look, basically companies,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.200
and this is the reality, make

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.380
decisions always thinking

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.860
about themselves.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.480
And I would like you to make

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.120
the diagnosis, look around,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.340
think about your company, your

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.860
job, whatever it is, and really

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.780
ask yourself if the decisions

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.100
you are making every day,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.640
the plans you are making,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.980
etc., where is the customer

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.900
there?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.960
Are you thinking about bringing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.980
more value to customers or are

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.500
you thinking about your own benefits?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.700
Are you thinking about selling more,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.420
earning more money, etc., in the bonus,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.380
whatever it is?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.460
Because 99% of companies, 99%

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.700
of the time, make decisions

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.140
thinking of their own interests.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.000
And when we talk about

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.820
an organization that

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.020
is truly customer-centric, a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.760
paradigm change has to be made.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.600
You always have to think

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.720
about the customers first.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.020
That is, make decisions that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.060
are oriented to the benefit of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760
customers, not your own benefit.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.760
I will give you an anecdote.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.560
FranÃ§ois Michelin, Michelin's CEO

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.940
for many years, made a very

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.500
controversial decision in the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.800
Board of Directors.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.440
It was suggested that a new technology

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.920
had emerged that would allow

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.640
them to increase or triple

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.200
the durability, the duration

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.780
of the tyres.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.180
Of course, keep in mind that this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.820
leads you to the rotation, forgive

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.480
me, to the customer repetition

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.880
being lower, that is, you'll

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.860
sell less.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.180
The rest of the Board

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.000
of Directors was absolutely

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.960
against implementing

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.140
this new technology.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.880
And Michelin's saying is, if

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.480
it's good for our customers,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.400
it's good for us.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.960
In the end, as he commanded,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.860
the new technology was implanted,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.220
Michelin tyres improved a lot

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.460
and with decisions like this

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.540
has managed to be the leader

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.520
for the last 30 years.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.780
It is a proof that when you make

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.460
decisions that may seem at the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.540
time that are against nature,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.600
you make decisions thinking about the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.840
benefits of the customer and not

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.940
your own benefits, in the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.980
end, in the medium term, you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.600
are sure to make better.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.160
We will continue to compare

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.280
the differences between companies

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.580
that are self-centered and those

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.780
that are customer-centered.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.620
We can say that the customer

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.140
is usually a means.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.700
Businesses, their mission is to make

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.040
more money and the customer is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.740
a means to do so.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.760
But we should take this to the extreme

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.060
and we should think that the customer

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.100
is a goal, that your mission is to generate

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.080
more value to the customer.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.460
And I guarantee you that if you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.640
do this, in the end, the results

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.040
and business goals will go better.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.940
Another difference in focusing

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.780
is, what is it that almost

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.880
all companies do?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.960
They create products and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.660
services and they push them.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.180
It is a push strategy, pushing

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.760
them into a market where there

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.900
are more competitors.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.360
Well, if you are really

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180
customer-centric, what you're going

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.300
to do is, you're going to devote a lot

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.400
of your effort to understanding

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.640
your customers, to know what hurts

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.880
them, to think about how you

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.220
can bring them more value.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.100
And you will develop value proposals

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.360
that are adapted to that.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.840
What is it you will?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.340
That instead of having to push your

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.120
products into the market, the demand

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.600
for your product will grow and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.660
you will be bought.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.380
Finally, companies usually

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.100
define goals and metrics

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.920
that are aligned with

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.280
those goals.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.140
And what are they?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.700
You can sell more, earn more money, etc.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.900
Where is the customer here?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.180
Nowhere at all.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.400
As I said, the client is

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.580
a means to that goal.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.440
Well, the customer-centric

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.660
companies do what they do is, in addition

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.080
to the usual metrics, because all

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.780
the companies in the world obviously

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.220
have a few goals, sales, profits,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.320
etc., we have to incorporate

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.320
metrics that are representative

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.680
of that we are generating

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.780
more value to our customers,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.360
that we will see them.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.920
Well, I think that with this you can

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.780
already get quite a bit of the idea

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.000
that the reality is that the vast

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.820
majority of companies are

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.460
focused on their goals.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.260
But this is good, that is, it's

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.300
an opportunity, because the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.680
few companies we think of

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.740
the real customer, what we

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.320
find is that we generate

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.580
competitive advantages very quickly.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.360
And look, I'll give you more examples.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.220
Let's talk about Amazon, for example.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.120
Jeff Bezos has always said he wants to

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.920
be the world's most customer-centered

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.500
company.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.180
What does this mean from the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.620
customer's perspective?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.460
Well, because I have lived it many times.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.220
Amazon has surprised me many

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.380
times, especially in the after-

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.400
sales service.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.100
In the return policy, for

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.780
example.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.600
You want to return a product, you return

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.300
it and you are almost not asked any questions.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.880
They come to your house for this product.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.160
Sometimes you don't even have

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.420
to return the product you bought.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.400
I will give you a closer example,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.680
such as Mercadona.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.220
At Mercadona, I have heard many

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.700
times from Mercadona customers who

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.020
value the fact that within the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.820
stores they find it very easy

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.220
to find all the products.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.300
And instead, there have been other

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300
chains that what they have always

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.760
done is seeking to increase, looking

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.400
to make attach or cross-

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.300
sell, that is, to increase something,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.160
the average ticket, the shopping

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.900
basket, what they do is

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.200
small modifications of the

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.560
routes, where the products are

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.340
located, etc.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.880
Because they can sell a little

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.740
more because they are distracting you.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.360
But really, from a customer

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.420
perspective that is the best,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.160
what you want is that it's easier

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.580
for you.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.040
Well, the proof is that Mercadona

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.340
has grown much more than the others

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.640
in recent years and has become

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.460
the undisputed leader

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.560
in the sector.
