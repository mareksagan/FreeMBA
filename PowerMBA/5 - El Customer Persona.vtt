00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.350
To begin with, what I'm going to

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.770
do is explain how things have been

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.950
done so far, because it will help

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.910
you understand the difference

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.830
with the customer person.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.370
Traditionally, companies have done

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.530
what they have done is to segment,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.010
that is, you identify a series of

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.310
segmentation variables, it doesn't

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150
matter, the ones they are, age, gender,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.450
level of studies, geography,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.510
it doesn't matter.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.790
From those variables, you

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.030
enter those variables in a search

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.750
and you get some segments.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.830
And then what you do is to evaluate or

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.590
analyze which segments you are going

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.930
to target, which is targeting.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.170
But in any case, your target is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.130
a set of people, it is a mass

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.890
or it is a statistic.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.290
But it turns out that your customers

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.790
are people, like you and me.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.550
And the companies have done what they have

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.250
done is depersonalize it all and a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.510
lot of things are lost.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.790
And here the customer person enters,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.030
that is, instead of introducing a

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.450
series of variables, what we will

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.230
do is we will create or we will

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.410
identify or we will analyze

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.790
who and how our customers are.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.490
What is the Customer Person?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.370
Basically, it is a fictional representation

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.090
of your ideal customer, your ideal

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.210
customer, or your ideal customers.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.630
We will describe how it is, we

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.650
will put a photo of it, we will

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.030
put names, we will analyze what

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.650
it likes, we will analyze what

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.950
their hobbies are, we will analyze

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.310
why you buy us, we will analyze

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.570
how you buy us, what it hurts,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.050
who you consult, we will do

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.750
it as detailed as possible.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.880
So what we're going to do is turn

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.320
that target, that mass, that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.980
statistics, into one or several

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.020
real people, because it will

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.040
help us understand it much better.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.180
What is the customer

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.900
person for?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.880
All these tools

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.960
require effort.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.260
And I want you to visualize or understand

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660
what the profit a business generates,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300
because otherwise you will never

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280
apply it, you will not take it seriously.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.820


00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.900
The customer person helps

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.380
you to understand your target

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.860
customer much better.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.120
This has a huge impact on

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.060
all areas of business.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.300
If you are able to know well what

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.740
are the problems, needs, motivations

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.100
of your client, at a strategic

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.620
level you will be able

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.360
to adapt your value proposals.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.040


00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.280
You will be able to create value

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.060
proposals that are fully

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.680
targeted at the customer's problem.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.160
And at a more tactical level, if we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.420
talk about marketing, for

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.840
example, usually the customer person

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.640
is used by the marketing departments.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.720
It allows you to shoot more accurately.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.420
Why is?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.680
I can give you thousands of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.880
examples.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.400
We will look at what kind of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.440
blogs or media you are consulting.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.460
Let's analyze what social

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.200
media you use, when and how you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.920
use them.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.760
We will analyze what type of

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.780
content you find attractive and we

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.720
can create content tailored to your

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.180
interests.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.660
Let's look at what kind of influencers

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.140
you are following.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.540
We will analyze whether, for example,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.120
consult or not to other people

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.340
when you want to buy us.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.620
All this information to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740
the marketing department, to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.960
the marketing managers is

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.080
real gold.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.320
Because it allows them to shoot much

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.460
more efficiently and more effectively.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.200
Look, I will give you an example.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.380
Lifelong sellers, good sellers,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.920
make an effort to know

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.040
who they have in front

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.000
of them.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.500
And they use tactics such as remembering

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.920
the name of the client's wife or

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.860
husband, knowing if they like a football

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.400
team or another, etc.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.360
Why is?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.220
It allows them to adapt messages.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.200
The customer person is the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.120
same.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.580
What happens is that we will do

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.920
so that the entire company knows

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.740
our customer well and so everyone

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.080
when making decisions take them

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.100
with the target customer in

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.860
their head.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.360
I think we all understand

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.040
the benefits of having or

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.260
having created our customer

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.060
person.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.900
And now what we're going to do is,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.600
let's see how we can create one.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.840
To get a little idea, the first

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.700
thing I'll do is share

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.600
some with you.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.300
Simply as an example.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.760
Look, as you usually see, you get

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.380
a name, you incorporate a photo

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.040
and what you do is incorporate

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.720
information of a different type.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.620
And I don't want to go into the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.000
details, but here in this case

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.860
because a coffee shop is explaining

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.320
how a day is in Sara's life, what

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.240
is her background, her

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.460
financial situation, her

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.820
online behaviors, etc.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.380
Here we have another, in this case Rachel,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.480
who loves home.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.380
Well, it's a bit, the blocks

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.420
are a bit similar.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.160
The personal background, the background

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.680
at business level, work, your

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.000
lifestyle, your challenges, your

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.200
problems, where you are looking for information.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.120
Well, really the first step to

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.660
create a customer person is to choose

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.560
the questions or choose the information

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.960
that we will collect and that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.240
we will incorporate from

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.260
our customer.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.960
This is the first step and really

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.840
is the crucial phase, because not

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.000
for all companies the same

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.360
information is important.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.420
And I'm going to leave you a simple

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.060
scheme with two slides, with

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.380
a series of fields or questions.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.020
I divided them into two blocks.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640
The first of the blocks,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.360
information related to who and

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.340
how is our customer, regardless

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.500
of their relationship

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.120
with us.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.960
So, the questions you can choose

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.240
are thousands, but I here put

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.540
you because general data,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.200
could be age, gender, if

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.160
you are married, no, etc.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.040
Information about your lifestyle,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.960
your tastes and hobbies, your motivations

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.360
and dreams, how it is

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.420
a day in your life.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.780
This is very important, this incorporates

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.160
many people one day in their lives.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.820
Why is?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.780
Because if you understand what your daily

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.580
habits are, it's easier to

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.620
get to that person.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.000
It is easier to adapt your entire

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.900
marketing tactics.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.100
I'll also give you a second slide

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.280
with other questions.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.500
And in this case they are related

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.480
to how our customer person

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.800
relates to us.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.120
That is, it is no longer a purely

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.300
objective question of how he or she is.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.220
If we are analyzing the relationship,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.720
what is the problem, what

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.260
is the pain we have to solve,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.880
how it solves that problem

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.080
at present.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.940
Imagine, for example, that you

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.420
are buying a competitive product.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.840
What do you look for in our product?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.100
What is the real motivation you are looking

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.800
for?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.900
Where do you seek information?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.220
How do you find us?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.000
How is the purchase process?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.200
This is very important.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.920
Take a decision immediately,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.260
consult with someone, etc.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.280
Influencers, what I told you, consult

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.800
the decision with someone, buy

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.260
alone, alone, buy together

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.320
with someone, etc.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.060
What are the main objections

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.960
to our product,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.060
our service?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.940
Well, these are questions or fields

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.920
that I suggest.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.660
But really, when you have to make

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.760
your personal card, what I recommend

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760
is that you start from these

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.600
and also do some online research

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.360
and get inspired by thousands

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.920
of customer person that

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.260
are published.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.780
Finally, let's make a summary

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.820
of how a customer person

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.560
is made.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.400
The first thing is to identify

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.880
well or choose the questions that

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.940
are appropriate.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.200
We've seen that there are thousands of types

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.280
of customer person and each company

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.440
incorporates one or another information.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.020


00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.740
And for some it is valuable to

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.920
know what their job is and for

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.440
others not.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.220
So you have to adapt it.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.140
I think it will help you by looking

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.780
at many examples or seeing the examples

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.680
we have put today.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.080
It will inspire you.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.720
Two, you have to meet with

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.100
dozens of customers, you have

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.780
to analyze all the information

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.560
you have about customers in your

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.720
databases, in the CRM, all the

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.220
information you can.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.900
Why is?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.100
Because it can't be that the

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.000
customer person will create it with

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.920
your assumptions alone because it's

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.260
very easy that you make a lot of mistakes.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.760
This is one of the most common

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.780
mistakes, by the way.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.300
Third, we will create the different

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.140
customer person.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.760
From all that information we have

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.500
collected, we will identify

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.040
if there are one, two, three

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.280
profiles, those that are.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.080
We will be able to create them and detail

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.220
them as much as possible.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.480
And fourth, what you have to do is

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.560
that this work that is super-

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.520
value you have to bring it to the

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.340
knowledge of the entire organization.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.020
This cannot be left alone at the level

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.620
of the general management

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620
or the corresponding marketing

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.720
manager, etc.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.160
No to.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.960
It is really valuable that the entire

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.980
organization knows and understands

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.400
well what the customer person is.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.460
Because so it is much easier than

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.080
when you make decisions in your

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.820
day to day, that you often think

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.760
it has nothing to do with customers.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.220
Every decision we make should

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.820
be directed to creating

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.300
value for the customer.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.460
Therefore, I recommend that the customer

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.820
person share it with the entire

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.520
organization.
