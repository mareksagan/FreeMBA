00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.200
Before we start with the most

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.260
practical lessons, I want to share

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.900
with you a number of reflections

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.180
on how Power Launch Formula

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.160
works.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.380
Power Launch Formula is

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.040
a sequential formula that guides

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.160
you step by step in every

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.860
step you have to take to reach

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.880
Product Market Fit.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.480
So the first implication of what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.400
I said and something you have

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.300
to have is that your only goal

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.780
is to reach Product Market

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.360
Fit.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680
It has to obsess you.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.300
All you do until you reach Product

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.200
Market Fit is to look for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.640
Product Market Fit.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.560
Why is it?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.220
Because at the moment you have achieved

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.360
it, that by the way, there are very

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.680
few innovative projects that it because

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.840
they don't know how to do it, when

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.020
you do it you have a very solid

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.920
foundation on which to build.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.060
I like to compare it to the foundations.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.400
You have very solid foundations.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360
Instead, there are many people who

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.180
do not do their duties well, that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.820
what they do is jump steps and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.980
what they do is build on foundation

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.020
that is not solid.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.200
After you reach Product Market

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.760
Fit, you'll have to worry

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.900
about pushing that product,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.960
marketing, searching for channels,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.340
reaching deals, etc.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.000
But it will all be very easy because

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.740
the engine is very strong, because

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.120
your proposal fits a segment

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.940
of customers.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.000
Everything you do takes a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.720
lot of traction.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.400
Second, I want you to keep in mind that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.860
it is a step-by-step sequential formula.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.340


00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760
We have defined it so for several reasons.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.520
Here is the scheme.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.380
There are five stages and two main milestones,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.840
which are Problem Solution Fit

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.380
and then the final goal that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.640
is Product Market Fit.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.060
And why did we do it this way?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.020
Why have we defined these stages?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.640
Because it will help you, it will

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400
accompany you toward the ultimate goal

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.260
minimizing the risk.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.580
The first thing we will do is

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.360
validate the main hypotheses by

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.140
talking to customers, in a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.220
very structured way.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.800
Why talk to customers?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.820
Well, because talking to customers can

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.220
be done on the first day without investing

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.080
money.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.880
We will then do experiments

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.740
that take a little more effort

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.200
and then, when we have validated

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.680
that we have reached Problem

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.120
Solution Fit, you will have

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.480
to build the first version

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.440
of your product.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.320
But I want you to understand that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.700
it is designed so that the effort,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580
so that the investment is increasing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.400
and we can minimize the risk

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.040
in that way.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.940
That is, you will not invest until

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.660
you have validated the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.680
main hypotheses of your business

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.140
model and your value proposal.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.740
And by the way, this does almost

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.400
everyone wrong.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880
And almost everyone does what is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.740
skipping stages, what they

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.280
call prematurely climbing.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.560
And that brings you to take a lot of risks.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.260
It takes you to the picture we'

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.000
ve seen before you're building

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.260
a house on foundation that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.600
isn't solid.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.260
And the last thing I want you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.060
to know is that in this process

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.200
we are advancing in this formula

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.980
what we are doing is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.300
to increase the value a lot

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.620
while decreasing the risk.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.140
I share this photo with you.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660
I do this drawing many times.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.040
When someone has an idea, that idea

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.880
is worthless.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.680
The value is zero.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.920
The entrepreneur, the founder,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.820
the entrepreneur thinks he has

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.440
the formula of Coca-Cola.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.060
It is not worth it, nor the paper

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.120
on which we have written it.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.460
It is not worth the time spent listening

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.200
to it.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.840
It is so, that is the reality.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.080
The risk is maximum.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.400
But if you know how to apply this formula

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.980
well, if you know how to take

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.100
the first steps, what we get is very

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.660
quickly and with very little investment

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.580
to decrease that risk very much

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.740
because we are validating the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.360
hypotheses along with increasing

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.300
the value.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.600
And what we do is, as we increase

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.780
the value, you will soon be able

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.000
to go out to the market to look

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.980
for investors.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.960
If you validated the main hypotheses,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.320
yourself, because there is much

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.780
less risk, yourself, I would recommend

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.060
you leave, for example, if

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.880
you are working, you leave

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.900
your job, etc.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.380
You have to do it once you have already

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.160
validated the first possibilities.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.200
You have to do it when we have

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780
decreased the risk and increased

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.600
the value.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
And that's what we'll learn in

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.740
Power Launch Formula.
