WEBVTT

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.190
Javi, thank you very much.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.930
Thanks to you.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.930
It will be a pleasure.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.190
In this class I would like to

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.350
analyze, it is a very simple class,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.770
in which I would like to analyze

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.810
the advertising market and

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.390
for this I refer to understanding

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.890
basically what is the destination

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.310
or investments, the main advertising

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.130
investments that we make

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.190
companies in the world, understanding

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.490
or classifying a little

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.690
about how the online versus

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.110
the offline is distributed.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.750


00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.190
Within the online, for example,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.630
it would be interesting to know how

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.090
the cake is distributed within

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.890
the online, what types of platforms,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.070
what types of investments, what

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.150
types of channels, etc.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.410
Well, I think it is a bit the question

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.790
of the million, because we would

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.950
all like to know where everyone

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.850
is investing exactly, but well,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.950
I think it is worth it to also know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.350
what was before the Internet or,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.150
well, because I have been a few years

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.610
already in the world of advertising

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.530
and almost three when the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.070
Internet was beginning, because

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.450
where the companies were

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.130
destined before their advertising

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.170
investments, how they captured

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.530
or how they came to their

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410
customers, how they were able

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.070
to give their message.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.630
Then until the end we have to think

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.370
that what they had was a television,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.110
which is the great medium of coverage,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990
the way to reach the masses and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.430
give the greatest possible notoriety

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.610
to your product.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.590
We had a press that historically

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.650
has been the great medium of

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.750
credibility, where we say that

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.930
the impact was efficient as

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.910
to what it is a medium, and it

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.710
still is, very credible and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.070
that gives a great user

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.670
confidence and, therefore,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.690
was very used especially in

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.790
campaigns that needed that

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.010
reliability.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.950
And then we had the radio, which is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.610
in Spain mainly, in addition,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.370
where it is a medium so popular

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.750
and so democratic, that it is the great

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.350
medium of frequency, to repeat one

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.550
to the listener.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.910
And it was a bit of the combination

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.430
of all these media, within the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.590
press, of course, rists,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.730
etc., or print media.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.950
The combination of those media

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590
that made the advertisers

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.690
decide what was the best strategy

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.610
to follow, but with a lot

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.230
of difficulty, because they

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.730
really faced problems

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.570
of, really all this I’m investing

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.890
in, how it’s paying the investment,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.990
how I’m recovering, I’

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.030
m reaching the audience

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.990
I need to reach,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.250
etc. etc.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.450
Then, I think it comes, suddenly,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.950
appears on stage what we call

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.810
the internet and, therefore,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.350
obviously, a new channel and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.710
new advertising capabilities

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.650
to develop with this channel.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.990


00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.350
I will ask you two questions.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.190
When will it arrive?

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.950
This is not black and white, but

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.650
if you can illustrate how it

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.330
has been, it is a good idea.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.030
I think, I can tell you, in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.850
Spain, that the first campaign that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.970
is launched should be in the mid-

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.470
90s.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.190
I remember, for example, in my stage

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.530
in the country, when I arrived, I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.430
arrived much later, but, well,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.370
I remember when they commented

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.950
how the first campaign in the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.310
country was, that was with a megabanner,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.550
that is this banner that appears

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.630
on the top of the newspaper, and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.510
that was just there, it had

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.870
no type of measurement, it could

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.270
not be clicked, it didn’t take

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.130
you to any site, it just

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.270
appeared as a press announcement,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.110
but on the web, didn’

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.590
t it?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.510
So, well, imagine that...

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.790
It had no navigation.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.330
Nothing, nothing, it was just, you appeared

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.370
on the country.com and you had that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.030
impact, didn’t it?

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.190
Imagine where we’ve been

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.530
from now on, right?

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.290
That is, we started in the year,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.370
in the mid-90s, we started in 95, we

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.390
are in 2018, and it is the second

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.310
question that I was going to ask you.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.590
And today, how much does offline weigh,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.690
what is what you talk about television,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.410
press, radio, both nationally

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.790
and locally, etc.?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.470
That is the offline, and the online,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.310
that we will now analyze, but

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.970
how much does the online, press,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.550
more or less?

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.350
I know this cannot be done...

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.970
See, there are very many meters,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.830
indicators and marketing, info

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.390
adex, etc., which try to give us

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.830
some approximations.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.790
What we have clearly is that, at

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.110
the global level, the weight of the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.070
internet is increasingly growing,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.290
the progression is exponential.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.690
In the United States we already have data

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.110
where the internet, the internet

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.130
advertising investment has outpaced

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.310
the television advertising investment,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.750
which was something unthinkable

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.630
10 years ago.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.710
For us, it was a milestone

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.690
practically unattainable.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.870
Television advertising investments

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.110
are huge, the price of even

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.110
buying on television is very

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.690
high, and we thought we would never

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.650
get there and we are there

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.330
already.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.750
By giving you data from Spain, we

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.850
are estimating that digital investment

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.750
can be between 30 and 35% of the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.910
total advertising investment,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.990
but we believe that, in 2020,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.050
we can be in that 50-50 already.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.070


00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.450
We may be talking about all digital

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.410
investment being at the same

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.830
level as investing in the rest

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.030
of the media, which would be

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.890
a milestone and clearly showing

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.130
where advertisers are heading.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.150
It is undoubted.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.210
And the next thing we will

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.230
analyze is, we know the two

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.510
masses, in Spain you said

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.530
50-50 in 2020, now you said

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.050
30-35, etc.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.330
So, let’s go to the digital side.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.650
How is this cake distributed?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.990
In the digital world,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.530
we have to distinguish

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.010
between two major divisions

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.030
of the budget.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.370
On the one hand, we have a 50% that is

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.590
devoting to search, to search engines,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.130
to a non-organic positioning within

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.770
a search engine.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.790
That is, when you do a contextual

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.610
search, you put a word inside

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.270
a search engine and the result that

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.270
appears is a non-organic

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.790
result, that is, that is paid

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.730
by the advertiser, because that

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.270
is the investment we spend

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.890
in search.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.910
We, within the classification

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.910
we have made of channels,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.930
have called it SEM

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.230
search marketing?

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.310
Perfect, that’s the name, in addition,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.050
that’s the 50%.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.490
That is.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.170
Who is the player by excellence

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.830
in the search world?

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.950
Google, because really, in addition,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.970
the market share that Google

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.070
has in Spain is brutal,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.090
is above 90%.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.970
Maybe in the United States there

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.470
are other players who have added

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.550
a little bit of that cake, like

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.270
a Bing, from Microsoft,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.910
like a Yahoo.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.470
In Spain, it was Google.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.910


00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.410
The search part is also beginning

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.190
to have new ways to

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.010
monetize.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.750
Amazon has launched its

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.750
own search solution.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.070
Why is?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.090
People are looking for

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.190
products on Amazon.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.090
In fact, there is a very

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.650
high percentage of users who

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.550
use the Amazon search engine

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.490
to bring a product.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.330
And, obviously, companies are

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.690
interested in pushing for those

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.290
results.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.510
So, obviously, being years, Luz,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.270
is a new investment channel that

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.330
is pure search and that is pure

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.070
contextual.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.410
An interesting conclusion of what you

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.270
just said or an implication

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.250
of what you just said is that Amazon,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.930
today it can already be considered,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.110
that many people do not usually

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.050
ask it ever, in addition to marketplace

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.210
and commerce, is a search engine.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.990
He is a seeker.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.090
That is, we can say that users

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.850
who have an intention to buy

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.130
or who even simply

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.930
look to compare products,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.650
see the health of a product

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.430
inside because, as you know,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.410
Amazon then has a

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.730
rating, has a product

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.530
reviews, etc, etc.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.350
The user is therefore

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.910
obviously interested not only in buying

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.370
it, but in understanding the

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.570
product better, in looking for

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.290
more information.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.950
So yes, he is a searcher.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.270
Well, and as I told you, I think

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.510
there is another 50% that belongs to

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.870
the universe that we would call

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.930
display once we can part in

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.150
different investment models.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.970
We have traditional banners, because

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.710
all of those we see when we

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.630
browse the various sites.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.990
We have a very powerful investment

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.410
in video, which is one of the

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.990
digital channels that is getting

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.490
the most relevance and that is

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.670
getting the biggest investment

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.550
growth and that was previously

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.690
directly not there.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.750
So, I think there can be a certain

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.750
transfer also from those television

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.450
budgets to a format that is very

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.910
similar, that is more friendly,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.470
that is more measurable and that

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.090
is more economical also for

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.670
advertisers and, finally,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.670
of course, the entire mobile

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.290
part.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.510
What are the Infinite Players?

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.090
Just like before in search engines

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.470
we could be more limited, because

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.150
you have to have a search

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.310
engine itself, any internet

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.890
property is likely

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.130
to have a buffer, to support

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.990
advertising.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.250
We can go from the big players,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.030
from Google itself, which has

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.210
its own display network,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.070
to a Facebook, to an Amazon,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.650
to a Twitter, a Snapchat, who

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.850
are global players cross-

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.870
country, to the players who

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.570
are eminently national, each

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.890
country has its big media,

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.330
has even its own social networks,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.770
to the granularity

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.910
of the most local properties.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.590


00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.690
Spain, for example, is a very

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.130
good example of where the user

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.730
loves to have first-hand

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.190
information about their locality,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.590
their city, their town and

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.750
there is that granularity, so

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.230
the fragmentation of the investment

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.150
that occurs in these channels

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.970
is still greater.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.250
Measuring it almost one by

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.850
one is virtually impossible, so

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.390
I think we’ll get the picture that

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.950
50% goes to Search, 50% goes to

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.410
Display and we’ll see in a few

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.370
years where we are.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.870
50% Search, I want to relate it to

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.330
what we have learned in other

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.910
classes or with the nomenclature.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.550
50% Search, which is what we have

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.630
called SEM, 50% Display, which is

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.210
the rest.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.150
Within the display there are different formats,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.670
the format is that it is a banner,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.370
that it is a video or that it is a video.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.990
Mobile, that is mobile, that

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.650
are the formats, but these

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.370
three formats apply to

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.430
the different players or

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.750
the different platforms, that is,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.230
to whom you hire that space, that

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.890
are, the largest are social networks,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.310
with Facebook in the head, but

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.730
then you have clear, what I

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.850
said is a bestial atomization,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.310
because any web page that

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.650
has enough traffic can

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.550
be used to put a banner.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.810
That is, the digital entry

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.990
barrier is very small, so each

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.110
digital medium is susceptible

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.070
to support advertising, so the

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.690
fragmentation is virtually absolute.
