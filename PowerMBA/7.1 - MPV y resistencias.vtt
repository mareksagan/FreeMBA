00:00.000 --> 00:24.480
I think the benefits of going to the market with a minimum viable product and from the

00:24.480 --> 00:28.840
interactions with the customers, learning from the customers, building a product that

00:28.840 --> 00:34.000
is getting better and better, and that they are also validating it, has huge advantages

00:34.000 --> 00:39.360
over traditional development, in which from your idea you create a product, then you go

00:39.360 --> 00:42.560
to the market and in many of the occasions fail.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.560
And it is also that I do not only say it, but that people who are much smarter than us have shown it

00:48.560 --> 00:52.280
and that they have companies that grow the most in the world, such as Zapos, for example,

00:52.280 --> 00:53.280
that we saw.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.040
Therefore, it is quite obvious.

00:56.040 --> 01:02.960
However, what I also warn you is that to do it you have to break many mental structures,

01:02.960 --> 01:09.280
many mental barriers, and I would like you not to happen to you and that you will not be dragged

01:09.280 --> 01:14.440
for doing it as it has always been done, that you were able to be brave, perhaps.

01:14.440 --> 01:21.040
And I'm going to go ahead and tell you the main reasons why usually, or many entrepreneurs

01:21.200 --> 01:27.200
are not able to apply this Lean methodology and apply the concept of the minimum viable product.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.200
One of them is that they are ashamed to go to the market with a product that is not perfect,

01:32.200 --> 01:35.200
because the minimum viable product is not a perfect product.

01:35.200 --> 01:42.200
The design will not be the same as the product you have in mind, it will not work as well.

01:42.200 --> 01:48.200
And then, as I told you, they are ashamed because they have dreamed of something else, and they are

01:48.360 --> 01:53.360
entrepreneurs, they are visionaries, their first product cannot be something that they perceive

01:53.360 --> 01:57.360
to be shabby or unfinished.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.360
And also, many people, in addition to shame, what happens is that they are afraid of failure.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.360
Really, what they are afraid of, and that if you have been an entrepreneur it is very possible

02:06.360 --> 02:10.360
that it has happened to you, you are afraid of that first contact with the customers.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.360
It is something very natural and very human.

02:12.360 --> 02:17.360
Then you delay it, and then, as you are afraid, what you do is try to make sure

02:17.520 --> 02:22.520
that that first contact has greater guarantees of success.

02:22.520 --> 02:27.520
Therefore, what you do is add features that each time is the most perfect product,

02:27.520 --> 02:29.520
perfect from your point of view.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.520
But I'm sure that if you've been an entrepreneur, you understand what I'm saying.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.520
Because it's scary to go to the market with that idea you've had, with your dream,

02:39.520 --> 02:44.520
it's scary to go to the market and nothing happens of what you had in mind.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.680
So what you do is delay it, but it's a mistake.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.680
What you should do is advance it to realize it as soon as possible

02:50.680 --> 02:53.680
and to be able to pivot or iterate on your proposal.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.680
Another of the reasons that is often argued is that

03:00.680 --> 03:03.680
I don't want to damage my brand, I don't want to damage my reputation.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.680
I have to start from the beginning with something that is a client experience that is wow.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.680
Well, it's a mistake too, because to start your brand or your reputation

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
is worth nothing.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.840
It will be worth something when you are able to validate that you have a proposal

03:18.840 --> 03:20.840
that is attractive, but it's still worth nothing.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.840
So it's more important that you learn as soon as possible

03:23.840 --> 03:26.840
to think about taking care of that brand that is still non-existent,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.840
that only has value in your head.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.840
And I would also tell you that in some cases, if we get into the worst of cases

03:33.840 --> 03:38.840
and it turns out that you go to the market with something that really damages the brand,

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
what you do is change it.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
What you do is create another new brand and that's it, nothing happens.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Sometimes entrepreneurs are afraid that the clients are going to get angry,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
because this still doesn't work well.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, the reality is that it can happen, in some cases,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
it may be that the client gets angry, but you always have the opportunity to apologize.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
And also, in many occasions, those interactions allow you to get a lot of feedback from the clients.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.160
The other day I went to hire, in an application called BoxRun,

04:09.160 --> 04:14.160
I went to hire a courier service inside Madrid.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.160
And I got prices for a shipment that had to be a price of 10-15 euros,

04:18.160 --> 04:22.160
I got crazy prices, because it had been my mistake,

04:22.160 --> 04:24.160
but I thought it had been the application's mistake,

04:24.160 --> 04:26.160
I had put the postal code wrong, I don't know.

04:26.160 --> 04:32.160
Well, as I couldn't finish the process, they called me.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.320
And I realized that the founder was calling me,

04:35.320 --> 04:39.320
because of the way he addressed me, etc.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.320
Well, I didn't get angry, because that application didn't work well,

04:43.320 --> 04:48.320
on the contrary, I also thought it was very valuable

04:48.320 --> 04:51.320
that they called me, apologized, asked me, etc.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.320
Those interactions, for the entrepreneur, in this case,

04:54.320 --> 04:57.320
because he was the founder of the application,

04:57.320 --> 05:01.320
are very valuable, because they receive direct feedback from the clients.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.480
And the first thing I did when I hung up the call with them,

05:05.480 --> 05:07.480
I got back in and hired the service.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.480
Well, and finally, another fear, this is very common,

05:11.480 --> 05:13.480
I've heard it thousands of times.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.480
And it's that they don't want to go to the market

05:16.480 --> 05:18.480
with the least viable product, because they think,

05:18.480 --> 05:20.480
no, they're going to copy my idea.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.480
So what they want is to have a perfect product,

05:24.480 --> 05:26.480
and the day they go to the market,

05:26.480 --> 05:29.480
to blow up the market and be so big that no one can copy them.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.640
Well, this is stupid.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.640
It's stupid, because, to begin with,

05:34.640 --> 05:37.640
entrepreneurs usually overestimate the idea they have in their heads.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.640
What you have to do is not overestimate your idea,

05:40.640 --> 05:42.640
go to the market, that the clients tell you

05:42.640 --> 05:44.640
if what you have is powerful or not.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.640
And don't be afraid of being copied,

05:46.640 --> 05:48.640
because they can copy you at any time.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.640
They will be able to copy you anyway.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.640
If you go to the market with the finished product and you are successful,

05:53.640 --> 05:56.640
someone will notice and try to copy you.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.800
The most valuable thing is that you learn before everyone else.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.800
And if you go to the market today and you start to get

06:02.800 --> 06:04.800
very valuable information from the clients,

06:04.800 --> 06:07.800
that learning process is faster to copy.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.800
Therefore, don't overestimate your idea,

06:10.800 --> 06:12.800
don't be afraid of being copied,

06:12.800 --> 06:15.800
go to the market as soon as possible and learn as soon as possible.
