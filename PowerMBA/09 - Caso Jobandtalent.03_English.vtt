WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.700
On the other hand, we obviously have

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.260
the share of company acquisition.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.960
We do not have commercials

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.520
that will visit companies or

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.520
we have very few commercials

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.760
that will visit companies, but

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.980
we do exactly the same, we

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.100
make our platform known through

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.260
the internet to all companies.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.480
Then all that makes you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.160
have a much lower structure

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.820
and operating costs

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.220
than traditional ones.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.200
We start with the technical part of the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.540
class.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.300
What we will do is, using

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.560
the business model canvas,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.200
we will analyze the disruption

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.420
in Jovan Talent’s business

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.320
model and compare it with

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.260
the traditional models

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.280
of a temporary work

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.100
company.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.560
The first thing I want you to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.660
understand is that there are similarities.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.660
Both Jovan Talent and its

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.560
traditional competitors, the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.420
value proposition is mainly

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.020
about connecting supply

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.160
and demand for work.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.900
There are two segments of customers.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.780
On the other hand, you

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.020
have candidates who want to work

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.300
in those companies, who

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.180
are interested in those jobs.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.940
In both cases, both models generate

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.240
variable income by intermediation

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960
in this type of operations.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.300
But we will analyze, from what

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.780
Felix has told us, how the model

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.300
of his competitors of a traditional

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.200
temporary work company is.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.540
Felix advanced us on what the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240
ETT proposal consists of or what

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.740
it is.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.020
The value proposal of an ETT

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.780
is mainly based on the people

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.360
they offer in the ETT employees,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.300
who offer advice and establish

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.380
one-to-one relationships

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.660
between the ETT employees

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.080
and the two customer

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.100
segments, companies

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.080
and candidates.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760
On the part of companies, the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760
ETT has to have sellers,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.160
with commercials that capture

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.280
those companies and in addition

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.640
to service the candidates

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120
need offices.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.000
Therefore, the ETT has to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.880
have an Y all this has huge

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.680
implications in terms of resources

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.720
and in terms of costs.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.260
As we can see, we have put the same

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.620
thing in the key resource section

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.700
as in the costs.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.360
A large staff and a

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.060
network of offices

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.700
covering the entire

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.360
national geography.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.080
Well, because from this photo, which

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.620
we have described very well the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.840
business model of an ETT, we will

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.640
go to see what the innovations

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120
generated by Jovan Talent have been.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.320
And let’s start with the first thing

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.120
Felix has told us and he has talked

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.060
about technology.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.480
Well, Jovan Talent instead of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.680
relying on people and offices on

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.880
this type of assets, rely on a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.020
completely different asset that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.100
is a technology platform that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.620
connects supply and demand.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.740
Therefore, we are already establishing

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.380
personal relationships between

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140
ETT employees and the two customer

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.340
segments, but digital relationships

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.000
are established, as we

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.080
see here.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.780
This also generates a greater value

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.240
in terms of immediate, as

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.580
far as fast matching is concerned,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.540
because the platform is very

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.040
efficient connecting the two

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.680
customer segments.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.740
Moreover, Felix told us, we

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.720
are clearly not in need

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.840
of offices, we do not need sellers.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.920
Jovan Talent does not need

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.740
offices or sellers to connect

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.280
or establish relationships

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.300
with its customers.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.220
Everything is digital, everything is online.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.660
The capture strategy, for example,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.780
is done through online

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.660
marketing.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.280
Well, all that has a impact, in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.280
that the costs are much lower,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.200
because the structure is

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.300
much lighter.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.920
Let us summarize.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.440
In three main values, innovation

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.380
generated by Jovan Talent.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.820
One, it offers more value to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.680
customers thanks to immediate.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.520
The platform, as we said, is very

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.100
efficient by connecting very quickly

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.500
and agile to the supply and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.200
demand of work.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.140
Much more than people who

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.880
work in an ETT.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.880
In addition, being a lighter company,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.440
which does not depend on

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.020
sellers or offices, is much

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.960
more scalable.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.680
It can grow much faster.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.540
And as Felix told us, they also

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.420
have a competitive advantage

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.600
over ETTs, because their

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.220
costs are much lower.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.620
And they can offer a cheaper

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.640
rate than a traditional ETT.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.260
Well, and to finish, what we will

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.660
do from Power Envié is to congratulate

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.720
the three artists of Jovan

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.320
Talent’s success, Félix Ruiz,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.740
Juan Nurdíales and Felipe Navío,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.600
who, despite having gone very

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.420
badly, have known how to overcome

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.780
very complicated circumstances,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.240
have known how to pivot and evolve

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.460
their business model.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.280
And they are currently in an

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.300
upward phase, in which they will

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.340
clearly become the sector of

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.400
temporary work, both in Spain

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.380
and in all the markets in which

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.620
they are present.
