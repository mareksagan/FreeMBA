WEBVTT

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.300
Jordi, we will talk about a topic

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.100
that seems to me to be exciting

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.420
and to many people it generates

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.860
curiosity and is the exit.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400
It’s that moment when the founders

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.960
of a startup or a company sell

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.180
it and I would like to ask

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.140
you a series of questions.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.180
First, tell us a little

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.400
about your case.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220
My case is the case of a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.660
co-founder of a technology-based

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.720
company, of an internet company

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.460
and is a bit of the paradigmatic case.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.640
Well, we were two original

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.440
founders with our savings, we set

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.640
up a company in a garage, we raised

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.280
capital money from the...

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.960
What years were you?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.320
He was 33 years old at that

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.820
time.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.720
And we went through an accelerator

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.320
called Sea Rocket, we raised money

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.520
from Business Angels and risk

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.960
capital in several rounds and just

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.460
a year ago, eight years after having

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.320
mounted the company, the majority

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.220
of Habitísimo’s capital has been

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.740
sold, in this case to another company

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.160
and the founding team still

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.540
remains in the company and Habitísimo

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.680
today, we are 250 people in the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.420
team and operating in nine

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.620
different countries in the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.180
world.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.380
Then we started two and we brought

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260
the company with the help of investors

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.400
and the entire team to this

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.560
state.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.180
It is the paradigmatic case of success,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.940
that is, company that is growing,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.240
that investors accompany you, that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.940
you end up leaving in a period

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.440
of eight years and also you stay

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.620
with part of the company, etc.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.060
And I’ll go ask you a few questions

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940
not just about your particular

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.360
case, but about what is usually

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.860
the case.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.100
well is.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.720
To understand how these operations

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.560
or success work.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.120
What are the most common types

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.380
of success, the types of comparisons?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.440


00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.540
It is worth, then, to see, when one mount

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.100
a company as an entrepreneur has to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100
know what he wants to do with it,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.080
what is his goal and if he will be

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.900
all his life because it is his vital

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.380
personal project and can do it alone,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.820
for example, or accompanied

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.040
by another partner, or if he will

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.220
require, for example, investors.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.140
So if you need investors, then

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.620
you have to have planned

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.940
that those investors will want

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.720
to leave the company at

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.820
some point because investors

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.160
invest to get a return on

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.220
their investment.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.220
That is something that needs to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.800
be clear.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.060
Investor will not have to say that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.780
there will have to be a success or a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.260
departure from those investors and in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.700
that success because the founding

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880
team can also go out or not.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.980
You can take the company to stock, that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.080
would be a case, but it is very uncommon

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.780
because you have to have taken

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.880
the company a already considerable

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.900
size and the most common success

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.320
is that the company is sold

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.060
to a third party.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.280
And that third, to simplify it, there

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.920
are two types of buyers.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.500
A financial buyer who sees it as an

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.720
investment and wants to continue growing

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.040
and then only sell it again

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.920
and an industrial buyer who would

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.620
be another company similar to yours

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.260
that probably operates in the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.440
same sector, where you get synergies

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.200
with your product or

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.780
service and who is about

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.180
to stay all life in that project.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.440
Yes, like the industrial buyer, for example,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.040
if you have a marketplace in

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.600
Spain and it is seen as the red

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.920
black, a larger competitor,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.940
a European player, worldwide or whatever,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.960
comes to buy you because you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.600
are a black.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.480
Exactly, but there may be a competitor,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.240
who probably did not compete in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.960
your country, but from another market

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.540
that wants to be implanted in your

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.700
market or can be, in our case,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.660
an industrial company.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.480
That is, it was a company that

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.640
operated in our sector but with another

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.000
value proposal, more offline,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.440
more traditional and that saw in

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.820
us a way to innovate and to open

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.440
another source of income and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.160
business opportunities for

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.840
that project.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.520
In my case, he was an

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.820
industrial buyer.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.960
Basically, the difference is industrial,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.040
it is someone in your sector,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.520
be it global, local, direct

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.000
competitor, another value proposal,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.560
etc.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.840
The financial is a fund, companies

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.340
that have a diversified portfolio

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.780
of investments but are not

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.600
in your sector.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.700
Usually, the buyer usually acquires

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.220
100%, usually acquires

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.640
a part.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.200
How is the structure of the operation

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.660
usually?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.700
There is no single recipe

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.040
that works for all cases.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.280
Each case and each sector is

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.240
different because it will depend much

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.660
on the situation of the buyer, the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.900
situation of the seller, the situation

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.660
of the founding team, the market

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.560
and others.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.280
But normally, what I think happens

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.560
is that buyers want the founding

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.140
team to be a while because

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.260
that first gives them more assurances

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.960
and more confidence

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.420
that the project will go on

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.440
the right track.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.420
But, for example, it’s not the same thing to buy.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.620
We are talking about the purchase

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.500
of a company that has gone well, which

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.300
can be different from buying a company

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.580
that goes wrong or because it is

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.100
back or because there are assets

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.880
and others.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.940
But in the case we are talking

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.880
about here, it’s a company that’s going

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.740
well.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820
The buyer always has a certain fear

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.200
that what he is buying is what

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.060
he has been told, what it seems

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.660
to be.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.040
So if the management team, the founding

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.780
team, still keeps on for a while,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.340
I think that’s a good sign

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.240
that the team is believing in

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.640
that long-term project and that

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.380
commitment and that there won’

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.140
t be too much disruption in

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.260
the day-to-day operations.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.240
and perfect.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.240
But it has all the sense of the world,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.800
right?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.320
and exact.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.560
So, they often ask that you be a time

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.400
and there are some clauses for

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.260
that you be a certain time.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.180
Usually, this time is linked to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.680
a prize.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.340
In that purchase-sale operation,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.220
it has probably been agreed that

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.200
it will be bought at 100%, but now

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.240
only one part is paid and there is

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040
another part that will be paid in

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.340
equal time and maybe the price

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.860
of that second part can depend

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.240
on a few goals to.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.060
That varies a little.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.600
and exact.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.820
There are also a thousand models and

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.500
you would have to talk to an expert on

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.080
this type of transactions to get into

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.540
detail.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.060
I am not an expert in that.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.400
What happens sometimes is that

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.400
the entrepreneur, for example,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.340
also, simplifies everything and

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.560
makes a little caricature,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.200
but the entrepreneur doesn’t usually

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.540
be a manager or a manager.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.020
He is a businessman who doesn’t

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.180
like to have a boss.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.020
So what happens sometimes is that when

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.820
you have sold the company and you are

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.780
in a structure a little bigger, more

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.200
dumb than grateful, with someone

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.560
to report, because that entrepreneur

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.520
no longer feels as comfortable

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.660
as before and can no longer

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.440
do as before what they were

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.580
giving him the pleasure.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.380
Yes, yes yes yes

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.060
There may be a little tension.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.860
There are cases, in fact, that this

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.340
is to be understood well, because

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.060
effectively the entrepreneur is not

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.620
a manager.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.360
The entrepreneur has other...

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.880
Usually there are people who know

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.720
how to reconvert, but

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.080
usually the competences are very

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.880
different.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.600
and exact.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.560
He is a missionary, he is an impulsive

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.180
uncle, he is a uncle...

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.780
And it has also made this company

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.760
grow from scratch.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.720
Then one day they buy it and

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.780
then they put some bosses on it.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.280
And people take it very badly.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.920
And there are cases where there are

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.100
people who even go ahead of time

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.580
losing a bunch of millions because...

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.420
Because he is no longer happy.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.000
But then there’s also no single

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.300
recipe here, because it

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.560
will depend a lot on the end

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.120
if you really integrate into

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.560
a larger structure or continue

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.660
to operate at least as

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.740
a separate unit.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.040
So, there may be...

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.800
There is no single case that describes everything.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.440
and yes.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.480
But it’s good what you’ve told and the

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.660
anecdote because it’s a reality that

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.700
happens.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.280
Tell us briefly what the process,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.640
the sales process of your company is.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.380
Well then...

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.680
The process begins by...

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.340
I think that companies

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.040
buy or sell.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.940
Then the process begins with

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.600
a buyer’s show of interest in

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.160
what you’re doing.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.100
That said, I think it’s important

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.440
for any entrepreneur, for any

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.080
entrepreneur, to always be working

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.820
relationships or building

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.340
relationships and contacts

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.600
with potential buyers

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.580
from day to day.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.420
Financial, industrial, competitors

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.800
in other countries, in the

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.900
entire market.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.840
But it all starts because someday someone

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.020
is knocking on your door and

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.400
saying they are interested in

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.720
buying you.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160
You can do this yourself

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.760
or you can do it

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.220
with a...

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.420
In other words, a company that

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.520
helps you with this process.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.920
It is usually recommended to have a broker

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.120
who will help you through the whole

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.300
process because you are not

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.440
an expert in that and that broker

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.560
will help you.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.560
This broker will excel a

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.380
process schedule.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.600
You can also try to get another

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.940
competition to that buyer.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.840
Competition is good because it

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.180
can improve the conditions for the

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.980
seller.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.200
And the stake of this is that

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.040
that broker again charges a

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.720
percentage or fee of the transaction.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.840
There’s a retainer that’s called, which

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.980
is like a fixed one to cover your expenses

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.840
and minimum, and then joins a percentage

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.140
to success.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.640
These are respectable figures, so sometimes

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.760
you have to negotiate well.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.400
Then this purchase process begins

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.160
with a letter of intent

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.400
where the buyer says we are

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.620
interested in acquiring this

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.900
company more or less in these

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.900
general lines and we will

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.420
enter a period called

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.380
due diligence.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.720
Due diligence basically consists in

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.220
that that buyer will want to check

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.860
with auditors and with professionals

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.300
that what you have told

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.780
him is true.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.900
He will take up all the carpets,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.300
he will look at all the books, to

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.680
see that what one says is true.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.480
This process is very difficult because

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.240
it usually takes months.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.120
And it is hard because it requires

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.260
a high workload, reporting, meeting,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.420
explaining things, and in parallel

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.340
you have to continue to get the

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.960
business day by day and also you

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.740
have to try to get that if

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.880
you had a business plan that is

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.700
to go to fulfill that because

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.500
if you do not comply that because

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.820
somehow you lose credibility

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.520
during this process.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.140
And the value of the company, in

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.120
the end the value may have been

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.580
impacted and if you are not bought,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.920
the operation is not closed.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.920
This happens many times and it has happened

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.560
to us.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.020
We have been in three processes

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.800
of these and it has been the third

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.720
ball defeated, but before we

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.860
have had two processes failed.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.640
They are weakened.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.240
They are intense, but if one takes

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.980
it as a source of learning after

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.740
that process we have been a better

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.180
company and we have been better

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.980
entrepreneurs.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.320
At the end of this process is

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.780
the transaction.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.940
If everything is well, it is signed

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.880
a day before a notary and celebrated,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.900
try to celebrate it In our case

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.920
we have not celebrated

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.360
too much and the next day

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.060
we went back to work.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.980
Recommended in all that is to have

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.660
a very good lawyer because they

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.720
are complex issues and also a good

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.540
tax officer because the part

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.140
of taxes and tax are usually very relevant.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.800
As I said, I have some advice to summarize.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.360
The broker, go working always in relationships

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.200
as an entrepreneur, the broker,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.440
the lawyer, the prosecutor.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.820
The prosecutor at the personal level.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.020
At a personal level.
