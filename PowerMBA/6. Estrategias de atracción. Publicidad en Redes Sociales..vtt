00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.130
Javi, I would like to analyze how

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.810
display advertising works

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.350
on the Internet.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.370
So what I am going to do is...

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.430
I will ask you a few questions.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.010
First, who is involved in this?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.050
Who are the players?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.090
I think the two main actors

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.690
are clear.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.650
On the one hand, we have an advertiser,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.850
which is the part of the purchase.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.150
It is someone who seeks to buy

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.250
a advertising space to a certain

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430
target that has been marked.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.690
And, on the other hand, we have on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.950
other side the part of the sale, which

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.410
are the supports.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.810
Who are the digital supports?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.810
I think the fragmentation is

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.290
infinite.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.410
Any property is the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.630
property of the Internet.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.150
Call it a blog, call it a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.830
mobile app, which has an inventory

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.390
available to those advertisers.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.830
What is the inventory?

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.370
We would say too.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.790
The inventory, by definition, is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.510
the entire space that can receive

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.050
an impact advertising.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.410
That is, those blank spaces that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.150
have to be filled by the advertiser

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.130
to unfold their message or

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.410
paint their message to the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.370
user.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.450
The inventory would be...

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.310
We are entering an online era.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.050
And the inventory is the spaces

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.930
that have up, down, wherever

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.370
it is.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.690
Or initially...

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.610
Inventory is the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.010
volume of spaces

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.590
that are able

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.690
to offer you in

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.030
a given time.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.930
And they sell it to me, who am the advertiser.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.530
To make the advertising impact.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
It is also important that we know

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.830
that there are other actors within

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.750
this equation, such as meters.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.010
In Spain, the only measurement

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.630
certified by the IAB, which is the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.910
regulatory body of all digital

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150
advertising, is Comscore.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350
Comscore basically does what it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.790
does is measure the traffic of each

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.990
of those internet properties so

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.150
that it publicly offers us that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.230
traffic information.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.830
Traffic is basically the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.250
volume of traffic impressions

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.850
that each of those properties has.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.210
We also measure this in

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.930
single users.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.530
That is, Comscore tells us what

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.710
is amongst many metrics that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.650
gives us is how many unique users

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.490
have interacted with that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.530
property in a month.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.410
The country has had 20 million

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.930
unique users in the world,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.230
21 brand, 12, etc.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.490
Then it brings transparency because

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.190
when you hire a campaign in the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.770
country you already have that information

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.170
certified, right?

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.830
Evidently, because at the end

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.410
of the day, obviously, each of those

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.530
properties measures internally

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.810
what volumes they handle,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.910
but we always need a certificator

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.850
that homogenizes the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.410
data and publishes it in a public

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.610
and certain way with a few

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.550
standards behind which are

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.830
measured and that gives

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.450
that reliability to the market

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.610
that everyone needs.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.330
To end the players we have said that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.230
there are some advertisers, the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.510
companies we are investing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.930
in advertising and that what we

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.210
do is buy supports, that

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.590
is the other of the players,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.550
that are the publishers, the owners

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.570
of an application, a web page,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.790
a blog, whatever, and you have

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.130
also talked to us about the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.810
certificators that in all

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.010
this provide transparency.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.030
The next question I'll ask you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.910
is how is this contracted?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.030
I am the advertiser, you have already

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.130
told me there are some supports,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.350
but what do I do?

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.150
I think the way to hire is very

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.450
varied but we could again clear

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.270
it out in two large blocks.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.970
There may be a manual contract.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.530
Manual hiring is a typical,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.770
prototypical hiring of how the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.630
entire life has been done to

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.710
hire the police officer.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.910
Just like someone before wanted

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.550
to hire a page in a newspaper

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.890
and you went to the newspaper paid

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.190
for your page and gave you that space,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.870
because on the internet we

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.290
can basically do the same thing.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.110
You can have a direct relationship

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.670
with that support, that is, you hear,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.750
I'm interested in hiring this

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.110
volume of your inventory in a

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.050
certain time and negotiated at

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.250
a certain price, right?

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.650
Is it always the advertiser who

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.110
goes to the support?

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.930
No to.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.450
In Spain and around the world,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.490
advertising is very

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.770
intermediate, practically 90% of

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.850
advertising is intermediate but

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.110
simply for an efficiency issue,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.730
right?

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.010
There are players that are

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.450
media agencies and media purchasing

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.050
agencies that basically

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.650
do is negotiate with those

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.770
supports both what spaces are

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.210
the ones they will hire as the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.630
price at which they will hire

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.750
and then the advertiser who

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.170
is your customer transfer what

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.830
is the best of the options translated

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.390
into what we could call

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.890
a medium plan, not a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.630
media plan.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.410
Why is it?

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.470
Because imagine with the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.870
fragmentation that has the internet,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.690
with how poor the entry barrier

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.550
or the low that is the internet

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.490
entry barrier and the multitude

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.470
of players there, if a single advertiser,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.410
a Danone Mr, had to sit with

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.270
all and each of the owners of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.830
an internet property to negotiate

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.510
a campaign, it would be

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.550
absolutely unavailable,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.470
it would be inefficient and

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.350
also probably would hire there

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.410
where the results will

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.910
not necessarily accompany

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.150
you in the best way and that

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.250
is a job that agencies

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.650
cover in a basic way

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.670
for this business.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.330
So manually you can do it directly,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.630
you can do it through an agency

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.530
and then finally we have the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.450
automation of these processes, let's

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.810
say that it is the whole

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.550
part of programmatic advertising

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.570
that is what is in everyone's

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.710
mouth in the last few years

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.530
and that I think it's worth

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.510
deepening into a later class

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.050
in everything that involves,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.870
how it is handled and what

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.750
are the actors of this type

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.050
of advertising.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.490
Well, you have told that, manual

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.470
that is between people

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.010
or automatic, in the manual we can

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.490
directly contact with that publisher,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.630
because imagine we call the expansion

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.930
and send us a powerpoint

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.270
or a pdf with the space,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.810
etc., with different prices,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.290
we decided that it is not efficient

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.670
this and if you have a huge

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.770
budget and you want to go out

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.610
on a lot of sites, as you

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.730
said Mr. Danone, because it

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:39.950
is impossible to manage

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.850
all that.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.390
There are people who can help you,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.030
who have the relationship with

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.810
all publishers, who advise you,

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.110
make a medium plan, etc. or we have

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.170
the automated form through programming

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.490
networks, platforms that

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.910
you will tell us in detail

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.670
how it works.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.610
The next question is,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.590
regardless of whether we do it

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.670
one way or another, how is it paid?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.090
Well, there are a multitude of ways,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.890
that is, we can go again the

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.250
most traditional way, because

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.330
just like we put before the

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.410
example of going and hiring

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.470
a page of a newspaper and that

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.870
the page of the newspaper costs

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.810
me 5,000 euros, because I can

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.750
do a model that we call more

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.230
sponsorship, that is, I want

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.130
to have my space in a fixed

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.630
way during this temporary

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.170
window in this specific space

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.450
and what we call a fixed

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.730
cost, because this costs

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.650
5,000 or costs 10,000.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.970
Anything on the day.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.730
Effectively, a trade is a cost,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.210
a cost price and then what we

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.710
can do is go to variable prices

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.470
that can be fixed too, but let's

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.890
say we enter models like the

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.630
CPM, which is the cost per thousand,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.290
because for every thousand impressions

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.230
that the publisher offers, every

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.570
thousand impacts, because it has

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.830
a certain cost, we can go

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.230
to a cost per click, exclusively

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.390
when they click on my creativity,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.130
a cost of CPA, which is a

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.410
cost per acquisition,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.350
a cost per lead, which is

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.670
every time a form is filled,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.550
information is asked, etc.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.670
These are a bit, say, the

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.110
variation of costs that exist

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.350
in the hiring models that exist

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.870
on the internet today.
