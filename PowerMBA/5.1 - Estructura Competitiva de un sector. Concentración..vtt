00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.370
NÃ©stor, how is the structure of the

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.490
sector from the perspective of the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.030
concentration and fragmentation of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.470
the different players?

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.210
It is a sector, although it does not

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.110
seem to the general consumer, it

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.030
is a sector that is enormously fragmented.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.610
The players, at the global level,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.910
do not have very large market accounts.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.410
The Big ones?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.690
The big even, now we will talk,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.130
we can give, for example, the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.490
market of your accessory,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.810
we are talking about the fashion

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.450
market, at the global level

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.390
we are talking about billions of euros,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.990
it is an astronomical figure and,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.670
for example, Inditex, which

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.230
is the leader, sells 23.000,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.250
this is a 1.5% and this is the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.710
leader.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.870
I am convinced that if

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.170
we ask people, anyone who

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.090
is not in the sector, who is not

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.970
an expert in the sector like you,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.090
what is the percentage, the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.730
market share of a competitor

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.490
like Inditex?

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.010
They say something very high.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.350
Sure they tell you the 15, the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.970
20, mostly depends on what geographic

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.210
area of the world, because the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.350
world is very large, you ask, but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.070
look, Inditex sells $23 billion,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.490
the second player is HIM, around

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.410
$21 billion invoice, then you

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.090
have Fast Retailing, which

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.430
is Uniclaw, the most relevant

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.670
brand that people know

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.290
is Uniclaw, which

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.630
is around $17 billion.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.530
Yes, Uniclaw is a beast, they are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.110
Japanese and it is a beast in Asia,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.990
then you have GAP, which was

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.870
advanced by Uniclaw recently,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.270
around 16,000, it is that you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.770
sum these and you are talking, that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.510
they are say the biggest, you are

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.470
talking about a market share

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.830
around 4%, and the pragmas of this

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.850
world, which is now growing a lot,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.770
I mention it because it is a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.430
slightly different model, are at

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.090
6.000, 7.000 billion, with which

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.450
it is a market that is not

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.650
anything consolidated,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.450
although in recent years there

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.430
is a certain tension of margins

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.750
and therefore a consolidation

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.970
of the market, it is still

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.610
a very fragmented market.
