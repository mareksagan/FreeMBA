You said before that it's impossible to have only successes, and you gave an example, but

00:14.000 --> 00:20.800
the reality is that you have shown an exceptional sense of smell, because there are very few

00:20.800 --> 00:27.400
projects that succeed over projects that fail, and you have been lucky, but not probably

00:27.400 --> 00:30.400
to have several of the great successes.

00:30.400 --> 00:35.900
So I would like very much, I think it is very enriching if you tell us, what do you look at,

00:35.900 --> 00:41.400
how do you analyze a company, what do you look at, whether they are metric people, I don't know,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.400
to invest or not to invest?

00:43.400 --> 00:53.200
Well, depending on the stage of the business, I look at some variables or others, that is,

00:53.200 --> 01:00.200
in a company that you are going to set up from the beginning, obviously there are no metrics,

01:00.200 --> 01:07.200
I look at whether there is capacity for the market, so that it is a model, a big business,

01:07.200 --> 01:12.200
then on the other hand I look at a lot...

01:12.200 --> 01:14.200
I'm going to do a review, size of market.

01:14.200 --> 01:20.200
Size of market, fundamental, at least for me, and it is what helps me to know if such.

01:20.200 --> 01:29.200
The idea, the business that wants to be set up, is creating a real added value?

01:29.200 --> 01:32.200
That is, is there a real competitive advantage?

01:32.200 --> 01:39.200
That is, are there some deficiencies in that sector in which you want to set it up that you can cover

01:39.200 --> 01:46.200
doing it better, with much less resources than your competitors, because they are much bigger?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.200
Yes or no?

01:48.200 --> 01:57.200
If the answer is yes at that moment in ascending, it is when what I do is try to surround myself with the best team,

01:57.200 --> 02:04.200
and in the end that choice is what is going to mark your company.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.200
Then there is another thing that is also fundamental, that I always consider, it is the timing.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.200
I'm going to give a simple example so you can see it clearly.

02:12.200 --> 02:18.200
If Twenty instead of being set up in 2004, when Facebook had not yet arrived in Spain,

02:18.200 --> 02:26.200
if it had been set up in 2008, I don't know for sure, but I can assure you that probably in a very high percentage

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
it would not have been successful.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.200
So timing is also fundamental.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.200
I love it because you have said four factors that are key.

02:36.200 --> 02:42.200
Size of the market, creation of value, because there is a problem that has not yet been solved.

02:42.200 --> 02:48.200
And also, not only that it solves a problem, but that it solves a problem with certain competitive advantages,

02:48.200 --> 02:52.200
in a more efficient way than the current solutions or whatever.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.200
We have said team, the third leg, and the fourth you have said timing.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.200
I think it is a good summary of the four factors to analyze.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
Thank you.
