00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.670
Javi, you told us a little about

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.010
the trend, which is obvious all we

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.210
are seeing, that online advertising

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.730
expenditure is growing versus

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.270
offline.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.510
So what I would like is that we have

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.930
a very quick, brief analysis of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.150
what they are, what it offers

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.030
or what are the advantages,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.130
which will also have disadvantages,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.990
but what are the advantages

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.350
of opting for online media.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390
I think the advantages are clear,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.150
that is, we have gone through

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.210
the ones we have lived offline

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.210
and I have worked, we

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.990
had clear problems identifying

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.910
what our target target

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.190
was, how we could measure,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.310
what was the return on

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.110
the investment we

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.670
were having.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670
So, without taking away the part

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.490
of support for conversion that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.790
the offline media have, because

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.330
the notoriety, the frequency

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.770
they offer is important

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.010
for digital conversion, I think

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.650
that the online advantages

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.050
they offer is, on the one hand

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.650
targeting, that is, we are able

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950
to know who we want to address

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.410
and impact only those to

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.470
whom we are interested to impact

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.910
in such a way that we

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.230
gain a brutal efficiency

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.990
and effectiveness of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.370
the brutal campaigns.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.270
On the other hand, optimization,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.630
that is, knowing in real time what

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870
is happening because I can measure

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.950
what is happening and therefore

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.650
I can make real-time decisions

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.930
so that the result I want to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.030
get is much more efficient too.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.410
You do a television campaign to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.890
start segmentation as the targeting

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.070
you said, because well, because

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.750
by schedule and by program and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.810
then a 15 day campaign and from

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.610
it starts until it ends what you

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.690
have to do is cross your fingers

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.510
so that you have hit, you can'

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.070
t change anything about the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.350
march, you can't optimize.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090
That is, it's true that you can see

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.550
certain I have a campaign on

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.730
TV and suddenly I see more traffic

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.170
on my website.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.250
You can't stop it at that moment,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.890
that's what I say.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.470
Effectively, but in the end you have

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.510
hired some GRPs at a certain cost

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.070
that does not vary, you can not

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.330
make decisions in real time, if you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.610
are seeing something you don't

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.910
like don't give it a button and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.250
stop it.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.850
In digital you have all those

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.270
options and also you have a very important

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.230
layer that is the whole part of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.070
the report, that is, once not only

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.290
in the middle of the campaign to make

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.330
those optimization decisions,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.510
but once it is over, you collect

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.730
a lot of metrics, from the most

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.210
basic that is a advertising impression,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.390
how many times this impact has

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.350
been shown to my user, to the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.950
conversion it has had,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.590
to the clicks that have been

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.650
made on my creativities, to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.830
the type of audience

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.710
I have interacted with.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.790
More or less you learn.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.470
Then you learn more and learn a lot

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.570
of things that you can apply

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.590
not only to your digital campaigns,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.270
but to the entire universe of campaigns,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.670
to your media mix, even offline,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.190
that you can do.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370
Even the company's own strategy,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.890
because you may find that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.250
your customer person is not

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.210
what you thought.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.910
actually is.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.030
It's true that, I always say the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.630
same thing, when customers come

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.170
and talk to us, regardless

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.330
of the medium in which we are, and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.010
they tell you, this is my target

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.190
audience, we make recommendations

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.370
of which we believe can be their

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.470
target audience, and many times

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.830
it surprises us that the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.450
top performer is a third

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.050
party we had never considered.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.190
That insight is almost impossible to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.050
have in an offline campaign and through

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.690
the digital universe what you have is gold,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.430
it is an added value to everything you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.990
have done, to everything and your product,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.330
and to how you direct it to your

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.750
final audience, which is brutal.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.010
One, targeting, segmentation, two

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.590
you said optimization and three

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.930
you said learning.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.470
That is.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.810
And I would finally leave, although

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.070
it sounds a little worse to

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.850
say, obviously it's a cost issue too.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.430
Making a television campaign, doing

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.070
a press campaign, doing a radio

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.090
campaign, regardless

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.510
of the metric you want to measure,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.110
is always more expensive than

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.470
doing a digital campaign.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.470
Not just by the cost of the campaign

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.890
itself, but by its efficiency.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.230


00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.690
That is, in the end, depending on

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.590
how we want to value it, the cost

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.690
efficiency will always be

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.350
much lower in digital than that

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.250
that will be in a campaign.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.810
I would add the minimum investment

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.110
needed and would add immediate, because

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.190
if I want to do a television campaign

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.570
I have to hire an agency, think

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.990
everything, it's a lot of mess.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.350
If I want to start using SEM, I

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.450
put myself, even if I have no idea,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.990
I see a tutorial, in half an

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.050
hour I have ads posted.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.330
That is, one of the great advantages,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.430
for example, is that the access

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.370
to self-service has been greatly encouraged.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.410
That is, anyone from their home with

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.450
a credit card can access a self-

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.350
service platform from

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.410
any medium, practically, and start

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.790
to be able to do campaigns without

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.370
the need to intermediate

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.290
with anyone.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.290
So, in the end, it may not be

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.490
the most efficient always, but

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.470
it's definitely instant and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.710
you can do it yourself at any time.
