00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.860
The digital marketing

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.560
test has 20 questions

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.720
and 25 correct answers.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.260
I’m sure there are many

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.500
answers that are eliminatory.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.780
What are the benefits of inbound

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.540
marketing?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.540
It is important to understand the

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.300
difference between inbound and outbound.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.340
Inbound marketing has many benefits.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.520
We do not pay

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.260
for traffic.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.640
Is it more stable and sustainable?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.140


00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.900
Once you have had success

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.880
in an inbound marketing

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.260
strategy, imagine, then

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.620
a content marketing strategy

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.660
or SEO, etc.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.880
You will generate traffic in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.260
a sustainable way.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.680
And the conversion of leads and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.740
visits is higher too, because keep

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.200
in mind that the inbound, as you are

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.220
attracting with interesting content,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.900
the quality of traffic

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.620
is higher.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.140
The wrong answer in

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.560
this case is this.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.760
Inbound marketing does not have a higher

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.060
return in the short term.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.820
In fact, inbound marketing you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.320
have to be aware that the main

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.160
disadvantage is that it is a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.380
more medium-term strategy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.980
Is Inbound Marketing more customer-centric?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.760
Yes, it is more client-centered.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.020
You have in mind that outbound

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.140
marketing, which is traditional

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.280
advertising, we do what we

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.980
do is impact you through different

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.160
supports at different times,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.860
etc.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.840
Instead, in the inbound what we

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.420
do is attract you with content that

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.460
interests you.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.490
Is content marketing an inbound

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.650
marketing strategy?

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.110
Is Inbound Marketing Free?

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.890
No to.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.510
What happens with inbound marketing

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.310
is that we don’t pay directly

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.650
for that traffic, but we have to

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.690
invest, because we have to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.250
have dedicated staff, generate

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.310
content, videos, texts,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.310
blogs, etc., because it has

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.030
a cost.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.990
After all, we have to invest

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.150
in inbound marketing.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.500
What is the highest quality

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.640
traffic?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.560
It regenerates a higher conversion

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.180
ratio because you are attracting

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.220
traffic or people who are more

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.440
aligned with your value proposal,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.660
etc., so they will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.680
buy more.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.840
And the average ticket is higher, or the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.560
customer lifetime value, that is,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.220
they will be spent more per person.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.520
In fact, both are correct.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.990
One of the goals or benefits

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.790
of a traffic attraction strategy

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.830
is to generate awareness or

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.530
branding, to know us or

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.490
to promote the brand, etc.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.790
It is common sense,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.530
right?

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.070
If you are attracting visitors to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.410
your website or you are getting

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.750
your ads to impress a lot of people,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.890
well, you are actually generating

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.690
brand, aren’t you?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.250
Although you can then convert

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.130
or not, that maybe conversion

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.310
is the main goal we have to have,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.010
but what is clear is that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.230
we contribute positively

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.850
to the brand.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.110
What are the main levers

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.770
in traffic generation or

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.330
attraction strategies?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.250
Volume, cost per visit, quality of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.550
traffic, all the previous ones.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.850
The correct answer is all the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.010
previous ones.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.490
The levers, after all, are to generate

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.330
more traffic at a lower cost and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.910
that it is of higher quality.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.220
Display campaigns can be hired.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.040
What options do we have?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.600
We can hire it directly

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.220
with support, we agree

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.300
with the medium, through agencies

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.780
and through programming

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.840
platforms.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.320
All three answers are correct.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.380
The advantages in social media

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.800
advertising, social media

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.460
marketing over SEM, if we make

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.000
a comparison, what are they?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.080
We go one by one.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.680
It allows us to do more

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.780
tracking along the funnel.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.640
Social media has the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.320
benefits that can impact

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.860
them.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.080
Many times you can condition it based

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.520
on whether they have visited

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.900
us, not visited us, that they

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.960
have left us the data and it is

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.820
a lead, that they have bought, etc.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.480
You can do a good job on a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.180
social network.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.440
The bidirectionality is greater, clearly.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.550
We can put more enriched ads.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.690
Yes, it allows us many different

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.450
formats, carousels, photos, texts,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.310
everything.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.890
The segmentation is also greater.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.390
Social media allows you to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.730
segment a lot, for example, think

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.650
on LinkedIn.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.210
You can do a professional segmentation

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.750
with very detailed, depending

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.170
on the type of work, the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.370
company you work in, etc.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.550
Thus, they are all correct.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.390
The main disadvantage of advertising

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.690
on social media is that you

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.030
have to face a considerable

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.770
minimum investment.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.690
This is false, because in social

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.230
networks, platforms like Twitter,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.730
Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.630
They allow us to invest very little money.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.470
Starting a campaign with very little investment.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.930
The ROI of campaign B is higher than

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.230
that of campaign A.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.510
Here we must take into account the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.870
following.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.890
We have attracted the same number

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.410
of visitors.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.670
We see that here, in this case,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.450
in the case of campaign B, we have

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.490
spent more money.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.010
That is, the cost per visit

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.890
is higher.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.110
However, then, when we make the final

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.630
account, we convert more and, in

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.950
addition, every person who buys

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.810
spends more money.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.970
We must make the final

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.710
account.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.010
In this case, we sold 100 units.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.210
We sold 200 units.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.870
Why is?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.130
The conversion rate is higher.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.370
Then we multiply it

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.850
by the average ticket.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.530
If we count, we will find that

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.410
the ROI of the B campaign is

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.050
higher.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.850
How bigger is it?

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.850
The ROI of the B campaign is

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.870
3.2.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.590
For every euro we invest, we

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.370
generate 3.2 sales.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.050
In display campaigns, all cost

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.990
models are possible.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.210
It is indeed so.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.510
But the most common, almost

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.790
always, is the CPM.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.370
SEM is more immediate than SEO.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.890
Yes, SEM is an outbound strategy

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.230
in which we pay for those

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.550
ads.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.130
SEO is pure email marketing.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.030
In this case, it is more immediate,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.550
the return is more short-term in the SEM.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.110
We have made changes on the website.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.390
Imagine, you changed the texts,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.750
you changed a header, you changed

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.990
the structure, you put a

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.730
pop-up, whatever you want.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.990
What we need to know is whether these changes

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.970
have gone to better or worse.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.230
So what metric can we use?

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.290
We always have two options.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.190
First, look at the conversion

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.710
ratios, the percentages.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.510
Second, we must consider absolute values.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.470
For example, sales or leads.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.290
We always have to

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.530
look at the percentages.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.470
Because it is that absolute values

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.410
take into account that they can depend,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.890
for example, on the traffic you have

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.950
already generated that day.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.570
You have invested more or less

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.270
in marketing.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.750
The percentages do not deceive us.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.370
The percentages tell us what

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.650
percentage of those customers

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.810
have done what we want.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.310
Whether it is to leave the data, buy, etc.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.250
Conversion rates are always

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.470
a better indicator.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.450
If we work on lead nurturing,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.590
what are we going to improve?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.350
The CPM.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.890
CPM is what you pay for every

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.470
1,000 impressions in an ad.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.790
Lead nurturing has nothing to do

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.190
with it.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.410
CPL is the cost per lead, which makes

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.910
it difficult to capture each lead.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.830
Nor is it.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.350
Lead nurturing, what helps

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.830
us is that once we have leads,

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.970
we will make them better.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.090
Therefore, the cost per

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.050
acquisition, or also the cost

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.070
of customer acquisition, will

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.330
be lower.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.990
Usability is key when

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.870
we sell low-impact products.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.810
For example, we have a

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.390
30 euro glasses.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.710
That is something very immediate, of

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.630
little importance, say, of low implication.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.270
Or when we sell high-impact

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.490
products, in which we need

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.070
a lot of information.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.690
We need to mature it, etc.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.890
Well, because usability is more

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.110
important when we sell

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.190
low-impact products.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.450
The influencers who have the most

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.610
engagement are those who have

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.550
a larger or smaller community or

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.350
audience.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.650
The smaller the audience, the

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.510
more relationship there is, the more engagement

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:44.070
there is between the community or the

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.730
audience and the influencer.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.440
What can we do to optimize

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.140
conversions along the funnel?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.740
Let us see.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.180
Well, here what we are asked is

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.280
to select the wrong one, but let’

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.360
s see one by one.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.820
Attracting high quality traffic.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.140
Because the higher the quality

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.400
of traffic, the greater

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.380
the conversion.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.160
Can we impact those who have

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.080
visited us again through retargeting?

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.620
Also perfectly.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.460
Can we create a lead nurturing

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.040
strategy?

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.520
Yes, to leads that we can impact

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.280
again through emails, etc.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.000
Optimize conversions on the web,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.680
improving usability, for example,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.400
improving CTAs and more?

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.120
Or minimize the cost per thousand

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.000
of campaigns?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.740
This last one has nothing to

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.760
do with it.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.700
Minimizing the cost per thousand

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.960
of campaigns has nothing to do with

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.780
conversions.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.720
And finally, how is lead nurturing

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.100
done?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.700
Well, because mainly through

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.900
an email flow using

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.820
a marketing automation

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.740
tool.
