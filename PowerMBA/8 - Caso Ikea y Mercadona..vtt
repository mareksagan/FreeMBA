WEBVTT

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100
Today I want to analyze two cases

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.640
that we have already seen before, and

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.540
also have seen them on several occasions,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.980
such as the case of Ikea and the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.240
case of Mercadona.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480
But now that we know, in addition

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.520
to the value curve, we know the Rize

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.300
matrix, I want to analyze them

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.160
using the Rize matrix because

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.120
you’ll see how this tool allows

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.760
us to visualize very well what

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.280
are the innovations in the

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.800
value proposal.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.460
How are strategic movements?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.660
It is a very practical tool

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.960
that I love.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.160
Let’s start with IKEA.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.580
The first thing we have to do is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.320
to analyze what is the value curve

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.420
of the furniture sector, its

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.300
competitors.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500
What are the main factors?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440
Well, as the price is clear, the quality

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.160
of the furniture, the design

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.380
of the furniture, the proximity,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.300
the proximity, the convenience.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.040
Now keep in mind that we are

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.600
talking about a retail sector

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.320
and this is always a key factor,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.260
being close to consumers.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.180
And also in this case, keep

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.340
in mind that the investment is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.220
very high because being close

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500
to, being in the urban centers

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.280
brings a very high square

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.060
meter rental.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.960
This is a very important factor

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.260
that also involves a lot of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.440
investment.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.740
The post-sales service and the variety

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.260
of products.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.260
By the variety of products I mean

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.700
that there are retailers that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.380
offer furniture of all kinds

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.940
and others focus on for example

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.120
concrete products such as kitchen,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.720
lounges.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.420
We will draw the value curves

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.260
in the sector.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.560
We have on the one hand

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980
the competitors who offer

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.840
a more premium product in which

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.720
the value curve is up and

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.060
the crazy ones is down.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.980
The only point to highlight is

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.880
that the variety of crazy ones

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.200
is usually a little larger because

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.500
it is usually a little larger,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.840
more remote and with more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.740
product variety.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.040
And now what we’re going to do

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.660
is let’s use the RICE matrix

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.940
to understand what IKEA has

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.380
done to understand its success.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940
And we start with the factors that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.260
IKEA has reduced far below the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.820
rest of the industry and that has

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.120
obviously allowed it to reduce

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.720
costs.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.160
What factor has decreased?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.840
The proximity or convenience

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.160
has been reduced.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.180
If you think, Ikea stores

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.200
are outside of the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.860
big cities when traditional

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.880
old furniture stores

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.060
were in the cities.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.120
This is a factor that lowers

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.640
the cost a lot because the square

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.880
meter is much cheaper outside

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.440
the city.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.440
I think Ikea would have such

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.720
an attractive proposal that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.060
customers would move

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.620
to their stores.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.300
One factor that has eliminated IKEA

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.280
that we have already discussed

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.440
other times and that involves or implies

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.400
a huge reduction in cost is the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.880
fact that you mount the furniture.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.580
This has a significant impact on

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.640
logistics and so on.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.200
All this allows you to significantly

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.040
reduce the price compared to your competitors.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.680
But IKEA is not only a low cost

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.080
as we saw but it has also managed

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.540
to increase a number of factors

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.300
that allow it to offer

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.280
more value.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.460
One of them is immediate.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.140
You may not have thought about it,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.600
but if you want to buy furniture

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.320
at IKEA when you go to IKEA, buy

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.820
the furniture, take it home and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.660
have it at home that same day.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.340
If you are planning to build them, you already

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.940
have the furniture.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.080
It is all very immediately.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.440
Traditionally, buying furniture

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020
was not so, it was a longer

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.680
process.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.680
The after-sales service of IKEA is exceptional.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.900
This is a value that has increased

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.200
compared to the rest.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.360
You have 365 days to return the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.980
furniture even if you have

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.880
used it.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.280
The ease of buying.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.720
It is designed to make it easy

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.400
to buy.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.820
You have the catalogs, guides, etc.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.140
The facility of resale is a factor

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.640
that had never been taken into

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.280
account so far.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.260
But the reality is that there are

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.120
people who furnish tourist

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.060
apartments and other or temporary, students.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.880
And they know that IKEA furniture

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.340
has a much easier resale than the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.100
rest of the furniture.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.300
Because they are models that are even

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.060
known in the market with the name

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.820
of the model.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.040
Another factor is that you can equip

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.360
your entire home.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.740
This is a great advantage because it provides

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.720
a lot of comfort.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.220
Not just furniture, but equipment.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.520
You can buy absolutely everything

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.040
you need.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.860
A home, go to IKEA, spend a few

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.460
hours, come back and have your home

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.480
equipped.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.060
These are factors that IKEA

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.780
has increased compared to the rest.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.200
The value curve we have on

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.400
the screen is very different.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.320
We have on the one hand a lower

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.440
price than premium and a bit

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.720
higher than low cost pures.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.380
The quality is much higher than the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.040
low cost.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.440
The design is at the level of premium

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.140
brands.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.680
They have come down very much, as we see

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.900
in the curve, the proximity.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.540
And then on a number of factors that

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.780
would be the focus of differentiation.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.700
The level is much higher.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.440
The ease of buying, the speed,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.320
that you can furnish your entire

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.060
home, the after-sales service, etc.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.080
By looking at the value curve,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.320
we understand what the difference between

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.900
the value proposition of IKEA

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.100
and the rest of its competitors is.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.680
And the RIC matrix has helped us understand

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.420
how they did it.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.900
We will analyze the Mercadona value

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.840
curve.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.980
Mercadona is a case that we have talked

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.020
about many times and we will talk

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.180
about many times because there

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.400
are many things to learn from.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.040
The first thing we will do is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.340
to analyze the value curve

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.420
of the food sector.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.340
What are the factors?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.360
Let us think.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.040
The price and quality of

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.960
the products are obvious.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.680
The variety of products, that in

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.900
a supermarket or hypermarket

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.140
you can have different

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.160
products.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.840
In the supermarkets you have less variety,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.780
in the supermarkets you have

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.640
more variety, you have everything.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.320
The variety of brands, you

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.980
can choose from many brands.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.240
The quality of the white mark.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.420
Parking, for example, the

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.020
comfort that you can get and park.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.660
Have good offers.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.460
The room should be clean, have

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.400
a good atmosphere, etc.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.520
and personal service.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.460
I would say that they are

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.640
the main factors around

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.660
which the food distribution

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.140
industry competes.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.680
And that are the factors that

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920
make customers decent for one

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.720
or the other.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.400
I will show you how the Mercadona

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400
value curve varies from

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.600
a competitive supermarket.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.620
We’ll think of a supermarket of

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.000
about 300-500 square meters.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.020
We are not talking about

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.820
a hypermarket, but a supermarket

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.300
that is its direct competitor.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.120
Let us start with the factors that

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.420
Mercadona has reduced or eliminated

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.960
with the aim of reducing

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.660
the cost.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.400
It is clear that Mercadona, in addition,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.220
was a strategy that was very commented

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.000
at the time, but that has been

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.500
successful.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.780
It has greatly reduced the variety

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.720
of brands in each category.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.740
That is, if you want to buy yogurt,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.380
instead of having X brands, because

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.420
there are many fewer.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.300
This allows Mercadona to

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.620
reduce costs because it manages

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.060
its suppliers better.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.260
In addition, we would almost say that

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.860
you have eliminated one factor that

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.980
you have eliminated are the offers, the promotions.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.160
This also has an impact on the

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.700
internal cost because all management

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.580
is simpler than operations.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.100
Please note that you do not have

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.400
to make any brochures or change

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.920
prices.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.420
Accounting is easier.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.940
Thus, these two factors allow you

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.460
to, having reduced the variety of

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.060
brands and reducing or eliminating

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.120
promotions, allow you to

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.260
lower the price relative

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.880
to your competitors.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.840
A very clear consequence.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.060
And now we will look at the factors

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.660
that Mercadona has increased and

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.760
which allow it, obviously, to

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.380
provide a differential value.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.620
One of them is the variety of products.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.220
The variety of Mercadona products

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.800
is much superior to that of

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.440
a similar size supermarket.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.540
It can be comparable to what

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.520
you can find in a supermarket.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.420
In locations that are much larger,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.280
which obviously have more variation.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.340
It also improves the quality

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.660
of its brand.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.060
There are also additional

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.860
services, such as

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.780
parking.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.020
Almost all the markets have parking,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.140
and they are very good.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.600
They are clean, clean, etc.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.480
And very easy to access.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.980
And with regard to the cleaning

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.560
and environment of the oral weight,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.700
we can say that it has increased a little

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.580
the investment it makes in these factors

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.240
and the value perceived by the

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.620
public.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.980
For example, I think that Mercadona

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.600
employees’ salaries are

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.140
above the market average.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.780
As we have seen, there has been

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.780
an increase in investment

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.640
and customer perception.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.440
As we can see, Mercadona’s value curve

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.160
is very different from that of

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.240
the rest of its competitors.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.840
And here, from this perspective,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.800
we can explain the reason why it

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.260
has been so successful.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.080
With that growth so exaggerated

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.760
and also have tens of thousands

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.820
of customers who are absolutely

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.080
loyal to the brand.
