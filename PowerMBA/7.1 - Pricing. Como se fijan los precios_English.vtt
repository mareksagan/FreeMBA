00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.480
Well, and finally, I want you

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.600
to understand a concept, we

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360
see it on screen, it is the curve

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.560
of demand elasticity.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.940
It is a concept, it is a basic,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.920
very basic model of the economy,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.020
which we will analyze in detail

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.080
when we get to the economy

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.460
block, that basically what the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.480
demand curve draws us is how

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.440
it affects the amount we will

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.540
sell the variations in the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.960
price.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.820
If I get a little lower,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.120
what will happen?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.700
I’ll sell the same, I’ll sell

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.640
a lot more, if I raise the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.800
price, what will happen?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.120
And we have, really this is a very

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.100
theoretical model, but it’s convenient

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.180
that you understand it well and there

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
could be two extremes.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.100
A very unelastic curve,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.880
completely unelastic.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.380
What does this mean?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.240
That we do what we do with prices,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.460
and we would have a curve that

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.940
is perfectly elastic, which is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.380
the opposite, and is that if we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.540
lower the price a little we will

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.920
sell a lot more.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.440
This, as we have said, is a theoretical

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.900
model and at the end we are never

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.940
at one end or another, but it is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.280
important that you understand this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300
well, because the elasticity or sensitivity

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.520
that your customers have to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.360
the increases or decreases in

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.400
prices is something you have

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.300
to understand and that you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.340
should even try.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.160
For example, in digital environments

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.400
it is increasingly easier to test

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.620
it, because you can measure very quickly,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.460
you can one day raise the price

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580
and measure what the conversion is.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.000
In the bottom, what you are measuring,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.560
what you are evaluating is this, is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600
whether the demand for your product

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.120
is very sensitive to those

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.900
decreases, those price increases.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.940
Then playing so at the end will

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.300
allow you to find the optimal point

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.980
where what you are maximizing

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.400
is, you are maximizing your income

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.780
that would be the amount for

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.460
the price.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.680
So all companies always have

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.860
to consider this triple

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.420
perspective when we want

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.100
to set prices to shoot the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.780
diana and is it what

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.660
are our costs?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.520
If we forget about our

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.340
costs, we may end up losing

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.020
money.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.140
What is the competition doing and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.480
what value do we bring to the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.240
customer?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.720
And we also have to take into account

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.420
this theoretical model that is the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.380
elasticity of demand, because

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.840
in accordance with that it is more

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.380
elastic or less elastic and we

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.760
will only know it almost by

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.780
testing, we will be able to maximize

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.560
that point of balance in which

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080
we maximize the price by

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.540
the number of units sold.
