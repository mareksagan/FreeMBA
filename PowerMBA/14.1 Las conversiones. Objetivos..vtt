00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.900
The goal in the middle part of the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.180
funnel is to get the greatest

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.040
return on those visits or that

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.580
traffic we have generated or that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.020
investment we have made.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.160
We need to optimize conversions.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.920
We have to make the largest number

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.020
of these visits possible to

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.900
become new customers or sales

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.320
or revenue, in revenue.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.560
What is the first thing we need to do?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.760
Be clear about what these conversions

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.880
are, what these ratios are,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.220
what those metrics are we have

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.300
to measure, manage, optimize,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.380
etc.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.920
If we do a good job here, if we

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.020
have perfectly identified

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.100
what those metrics are, it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.940
will be easier for us to

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.380
work on them, if we don't

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.220
go blind.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.420
We will not know why we are

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.320
doing things.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.940
The first thing I want you to know is

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.620
that we can classify the funnels basically

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.300
into two types.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
There is a shorter funnel in which we

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.940
go from visit to sale and there is no

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.680
lead by middle.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.460
This can be the case, for example,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.420
with e-commerce.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.480
Let's take the recurrent example

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.820
of Morrison, which is a shoe

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.600
brand that sells online.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.500
We have a longer funnel in which

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800
we have it is visits.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.060
We are going to create or

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.540
generate leads.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.040
These leads have to be converted

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.240
into sales.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.440
There are two conversion

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.820
ratios.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.540
We start with the shortest run.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.400
We are talking about sales.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.800
So here we have a primary

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.320
conversion ratio that is that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.760
number of sales or users who

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.820
have visited us.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.160
This is what we call macro conversion.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.420
This is your main conversion rate.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.760
But what is happening?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.960
Think of one thing.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.860
We have a conversion

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.120
rate of 1.5%.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.320
We know that 1.5 percent of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840
visits end up becoming a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.540
purchase.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.900
I now ask you the following.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.540
We want to optimize it.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.280
What do we do?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.900
What are the slopes we

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.640
should touch?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.040
From this metric, we do not

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.300
have much information.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.040
Why is it?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.000
Because we don't know what's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.020
happening and that's why it's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.160
very much recommended to do a deeper

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.320
analysis and move from macro

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.760
conversion to micro conversions.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.480
That is, identify which are in the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.820
customer's journey all the stages or

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.340
the main stages through which the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.580
customer passes and measure one

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.100
by one what are the challenges

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.520
of the purchase.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.160
Let us think of the case of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.740
Morrison.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.940
We move from the macro conversion

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.120
to identifying what are the intermediate steps.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.880
Which are they?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.720
For example, after visiting

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.480
the visit, when someone

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.820
is browsing the website,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.820
what he does is enter the detail

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.140
of some of the shoes and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.980
choose the size and color,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.880
for example.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.240
In some cases, the next step

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.940
is what?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.240
Add it to the shopping cart

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.060
and what next?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.160
to buy.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.660
Well, if we measure the micro conversions

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.080
in each of the stages we

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.480
will be able to manage it.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180
We will be able to identify if

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.360
it turns out that in some of the phases

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.320
there is a problem, we are losing customers,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.180
etc.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.980
We have the micro conversions

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.740
and we have the macro conversions.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.560
This is how we can manage it.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.430
We now go to a longer funnel,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.450
a funnel in which what we do

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.350
is first generate traffic,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.170
then the goal is to attract

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.450
leads, generate leads and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.910
then turn them into sales.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.030
So what is the first of the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.850
ratios?

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.030
This is the percentage of leads

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.470
we capture from all the visits

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.370
we generate.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.030
This is the first of the macro conversions.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.750
That obsesses us with all companies

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.130
that have a funnel of this

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.810
type.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.510
We need to optimize everything so that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.570
more and more leads enter the embankment.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.010
Next PostNext What is the Conversion

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.990
Ratio?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.390
The percentage of sales generated

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.990
on these leads.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.790
From sales or new customers,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.430
that depends on each case.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.010
But really interesting is to adapt

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.750
it to your case and define the steps

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.930
A consultant who is doing an

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.470
inbound marketing strategy generating

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.190
a lot of content on the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.270
network and that content

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.110
is allowing you to attract

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.650
traffic to the website.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.150
And on the website there

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.170
is a form and those who are

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.790
interested fill out that

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.730
form and there is generating a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.070
lead.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.670
A lead is generated.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.730
But really what we want is, the next

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.550
step is that those people who have

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.210
some interest in those leads

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.430
come to visit us and what

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.730
we do is call everyone.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.150
A percentage of the people who fill

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.270
out the form will come to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.670
see us at the office.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.170
And then, when we meet with them,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.790
we present them with our proposal,

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.670
we analyze theirs, etc.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.690
We will sell or capture

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.670
a percentage of those customers.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.430
We have microconversions.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.710
It turns out that 1% of people who

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.270
visit us fill out the form.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.970
Of those who fill out the form,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.830
which we call all, 50% come

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.670
to the office.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.910
Of those, 50% are new

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.590
customers.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.010
With this level of detail,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.850
being able to permanently analyze

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.330
micro conversions and their

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.170
evolution over time, what

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.290
we can do is focus on improving

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.010
things that are not working.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.410
Improve how we are asking for data

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.810
in the form, improve the phone

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.770
call, if we send you an email before

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.950
calling you after, the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.750
face-to-face meeting, etc.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.050
Now let's go to another case.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.970
Think of a restaurant, for

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.590
example.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.730
A restaurant that what it does is

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.550
on the website very spectacular

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.750
photos, etc.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.230
And the goal is that you book

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.990
a table and you can do it by

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.530
call or you can do it by means

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.070
of the application but they have

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.610
to convert the lead, because effectively

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.130
at the end the reservation

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.290
has to materialize and

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.850
this person has to go

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.310
to the restaurant.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.470
We have two ratios.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.770
10% of the visitors reserve a table.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.610
Of those who book a table,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.130
70% end up going to the restaurant.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.870
We have two conversion ratios.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.370
If, for example, we would like

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.770
to increase the second ratio,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.530
well, because what we could

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.450
do would be sending a SMS, for

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.390
example, or sending a WhatsApp

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.990
or a tracking call or

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.910
something like that.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.030
Well, we've already understood

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.050
what macro conversions are, what

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.570
are the main conversion ratios

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.070
and micro conversions,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.690
what you have to do is think

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.570
about how your funnel is,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.070
how each of the steps is, identify

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.850
those metrics and be measuring

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.510
them permanently.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.110
Now let us consider the following.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.370
So far what we have are ratios

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.590
that are aggregated of all

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.730
the traffic we receive,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.490
but we can't do that.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.430
What we have to do is measure the

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.310
ratios for each of the sources

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.710
of traffic or the sources

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.730
or channels from where they come.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.970
Imagine that you have, you are

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.030
investing in Google AdWords, you

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.410
are investing in LinkedIn, you

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.850
are investing in programming, in

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.310
display, various channels.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.470
You have to measure the conversion

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.690
rates for each channel.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.190
Why is it?

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.590
Because each channel brings you

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.070
a different traffic and if you don't do

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.950
so it's very possible that you're

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.090
deforming the analysis.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.030
Imagine that we have a conversion

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.530
ratio in an e-commerce of 1.5 %

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.830
on visit and we are investing

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.950
and we have made new deals and we

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.470
are multiplying the number of visits

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.730
because we are expanding the

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.770
number of channels and it results

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.390
that from 1% we have gone

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.010
to 0.3 in a month.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.750
What is what happens?

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.170
What is needed to improve

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.270
conversions, etc.? to

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.130
We do not have to improve anything.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.590
Just what we have to do is select

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.690
other traffic sources, but

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.730
we don't know that if we don't

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.110
have it segmented.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.710
If we don't get it done, we

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.650
can draw wrong conclusions.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.910
The recommendation is that you

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.210
always have a dashboard where

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.810
you measure conversion ratios

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.410
segmented by traffic sources

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.750
and it would be good to segment

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.570
them according to customer

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.370
segments.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.550
The segmentation you want or that

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.310
you have some sense in your business,

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.230
because we can segment you by

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.110
purely demographic topics

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.270
by ages or we can segment by

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.090
geographies or by profiles,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.950
but it is interesting to

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.130
do so too.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.290
Why is it?

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.490
Because it will allow us to obtain

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.370
a lot of information, it will allow

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.030
you to identify if, for example,

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.730
conversion rates have fallen in

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.410
a given customer segment or if there

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.870
is a customer segment in which you

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.210
lose much more and it is interesting

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.890
that you continue to invest

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.130
there.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.600
So to finish conclusion

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.500
we identify what are the conversion

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.980
ratios, the macros and the micro

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.060
and what we do is systematically

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.540
measure those ratios for each

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.300
of the segments either in

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.140
terms of where traffic comes

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.480
from or what are the customer

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.180
segments and we always have

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.320
them in a dashboard that

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.840
we will measure permanently

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.380
to go seeing how each

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.700
improvement we do affects

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.040
or to identify where we

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.200
are failing.
