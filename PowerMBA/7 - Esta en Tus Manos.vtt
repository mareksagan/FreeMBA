00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.020
In The Power MBA, in The Power

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.760
Launch Formula, what we acquire are

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.020
the knowledge, the method, the

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.920
formula that helps us tremendously

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.300
to succeed.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.260
We always say that knowledge

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.460
puts you to another level.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.420
This is the competitive advantage.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.860
But to be realistic, you have

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.700
goals, you have wishes.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.240
In some cases, it's mounting a company,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.580
evolving your company, whatever

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.140
it is.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.180
Only with knowledge, if only what you

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.060
do is incorporate content into

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.000
your head, because it will not change

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.680
anything.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.420
It is not enough.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.900
And what we have designed is this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.980
simple formula.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.880
And that is, your dream will come

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.460
if you have the knowledge and also

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.900
create the circumstances for this

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.600
to happen.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.480
This of creating circumstances, we

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.380
have learned, we have taken

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.760
it from the book we recommend, which

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.500
is called The Good Luck, written

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.660
by Álex Rovira.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.420
I remember that Hugo Arevalo recommended

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.420
it to me, who you already know, a few

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.520
years ago and the truth is that I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.940
loved it.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.260
It's a book that you can read, because

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.320
I don't know, I think you read it in

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.860
an hour.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.760
In this book, you will find a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.080
few very important ideas

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660
and I will summarize some.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.460
It is a fact that good or

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.100
bad luck does not exist.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.880
There are no people who have

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.400
good luck systematically.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.140
We can find good

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.400
luck, we can create

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.840
it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.780
We can pursue good luck and if

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.220
we pursue it will come and how?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.620
Creating the circumstances for

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.140
things to happen.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.560
This is the case, in very brief terms.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.720
For example, Hugo recommended

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.780
it to me so I will relate it to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.260
him.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.000
Hugo has people who can say, it's not

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.160
that he's been very lucky.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.400
Well, that is a ridicule.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.660
What happens is that Hugo has

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.920
created since he was very young

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.600
the circumstances with a good attitude

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300
in general in many things.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.980
The circumstances for

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.760
that good luck.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.640
That is why he has had such a great professional success.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.940
In our case, we are talking about

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.380
launching successful innovative companies,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.880
etc.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.420
We are talking about the Power Launch Formula.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.440
How do you apply the creation of circumstances here?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.460
Well, that depends on each case.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.420
Working on weekends, if

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.740
you have work, saving

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.880
something.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.300
Because at some point you will

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
have to have some money.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.820
Not much, but you have to have something.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.360


00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.200
If what you do is buy a funded

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.180
car and spend your next

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.360
five years' salary and you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.200
never have a hard one, it's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
harder to do.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.920
What you are looking for

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.640
is bad luck, not good luck.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.720
For example, looking for jobs

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.220
where you prioritize learning

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.660
or surround yourself with people

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.300
you can learn from looking

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.180
for jobs where you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.780
are prioritizing wages

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.280
or security, for example.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.020
In the end, the circumstances

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.020
depend on each one.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.180
But we want you to reflect

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.000
on a number of things.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.980
First, what are the circumstances

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.380
you have to create

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.820
from today to those

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.040
dreams?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.420
Second, what are you doing?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.860
Are you consistent with those dreams

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.720
or not?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.800
Because what we don't want to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.820
happen is what happens to many

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.160
people who have dreams but do

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.660
nothing.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.640
And in the end, his life doesn't

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.280
change because he doesn't really get in the way.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.860
Now you will have knowledge and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.080
we will encourage you to believe

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.900
the circumstances for you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.820
to those dreams.
