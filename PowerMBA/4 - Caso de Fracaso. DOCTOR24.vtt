00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.890
Izanami, I would love to tell

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.730
you the case of Dr.24 and what we're

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.070
going to do is go linking it to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.990
Lean Startup.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.130
Let us start by telling you a little about

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.710
the context from which this comes.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.290
Because Dr.24 is a clear case of

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.030
building a product that then at

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.250
the time of truth nobody wanted.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.910
Dr.24 was an intra-entrepreneurial

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.450
I did within a pharmaceutical company

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.250
and something that at first

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.930
seemed fantastic to me of having

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.170
a lot of resources, not having

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.310
that component of uncertainty

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.030
that I had had in previous projects

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610
that was pure entrepreneurship,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.470
without a safety

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.370
mattress.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.210
A salary and so on, right?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.810
I had a salary, a salary and all that.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.170
I didn't believe it, 14 payments.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.370
In the life of an entrepreneur

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.210
it is like what at first

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.650
seemed to me to be a brutal

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.570
advantage.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.570
Then in the long run I think I put

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810
a fee at the end to the project because

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.730
one of the good and bad things

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.970
about startups is that uncertainty.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.610
That uncertainty that makes you

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.970
start hard and very tired and

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.850
need a lot of resilience,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
but at the same time awaken creativity

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.470
and gives you a hunger that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.690
is the cause of the success

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.130
of many projects.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.490
And we did not have that.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.850
Also, another thing to consider

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.630
when you build a project is to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.810
align the interests of

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.290
all the people who are within

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.710
the project, whether your

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.810
investors.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.870
Many people say no, it's because

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.790
you don't like to have bosses.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.650
I don't know if I prefer to have bosses and investors.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.950
In the end you have to align the interests

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.410
of a lot of people and in this case

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.850
the interests of the pharmaceutical

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.630
company, because they wanted to have

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.670
a product and wanted to have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.410
it quickly.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.550
So, a little because of that and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.410
a little because of the arrogance

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.990
with which you reach a new market

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.170
you say, we are super digital,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.110
super techies, we will disrupt

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.210
the health sector with

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.230
our app.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.010
There is a saying that makes a lot

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.570
of harm that is that if Henry Ford

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.670
had asked people what they

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.610
wanted, they would have said

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.810
faster horses.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.190
That phrase is very good to land,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.490
but at the same time it can spole you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.830
to fall in love with your idea and what

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.150
all this translated into.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.070
We spent almost a year

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.370
building a real work

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.170
of art.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.190
That was an app for video consultations

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.690
between doctors and patients

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.830
that we made with a RTC web

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.990
that we built internally

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.090
from scratch.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.530
We had a development crack team.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.510
I had never had such a team

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.950
with such good people.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.550
We are creating a real work of

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.890
art.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.770
You had money, you had support,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.430
you had stability, we had money

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.590
insured for a long time,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.370
which is something that in a startup

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.790
you usually have money for

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.670
six months.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.450
You are on the counter-clock all the time.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.230
We had a dream team.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.090
I looked at my team and said, what are

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.610
you doing here that you are not in

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.310
Silicon Valley?

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.530
Authentic crackers, ready people,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.390
we developed an authentic artwork at

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.790
a technical level, but when we

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.330
went out to sell this artwork to the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.390
sector, we started to sit down with

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.650
the customers and they told us,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.550
yeah, yes, it is phenomenal, but

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.670
consultations with doctors can not

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.410
be scheduled.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.750
It's not like we've made a type

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.490
of Uber.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.230
We need to be able to make

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.490
consultations.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.830
You sat with an insurance company,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.230
with a hospital, and they told

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.710
you, but can you choose a specialty?

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.390
Oysters you know?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.250
And we started doing all that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.350
validation process of what the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.070
market wanted.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.670
Once, we had spent a year and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.930
a lot of money building something

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.710
that was very well

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.030
built, but that didn't solve

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.670
anyone's problem at all.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.350
We are analyzing it.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.790
This is a book case, of

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.590
Lean Startup, and we can

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.690
relate it to the tips

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.290
that Lean Startup gives us.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.330
You built the whole product,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.730
say, complete, and with all

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.750
the functionalities, very

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.230
expensive, etc., from a hypothesis

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.890
that you have made

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.150
in your head.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.070
That is, in the office, without

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.070
validating it in the market,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.690
without talking to customers, when

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.110
you spent, I understand, a lot

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.290
of money, a large equipment for

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.710
a year, you delayed the exit to the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.110
market, that what it does

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.890
is delay that learning you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.010
had afterwards, that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.370
directly transmitted to you what

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.670
they needed, and it was not what

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.310
you had done.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.150
So it's really true that you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.110
made the mistakes that Lean Startup

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.090
clearly tells us we don't

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.950
have to do.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.830
and totally.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.110
And it was like you say a book thing,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.910
because then, when we already had the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.210
product created and we started to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.250
see that in addition each customer asked

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.390
us different things, you said,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.130
hear, because we are going to change it,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.610
but of course, you are going to change

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.450
it and there are three, four months

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.510
more for a contract that you don't know

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.090
if you're going to close and we

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.350
go back to what we talked about in

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.830
the previous class of lack of focus.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.790
Hear what do we do?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.970
Are we focused on doing something,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.710
doing it well, or are we running

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.150
behind the needs of all these siren

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.010
songs of potential customers

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.210
to build something

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.010
for them?

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.410
So we didn't have a clear business

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.490
model, didn't we?

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.510
From the beginning.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.930
No clear business model, and above

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.750
all what you didn't have was method,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.930
because if during that year, the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.250
first two weeks, you had done a demo,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.550
that there are tools,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.070
that anyone can even do it, without

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.910
knowing a demo of an application,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.090
it would have cost you 15 days

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.270
of a uncle, imagine, and

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.170
you would have sat down with all

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.890
the potential customers,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.090
all that learning you would have

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.110
had from the first day, would

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.130
have allowed you to build

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.170
a product that was closer,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.030
at least closer to what the

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.830
customer wants, and if during

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.990
that path you would have

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.930
forced them, say, to

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.810
make a...

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.990
So, try to make a real sale,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.790
right?

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.210
So, well, is that what

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.630
you like?

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.870
Well, then sign the contract, commit

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.350
yourself, etc., then, are you really

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.530
validating that there is a real

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.090
interest on the part of the

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.650
customer?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.210
Here is one thing we will see in

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.510
a class later, in more detail,

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.330
but it is the law of the

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.770
10 bills, and he asks you what

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.010
is, hear, bring me 10 bills,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.710
not 10 real bills, but a bill at

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.930
the end gives you a lot of information,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.470
gives you the names and surnames

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.770
of the type of customer you

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.290
go to, and goes on, what

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.550
will you charge him, how

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.910
will you pay him to then calculate

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.010
the cash flow?

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.650
We started developing a product

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.430
without having clear those bills,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.650
right?

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.390
Neither how much it would cost, nor

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.370
to whom we would sell it

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.150
later, nor what kind of payment

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.110
it would be, if it would be a subscription

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.170
model, if we would pay it once,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.370
if we would pay for implementation,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.490
we didn't have a clear business

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.790
model, and what we did was start

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.910
building a little for love of art

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.450
in the sense of just as a painter

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.870
spends his hours painting for

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.210
the beautiful things that are

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.530
left to the painting, I think

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.990
we came in a moment, in such

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.170
a moment of falling in love

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.530
with our idea that we already

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.370
did things to do something

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.530
very beautiful and very

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.150
well done.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.630
If I had to summarize it in one of

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.270
Lean Startup keys I would say,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.890
what you did wrong is that

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.450
you said, of course, that what

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.710
you had in your head was what

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.550
customers wanted.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.210
So, from that idea, you built

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.990
a great product, as you

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.930
said, wonderful or something

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.850
like that, didn't you?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.910
But it was wonderful in your

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.990
head, but then I feel that it

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.370
wasn't what customers wanted.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.850
Another mistake we made, which,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.770
in addition, another thing that spole

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.630
us to get to this mistake, was that

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.350
in the United States there were

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.710
people with identical products

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.070
to which we were building and was

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.310
going phenomenal to them.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.050
And we made the mistake

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.030
of extrapolating, which is also

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.490
a very common mistake of, hear, if

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.450
this is working in the United

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.570
States, why won't it work in

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.050
Spain?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.870
And there is no why.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.150
It is true that to a certain extent

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.150
it is valid that it is being done

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.970
in other markets and is working, you

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.170
are validating it, you hear, because

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.210
this market is beginning to move,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.050
this sector, but in the times, the

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.790
markets are very different and in

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.910
our case, in addition, that

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.250
we were in the health sector, the

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.250
barriers of entry and the peculiarities

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.090
of each sector are brutal.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.410
Then we came to a sector, the health

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.490
sector in Spain, which is super different

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.910
from that of the United States,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.810
in which a product we knew was

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.970
identical to what was being

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.810
done in the United States,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.550
therefore, did not find place.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.650
Well, Aleja, as long as there is

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.130
some uncertainty, something, because

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.310
here there was, there was less, because

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.110
in the United States it was happening,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.430
but it turned out that the client

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.230
here did not want it, as long as

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.950
there is some uncertainty,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.170
say, that uses the philosophy

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.770
the Instarta for rajatabla,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.070
which will save you a lot

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.650
of problems.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.750
And when you talk about that, of internationalization,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.610
I am remembering that the owner

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.910
Evita Antel told me that when they went

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.750
to the United States, he opened,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.810
I don't know if one, several clinics

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.030
in Manhattan and so on, he copied

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.650
the model that works here,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.090
took it there, here he was going phenomenal,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.510
then he had many problems, but

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.690
he was going very well, and he

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.670
had to palm, I don't know, tens

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.290
of millions of dollars, but for

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.850
something that was very easy

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.050
to anticipate, you know?

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.310
That private insurance there

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.330
works differently, etc., right?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.270
But that doesn't have because,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.450
effectively, whenever there is risk,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.050
validate it first.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.030
Valid it and get rid of your idea no matter

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.330
how difficult it is.
