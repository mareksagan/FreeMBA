00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.000
Álvaro, in the program we have

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.740
studied the entrance barriers of the

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.680
different sectors and in particular

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.120
we have seen that the software sector

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.520
generates enormous entrance

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.320
barriers for potential

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.520
competitors.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.140
What are the key factors

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.640
that create this barrier?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.640
Well, the software world actually

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.680
has barriers that you call

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.660
barriers and I call advantages.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.340
You call it barriers when you are

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.940
outside the castle, you call it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.600
advantages when you are inside the castle.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.060
As I was inside the castle and also

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.100
my castle was of the largest,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.020
because it was a very big advantage.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.520


00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240
The first is the regulation.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.040
That is, the world of software,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220
the world of management software

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.900
above all, which is where I have

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200
been fully focused, has a legal

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.520
limit, labor accounting, invoicing,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.580
electronic invoice, thousands

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.760
of examples, which are

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.680
community, local, national,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880
international regulations

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.720
that force a series of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.020
changes.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.320
That’s a barrier for those who

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.360
want to get in because it forces

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.620
them to be changing and it’s an

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
advantage because it makes

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.140
your users have to be changing

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920
and over with a complexity so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.980
switching to a third is even

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.840
greater.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.660
That is a idiosyncrasy of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.820
our industry.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.500
The following is the component of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.140
human preparation, knowledge

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.300
of that and also that you have

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.220
to pay attention to a legal

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.720
requirement in time and in form.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.860
That is, you the document 348

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.160
that you have to submit it annually,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.740
as not present you a huge

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.480
fine.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.620
Then the risk of making a change to a

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.380
third party you have to make sure that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.960
you will learn that new program

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.740
and that in time and in form

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.160
you will adjust it.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.680
All this is to explain that when

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.960
a user decides to change that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.340
barrier for those out or that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.260
wall that Spotify for the new

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.080
streamer that has just come out.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.760
What is the risk of not hearing music

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.520
tonight?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.760
What is the risk if I change my accounting

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680
from today to tomorrow?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.000
Will I pay VAT?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.700
I don’t know how many thousands of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.240
euros.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.000
Here is it.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.640
The next theme is the training, the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.180
preparation of the people who manage

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.100
that program.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.060
A program, however simple a new

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.120
learning curve, puts employees

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.280
in front of a challenge that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.080
is sometimes complicated.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.260
I think that’s an idiosyncrasy

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.140
that has our industry, there

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.460
are others that have others

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.340
by complexity, by

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.780
technology, etc.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.060
This one is exactly what is

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.080
the main.
