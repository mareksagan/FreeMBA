00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.930
Today we will talk about the famous

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.510
DAFO, which is probably the most

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.710
well-known model of strategy and

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.490
marketing.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.250
I am sure it sounds like you.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.810
By the way, DAFO is the term used

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.230
in Spain, FODA is used frequently

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.250
in Latin America and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.290
SWOT Analysis is in English.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.910


00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.570
The DAFO is a relatively

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630
simple tool to understand how

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.890
it works, but what is more complicated

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.010
is to do good analysis

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.350
from the DAFO, which is

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.550
what we should learn

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.930
to do today.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.410
First, what is the DAFO?

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.610
What is the DAFO for?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.210
DAFO is a strategic analysis

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.430
or diagnostic tool.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670
In particular, it is a tool that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.250
allows us to understand and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.910
analyze very well and in a very

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.170
simple way what is the current

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.490
situation of our company, from

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.030
internal, external, etc. perspectives.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.470
It helps us to do this analysis, to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.190
think.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.670
Why is this important?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.090
Well, because diagnosis

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.010
is always the first step in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.510
planning or decision making.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.270
When is DAFO used?

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.950
It is actually used at very

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.090
different times.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.070
It is used when you make a strategic

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.670
plan, is one of the tools

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.730
you will use to make the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.650
diagnosis or when you make

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.950
a marketing plan.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.610
Sometimes it is used for obligation.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.770
When you have to present a project,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.310
imagine that you have an entrepreneurial

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.670
project, etc., in many cases you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.130
are requested the DAFO, because

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.250
it is a tool that everyone knows

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.490
and it is important that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.330
we do it well.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.950
The DAFO is a useful tool and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.150
we recommend using it on

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.210
a lot more occasions.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.370
If you want to make concrete

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.570
decisions, enter a particular

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170
market or, well, launch a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.970
new product, etc., it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.290
is good to make a DAFO, because

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.210
you quickly acquire very interesting

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.010
conclusions.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.590
Let us now see what the structure

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.350
of the DAFO is and how we must

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.490
carry out the order.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.190
Sometimes the order is put in

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.830
a different way.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.350
In this case, what we have are

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.350
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.190
and threats.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.970
The first point we have to understand

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.030
well is that the DAFO actually

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.610
consists of two types of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.830
analysis.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.330
It consists of an internal analysis,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.430
which are strengths and weaknesses.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.530
We will analyze the company,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.970
we will analyze ourselves and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.150
it consists of an external analysis.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.590
We will look outside and there we will

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.850
extract if there are opportunities

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790
or there are threats.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.270
Let's start with the internal analysis.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.230
Let us start with the internal analysis,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.630
with the internal factors.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.030
What we have to do is, as we have

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.950
said, to analyze our company,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.530
the current situation of our company

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.350
with the aim of identifying whether

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.730
there are or we have strengths

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.850
or weaknesses that will help

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.810
us or not to generate competitive

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.210
advantages or reach

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.410
our goals.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.590
Here the hard thing is, well, I'm

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.630
going to analyze my company, but

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.310
where to start?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.450
So we have shared a list

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.010
of topics you should consider.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.170
Themes related to the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.290
brand, customer experience,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.410
product range, financial

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.290
capacity, human capital,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.990
networking, entry

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.310
barriers, efficiency

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.430
in operations,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.290
etc.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.930
It's easier, when you have a

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.310
listing, it's almost a checklist,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.250
I think you have to at least

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.690
look at it to see if you have

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.890
strengths or weaknesses in some

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.930
of those factors.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.510
Let us see some examples of fortresses.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.950
For strengths, it also results that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.670
we are better at something very specific

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.310
or that we have a very specific

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.310
knowledge that others do not have

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.250
or our brand is more potent than

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.530
that of the competition and we can

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.830
build that, we can make a product

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.510
development or we can increase

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.930
the prices by leveraging

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.050
on that brand that we have.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.410
We may have agreements with

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.070
suppliers, we may have assets

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.650
that are very valuable.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.690
Imagine you have a restaurant

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.210
and you have the best place

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.210
in the city.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.770
You may have patents or more

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.170
money than others, better access

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.570
to financial resources, more ability

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.590
to finance yourself to grow.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.270
It can be that your brand positioning

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.450
is more potent or that you have,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.630
imagine, better knowledge

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.090
of your customers, you are a company

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.610
closer to your customers

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.370
than the rest or you have a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.110
broader range of products, etc.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.090
But what is the other side

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.970
of the coin, at the end?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.250
In some cases we have weaknesses.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.990


00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.570
Imagine, we don't have clear strategic

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.610
plans, we're going a little bit out

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.650
of course or on the contrary

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.170
we have less ability to access

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.490
financing, we may lack knowledge

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.830
or experience something

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.030
specific.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.470
Imagine you know less about technology

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.730
than others or less about marketing

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.950
than others.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.830
We have a structure that is very heavy,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.350
that is less flexible, that is difficult

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.150
to innovate, or that we have

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.790
a higher cost structure, which is

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.510
weakening us in relation to competition.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.950
Imagine that we have a less prepared

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.630
trading force or we have

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.470
less motivated teams, etc.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.150
I'm sure you already understand

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.930
a bit what the analysis approach is.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.710
The first thing you need to know

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.570
is where to look and from

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.950
there we have to identify if

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.150
we have strengths or weaknesses

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.970
that will help us our goals,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.010
grow in the market, etc.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.570
Now, let's go to the external analysis.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.910
What we do here is look

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.770
outside.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.610
Looking out for what?

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.070
To identify whether external factors

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.010
are or will be generated opportunities

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.830
or threats that we have

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.130
to take into account.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.470
The challenge is, but what

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.630
analysis?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.350
Where do I begin to analyze?

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.650
We suggest you consider

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.290
five factors.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.570
First, we start with the market

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.910
and the customers.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.070
We will think about whether the

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.930
market we are targeting, well, whether

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.030
it will grow or not, whether it

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.310
will change, for example,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.690
the tastes or needs of customers,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.210
how it will evolve demand,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.270
behaviors, etc.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.810
We can think of the customers that is

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.070
always the most important thing.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.390
But outside there are also other

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.490
factors that can generate

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.850
opportunities or threats

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.250
such as suppliers, distributors.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.010
A very important factor are competitors.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.370
We need to analyze the competition.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.630
We have to see if its size, the

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.690
evolution it will have in the

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.550
coming years, etc.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.030
They create opportunities or threats.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.370
Or political, legal, regulatory,

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.530
etc.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.310
Or economic factors, such

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.410
as the economy, exchange

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.930
rates, the growth of the

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.170
economy in other types of markets,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.430
etc.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.630
Another factor to consider is

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.110
technology.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.690
Technology often creates

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.970
opportunities or threats.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.270
Well, from these factors, from the analysis

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.190
of those five factors, what

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.870
we have to identify is whether

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.690
we will be able to take advantage

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.670
of some opportunity, if they will

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.250
present some opportunity or, on

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.790
the contrary, they will generate

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.530
threats.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.190
Let us look at examples.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.610
Possible opportunities.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.710
Well, because maybe we can enter

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.850
new markets because some of

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.490
the markets or some of the segments

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.330
are growing or we can maybe

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.990
or what we have to do in this

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.150
case is to expand the range

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.230
of products because we

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.690
are identifying new needs

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.110
in some of the segments.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.450
Or it results, imagine, that the

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.270
purchasing capacity of your

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.950
customers, because the economic

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.250
cohort grows, etc.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.550
You know it will grow in the

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.390
coming years.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.010
Well, because from a conclusion

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.210
so what we should do would be

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.970
to invest or the same results

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.610
that we analyze the competition

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.390
and one of our most important

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.290
competitors has serious problems,

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.250
is losing its customers,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.070
etc.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.710
Or you have financial problems.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.030
We should make decisions

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.250
on this.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.430
We have to be more aggressive

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.690
or we have to buy them.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.090
It may be that the market is

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.390
growing very fast, which is

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.430
expected to grow very fast in

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.370
the coming years.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.350
Or imagine that it turns out that

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.650
in the medium term we will develop

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.490
a technology that will come very

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.390
well for us or to improve our

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.110
product or to be more cost efficient,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.050
etc.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.190
These are all opportunities

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.930
that we can identify from external

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.570
analysis.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.090
But also in many cases what

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.770
happens is that external

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.090
factors generate threats.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.950
We will give them examples.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.290
Imagine a very powerful foreign

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.790
competitor who plans to enter

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.010
our country and is heavily capitalized

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.050
or that political instability

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.990
or legal or economic

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.630
instability is growing

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.930
in some of the countries

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.930
in which we are present,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.290
for example.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.530
Or that we know that it is likely that

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.970
new laws will be passed that can

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.150
do us a lot of harm.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.330
Or there are tax changes.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.710
The tax time will rise and

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.050
we will have to pay much more

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.890
for corporate tax.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.930
Or, for example, it will increase

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.570
volatility or increase the

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.510
price of raw bacteria.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.010
Either it turns out that we sell

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.050
a product and the needs or tastes

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.550
of consumers are changing,

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.890
consumer patterns and

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.870
demand are deriving

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.610
to substitute products.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.890
What we have to

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.130
do is analyze.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.870
A internal analysis and from a

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.430
number of factors we have to do

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.990
a fairly comprehensive analysis.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.990
Looking at all the prospects of

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.210
the company we have to identify if

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.530
we have to go out and do an external

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.370
analysis.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.570
The key is not to lose anything.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.010
Analyze the market,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.210
competition, sector,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.710
political, legal, economic,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.430
technology, etc.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:14.850
Why is it?

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.970
Because this way we will be

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.090
able to identify whether there will be

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.610
opportunities that we can take advantage

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.570
of or if, on the contrary, they will

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.010
present threats to us.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.050
If there are threats, we have

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.310
to identify them in advance

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.830
to prepare ourselves.
