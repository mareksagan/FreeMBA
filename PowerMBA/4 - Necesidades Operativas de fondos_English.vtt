00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.310
Today we will talk about a very

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.030
common concept used almost

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.290
daily by analysts of Corporate

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.170
Finance, M & A, etc.,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.250
which are the operational

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.090
needs of funds.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.650
They are usually known by their acronym

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.730
NOF and in English they are called

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.070
Working Capital, which, of course,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.970
sometimes is translated into

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.530
Spanish as a maneuvering fund,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.690
but it is not exactly the

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.090
same.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.050
And I'm telling you that there is a lot of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.830
trouble with regard to terminology,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.950
but really the important thing is that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.910
we understand well what NOFs consist

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.970
of and what they inform us about.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.970
Now, let’s go to the balance.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.650
The first thing I want you to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.670
understand is the following.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.230
Really a company, the net

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.310
investment that a company has

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.570
to make to power, for its activity,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.090
is equal to on the one hand the non-

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.290
current assets, which are

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.590
the fixed assets, more, and here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.370
comes the appreciation and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.870
evolution with respect to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.030
the balance sheet situation, more

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.810
the operational needs of funds,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.050
which are not exactly equal

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.390
to the current asset.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.690
And the sum of these two amounts,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.630
fixed assets or non-current assets,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.430
plus operational fund needs,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.710
by the way, sometimes is less,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830
because sometimes the NOFs

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.810
are negative.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.190
Well, so that you understand it well.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.590
The sum of these two concepts is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.870
the real investment that a company

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.670
has to make.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.310
Therefore, we must learn to calculate

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.410
what the amount of NOFs

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.190
is.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.970
And it is very simple.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.710
We start from the situation balance

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.250
sheet and what we do is, in the current

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.410
asset, we will eliminate the effect

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.450
of some items that are financial,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.730
which are not operational.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.630
For example, if there are short-

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.210
term financial versions, which is very

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.670
common, what we do is to take them

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130
away because they are not really

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.390
needed for the operations of the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.870
company.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.950
Or if we have a treasury balance

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.710
with surpluses over the minimum

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.590
required box, we also take it away.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.630
And we are left with the necessary

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.170
parties to operate, which

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.390
are mainly two.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.370
It’s the stocks, the balance you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.310
have, the average balance you have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.050
in stocks, in the warehouse or wherever,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.750
and the customer salaries,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.150
that’s what your customers

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.810
owe you.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.950
For calculating NOFs, what we have

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.110
to do now is to take into account

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.070
spontaneous financing, which

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.970
is a concept that you should already

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030
understand because we have

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.070
seen it before.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.110
That is, what we will do is clean

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.750
up those operating assets, restore

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.090
the balance of suppliers because

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.370
the suppliers are helping

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.270
us to finance the company’

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.630
s operations.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.250
We can now calculate the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.370
NOCs.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.540
There are fewer customers and fewer suppliers.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.640
And that balance, that difference,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.440
is the permanent investment that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.200
a company must have to operate,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.640
which is directly related

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.320
to its operations or to its

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.640
economic activity.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.120
If we add the investment in fixed

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.460
assets, we already have the total

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.220
net investment that from the perspective

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.040
of the sources of financing,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.480
we already know the total

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.380
amount we have to finance.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.800
How is?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.660
Net debt or debt

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.660
claim.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.060
Because the rest, what is below,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.900
help us to finance it by

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.000
providers, is spontaneous

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.360
financing.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.140
The balance of NOFs is usually

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.120
positive.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.490
That is, customers plus stocks

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.130
is higher than the funding

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.890
granted by suppliers.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.930
This implies that that difference

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.970
to NOFs, well, because you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.630
have to get funding

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.830
to finance that net investment.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.590


00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.190
However, there are cases where this is not

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.990
the case.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.730
For example, in the large distributors

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.350
always set themselves as an

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.950
example.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.570
In which they pay their

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.810
suppliers 90 days, for

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.990
example, but charge customers

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.430
in cash.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.710
And what happens in this case

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.050
is that suppliers are helping

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.790
to finance the company’s operations.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.910
We see it in the balance sheet.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.670
When NOFs are negative, suppliers

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.470
are actually helping to finance

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.130
a portion of your investments

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.910
in fixed, fixed, or

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.790
non-current assets.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.630
So they are minimizing your financial

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.970
needs, they are minimizing the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.690
own funds you have to contribute

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.610
or they are minimizing

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.470
the liabilities, the debts

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.850
you have to apply for.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.650
Therefore, it is a much better scenario,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.690
but that is common, it is common

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.510
only in very few sectors.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.910
Next, what we will do is

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.230
to analyze what depends on

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.150
the operational needs of funds,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.610
what depends on these three

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.390
main parts, which are customers,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.850
stocks and suppliers.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.530
