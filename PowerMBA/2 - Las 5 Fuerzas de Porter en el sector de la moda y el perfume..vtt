WEBVTT

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.580
We will analyze profitability

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.760
in the fashion sector from the

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.560
perspective of Porter's 5 forces

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.420
or the forces that affect, in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.620
this case, that strong competitive

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.520
war.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.700
It is a very fragmented market, it

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.280
is a market in which the customer

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.640
has much decision-making power.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.440
To make you an idea, I will primarily

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.960
distinguish a little by sex,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.480
because women, when they go shopping,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200
have between 7 and 9 brands

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.960
in mind.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.400
There is a segmentation, I mean the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.760
woman who likes fashion, because

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
there are women who don't like

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.540
fashion, as in all, but between

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.320
7 and 9 brands.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.460
This means there is no very

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.460
big brand loyalty, usually,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.800
at least in fast fashion,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.140
and it has a lot of power.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.360
That's why prices have fallen so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.600
much, because this can be done.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.500
When there is no loyalty, competitive

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840
struggle is greater, the red ocean

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.960
is redder, there is greater price

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.440
war, the margins are ultra-adjusted.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.440
What is great for the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480
consumer, is great for us all.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.540
The behavior of man, and I mention

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.320
this because it is curious,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.740
is very different.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460
In the top of mind that it is called,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.540
it has around two brands, and usually

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.920
do not have to be two brands

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.700
for everything, but they can be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.200
by families, for example.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.040
You know you want to buy

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380
this shirt, usually you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.680
go to two places where you like

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960
them, or you buy the pants

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.680
in two places.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.900
This is quite common, but

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.200
women act differently, and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.100
this is a world where most

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.240
of the consumption is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.980
generated by women.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.200
What is the percentage?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.920
I can't tell you, because we

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.380
are, the market where I move

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.340
most is that of women,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.580
but it's majority without

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.000
any doubt.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.640
And I was referring to this because

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.460
in such a fragmented market and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.440
with such a great power of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040
the consumer, really customer

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.240
service has to be at the center.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.480
And you have to react very quickly

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.580
to what you ask, both at the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.380
level of price and fashion and trend.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.040
What makes the profitability

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.960
decrease is because the permanent

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.940
need for differentiation

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460
is greater, etc.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.360
From the consumer perspective

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.500
it is clear, in this case the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.820
force, has a lot of strength the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.300
consumer and this negatively

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.540
impacts on the profitability.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.720
If we talk about suppliers, for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.280
example, how would we value it?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240
I think big groups have a lot

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.660
of power over the provider,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.320
right?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.220
Totally, and despite being, as

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.320
we have said, has a relatively

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.680
small market share, its sales

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.880
are huge, its production

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.960
and volume capacities

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.480
are astronomical.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.620
And it's curious because there'

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.180
s an entry barrier for new brands

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.380
that are the minimum of production.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.000
To be able to set up an efficient

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.700
production chain in an Asian

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.080
producing country, for example,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.500
you need a minimum.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.140
Otherwise, they prefer their

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.980
chains with much higher volumes.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.240
This is a relatively important

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.160
small entry barrier

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.860
when it comes to generating

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.240
a new brand, which is our volumes.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.980
Because the price is so competitive

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.820
in the customer's end market, you either

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.720
start with high production

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.080
volumes, or it's very difficult.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.280
But really, that's surprising because

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.560
there are many young, specialized

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.140
brands born, right?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.780
They usually do not

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.840
compete in price.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.120
They are niche brands where you have a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520
very determined style, but they are

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.800
more expensive.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.780
Well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.500
Would it be impossible for them to compete

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.000
in price with Inditex?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.920
No, it is impossible.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.660
If you want to make money, it is very difficult.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.980
It is impossible, in fact.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.800
Well, you commented that there

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160
is another force that can negatively

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.920
affect you, that is being

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.240
carried some concentration in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.160
some of the providers.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.080
For example, in the transport

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.360
sector.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.760
What could be an example?

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.880
Yes, it's an example that is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.760
not, say, the fashion world affects,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.140
like many other costs, the cost

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.800
of transportation.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.080
And that, although it is not of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.960
the most relevant, in terms of the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.280
total cost of the position of the garment,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.540
which is a example of a counter-

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.100
position industry, that is, a super-

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.560
consolidated industry, which is in

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.420
this case of the shipping companies,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.800
which have also been consolidated

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.740
more recently, and which are making

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.860
that, for now, until now,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.180
the costs of transportation,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.280
especially from Asia by boat,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.480
were very low, they are still

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.480
low, but they are possible

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.020
to increase.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.060
I think, as an anecdote of an

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.120
entirely opposite industry, it is

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.840
quite acclaiming.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.260
But, of course, we have to work together,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.760
we are in a globalized world,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.400
and this is something that in the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
world of fashion is very relevant.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.660
The major brands we have talked

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.420
about, Inditex, Fast Retailing,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.100
Uniqlo, H&M, are global.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.360
They move well around the world,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.460
they have to use transportation in

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.980
many parts of the world, and they

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.280
have challenges of all kinds,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.880
political, social, customs...
