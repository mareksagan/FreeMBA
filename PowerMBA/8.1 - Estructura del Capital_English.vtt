00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.550
Capital structure is a very basic

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.090
concept of corporate finance

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.690
and finance that I think we should

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.070
understand well.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.330
The first thing we will do is

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.730
define the concept.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.170
What is the structure of capital?

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.510
Well, the structure of capital determines

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.910
how we will finance the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.550
company.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.530
The main factor is the proportion

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.910
of debt and debt.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.610
Here is a key ratio, which is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.710
the leverage ratio.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.470
The structure of capital

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.430
determines the leverage ratio.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.690
Why is this important?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.730
Why is the structure of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.670
capital important?

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.210
Because they have huge

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.870
implications on many things.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750
So look, on the profits in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.590
the income account because

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.250
we will pay taxes on cash

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.750
flows.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.550
The fact of obtaining debt or

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.110
not has major implications on cash

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.430
flows, entries, amortisations,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.890
etc.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.690
It has a huge implication in the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.150
risk it faces.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.490
In the risk of bankruptcy, for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.090
example, the fact of getting more

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.890
debt increases the risk.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.150
And above all, and most importantly,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.030
what we will see is that the capital

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.750
structure is determinant

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.010
of the company’s value and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.910
it is said that we must look

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.710
for an optimal capital structure

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.470
that maximizes the company’

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.150
s value.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.930
Let us review two key concepts.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.430
One is financial leverage.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.770
If we start from the assumption

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.830
that we obtain a profitability

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.210
higher than the cost of debt,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.870
the more we borrow, the greater

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.170
the profitability of our own funds.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.670
Second, the increase in debt leads

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.010
to an increase in costs.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.410
This we have to build on these

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.570
two concepts and we will see how

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.290
this affects the valuation of

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.970
the company.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.610
We will understand this very well with

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.370
this graph.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.190
As we see, the company’s

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.930
valuation increases as leverage

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.010
increases to a point that,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.050
as we see, the trend

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.130
is reversed.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.790
And we will understand it well.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.130
Things I want you to remember.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.750
Well, to start with,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.450
investors prefer to be leveraged.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.850
Why is?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.110
Because the fact that you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.390
are leveraged will increase

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.010
ROE, will increase the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.830
profitability of shareholders.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.070
And I can give you real examples

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.510
if you make a round and raise, for

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.950
example, two million euros.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.350
Funds or investors will prefer

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.590
that, in addition to those two

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.450
million equity, you can

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.030
access bank financing, for

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.110
example.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.210
Why is?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.750
The profitability of this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.530
equity will increase.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.930
We have shown this well in the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.910
course.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.490
The company’s rating is increasing.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.970
And if we thought of a perfect

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.770
world, as we have seen, the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.710
leverage ratio makes the profitability

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.670
of our own funds increase,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.990
because then what we would

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.470
have to do would be leverage

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.010
as much as possible.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.550
If we could reach 99% and that only

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.310
1% was equity, imagine the 3,000

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.630
euros of social capital, well,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.890
because in those circumstances

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.130
the profitability that own funds

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.230
get would be maximized because

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.210
they have put very little

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.150
money.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.770
But here comes another factor, and

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.910
that is the risk.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.010
This is very easy to understand too.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.330
How would you rate a company

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.450
that is up to 99%?

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.110
It would scare you a lot, right?

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.110
You will perceive a lot of fear, a lot of risk.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.350
This is to reduce the value

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.250
of the company.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.910
Why is?

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.890
Because investors demand very

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.730
high returns, the cost of capital

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.290
is very high in this case.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.050
That is pure common sense.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.650
But look, not only

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.430
investors, not only partners,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.570
but also debt providers,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.310
banks.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.510
If a bank has to lend money

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.590
to a company that is leveraged

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.830
to 99%, I don’t think it would first

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.190
lend it, but if it does, the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.030
risk is so high that the interest

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.970
rates it demands, that is, the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.050
cost of the debt would

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.830
also increase a lot.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.390
Therefore, as we see, the value

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.490
of the company increases,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.750
increases if you are leveraging

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.670
to a certain point, to a point

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.530
where you have exceeded,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.850
that is, a prudence criterion,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.050
which depends on each of the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.590
sectors.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.790
There are sectors where you can

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.970
leverage more than others, because

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.130
you have more stable cash flows,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.110
because it is a business with

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.130
less risk, etc.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.290
And as we exceed that limit,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.190
that range, in which we

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.530
are taking excessive risks,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.030
the company’s value

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.150
will decrease.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.030
Why is?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.870
Both the debt providers and the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.450
debt partners will be penalized.
