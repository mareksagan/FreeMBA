00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.040
I would like to talk about

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.960
the partnership.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.140
The partners’ pact is a word that comes

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.400
out very much and has a lot of

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.860
sense, but that the non-experts

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.580
seem to make it difficult for

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580
us to understand all the depth it has.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.280
First, explain what it is, what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.160
it is for and why you recommend it.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.840
The first thing to say about the

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.000
contract is that it is a contract.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.460
People often confuse it with

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.020
a decision of the board.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.420
No, it is a contract in which

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.720
we sit as partners of the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.560
company, to which we will be

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080
partners and we agree on how we

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.300
will organize ourselves, how

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
we will make decisions, who

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380
will be the manager of the company.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.540
There are a number of points that are

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.120
critical, they are very important in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.560
the face of the company’s life and then

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.500
we regulate it in a document that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.860
is outside of the examinations and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.220
outside of the acts of the board

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.100
and committee and that kind of things.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.620
So, the partners’ agreement is as

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.640
such, they will always bring us

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.460
the questions what is the moment

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.980
when my answer is always the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.180
same and is that at the same time

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
you sign the constitution

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340
writing of your company, when

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.500
you sit with your partner and look

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.560
him in the eyes for the first

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.620
time and say, this company

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.660
how will it be?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.100
This is the time to make the pact.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.700
There are uncomfortable questions, it’

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.480
s like when you marry someone.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.400
There are things you need to know

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.340
about someone else, right?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760
There is one aspect that I like very much.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.980
Yes, when you marry someone,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.900
we have given you the example

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
once, that the partners’ pact has

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.600
to face it, but that sometimes

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.520
when you start a relationship

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.820
these things are not usually

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460
done and separation

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.580
of property or profits.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.800
It seems that if you don’

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.020
t talk about it then you end up

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.300
in trouble.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.360
We want to have children, we don’t want to

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.720
have children.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.740
We want to live in the city or in the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.200
mountains.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.680
Yes, that is exactly.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.060
This concept of hidden agenda, which

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.400
are hidden agendas.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400
These are things you don’t hide from your

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.040
partners because you want to be a fucker.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.640
The hidden agenda?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.200
What is that?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.300
Yes, it’s a concept that helped

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.320
me a lot to understand the partners’

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.460
pact and that’s what we

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.780
were saying.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.920
These are things that you have in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.660
your head, that you don’t share with

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.860
your partners, that can be

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.520
very relevant, but you’re not hiding them.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.360
We are simply talking

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.040
about them.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.900
It is not a matter of bad faith, it

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.800
is a matter of simply lack of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800
communication at the beginning.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.120
Are they like your interests?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.980
Yes, they are your interests.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.280
For example, a company, what do

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.100
we want to do with this company?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.200
Do we want to sell it or do we want

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.320
to stay in it for the rest of our lives?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.200
Do you want to have 10 employees or a million?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.160
Do we want to make an investment?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.280
We do not want to make investments.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.960
Is it a full time project or is it a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.460
side project?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.480
Sorry for the words in English, but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.480
it’s that they’re used at the end

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.440
of the day when you put yourself

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.700
with your partners, sit down, measure

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.320
your face and say guys we’ll

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.000
decide what we’ll do with this.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.740
And that eventually gives it a little

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.180
shape and ends up materializing into

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.860
a partnership.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.280
No, because it is very possible

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.840
that the interests of the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.540
different people who found

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.960
a company do not have to coincide.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.840
One thing everyone wants is that.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.840
There is no clause of a partnership

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.400
agreement to work for the company.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.140
And the partnership helps that,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.340
helps establish from the very beginning

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.060
and let people face what their

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.600
responsibilities will be.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.260
Exactly, and especially who

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.920
will be able to appoint a board

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.580
member, for example,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.000
or who will be solidary

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.700
or single or mancomunated

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.240
friendship or whatever.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.700
We have defined it at a time and so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.860
we don’t have to discuss it every time.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.400
We have it from now on.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.580
Who will go to the round?

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.320
There are many decisions that are

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.740
difficult or are a little that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.600
can get you the colors at a certain

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.060
time, because it is better to

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.300
do everything off the road, regulate

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.600
it and from there then it is

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.160
all much easier.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.580
Well, I think it is clear to us

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.860
in general what a partnership

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.880
is and what it serves to.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400
Basically what you need to take

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.600
into account is that in a relationship

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.200
of this type of business, which

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.520
is also often between people

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.380
who are friends initially and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.720
still things like, sometimes even

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.960
couples, come up well or wrong,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.180
many tensions arise in the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.620
way and then on top of other

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.720
investors, other partners, etc.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.980
The ideal and your recommendation

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.180
is from the first day to face

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.440
it, leave things in writing, that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.820
everyone has clear what their

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.980
obligations are, what their

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.020
interests are, etc.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
and perfect.
