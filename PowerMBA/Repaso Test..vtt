00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.210
These are the basic questions that

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.630
you have probably answered well.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.270
These blocks are customer segments,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.250
distribution channels,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.570
value proposition and customer

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.390
relationships.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.030
This whole part of the canvas,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.390
the right part, what does it refer to?

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.550
It is about customers and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.290
the market.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.910
If we were talking about the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.990
left side, it refers to the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.510
infrastructure, what you need,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.750
the resources you need to

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.790
provide that value proposal

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.030
to those customer segments.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.330


00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.510
What is this block?

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.020
Key resources, revenue and

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.680
main costs.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.200
We will draw a printing model.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.860
The customers are mainly

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.240
small local, etc.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.280
What are we referring to?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880
of course to the customer segments.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.360
It has four business managers who

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.020
are responsible for capturing

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.440
and managing customers.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.080
We are describing part of the distribution

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.060
channels of how the print

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.220
reaches its customers.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.220
It offers printing services, it

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.860
is the value proposition of a print.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.520
Close relationships with customers

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.280
are established.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.980
We are describing how relationships

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.080
with customers are.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.500
Machinery, local, stock, which are

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.040
key resources that are needed.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.440
Manage customer relationships

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.760
and manage revenue processes.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.500


00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.300
The agreement with the paper

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.520
provider is a strategic alliance.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.200
Sales team salaries and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.100
salaries, we are describing

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.820
what are one of the main

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.260
cost parties.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.100
Renting the machine is another

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.220
of the parties.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.440
Income by project and service,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.920
we are describing how the revenue

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.320
flows are.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.200
Is the business force of a company

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800
a direct channel or is it indirect?

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.500
It is a direct channel,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.180
exchange costs generate

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.440
entry barriers to boost

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.480
competitors.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.600
Do social media benefits from

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.320
high or low exchange costs?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.100
These are usually high exchange costs.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.520
Which business models

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.580
benefit from higher exchange

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.140
costs?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.480
A restaurant, a tax advisor, a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.320
hairdresser.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.020
Among them, the tax counsel.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.780
Changing a tax advisor is

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.640
more complicated than

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.900
changing a restaurant that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.100
has no cost of change or

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.780
a hairdresser.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.700
Of the following business models,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.000
which does not have a recurring

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.920
income model?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.600
The gym has a recurring

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.120
model, Netflix too, a car

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.960
sharing workshop not

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.740
and a tax advice yes

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.140
because it pays a quota.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.380
The answer is the workshop.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.700
Select the analysis that does

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.420
not correspond to a gym.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.700
Is there a geographical

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.320
barrier?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.800
Yes, because when you have

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.840
a gym you are generating

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
an entry barrier around,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.620
you are discouraging competitors

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.000
to place a gym

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.660
nearby.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
Is it a scalable model?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.560
No to.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.580
And are the revenue, expenses and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.300
cash flow stable and easy to foresee?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.600
and yes.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.060
It is not a scalable model.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.540
What is the product standardization

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.140
for?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.280
The income is more

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.740
recurrent or more scalable.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.980
To be more scalable?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.400
You don't have to adapt the product

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.740
when you grow up.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.280
How do social media monetize

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.140
users?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.780
With advertisers, as it mainly

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.480
does Facebook, in some cases

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.700
through recurring quotas such

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.160
as on LinkedIn, for example, in

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.180
freemium quotas or in some cases

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.120
with freemium services

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.280
that are punctual.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.660
Well, because they are all correct.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.340
We find social networks that

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.380
have these three monetization formulas.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220
indirect distribution channels.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.380
The channel allows you.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.740
We have to choose which option

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.260
is wrong.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.840
It allows you to grow faster.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.540
It allows you to benefit from

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.920
the know-how of your distributors.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.860
Does it allow you to better manage

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.880
the customer experience?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.120
No to.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.480
In fact, when you sell through

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.100
an indirect channel, you are losing

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.500
contact with the customer.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.100
It is one of the disadvantages and allows

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.180
you to be more flexible.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.320
Well, the option is to better

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.860
manage the customer experience.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.070
A restaurant is a small business.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.490
Why is?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.270
The resources you need to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.850
provide the service are very few.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.210
You need a local, you need

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.650
waiters, cooks, etc.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.350
Their market is limited.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.550
Your own market, your

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.130
own market.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.910
And you also have to make

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.310
strong investments or additional

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.570
investments to grow, because if

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.070
you want to grow a lot, you have

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.010
to build other restaurants

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.410
or expand the local.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.650
So they are all correct.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.690
What are the disadvantages of the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.190
companies we have called owners?

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.890
That they are petty, that the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.870
company is not attractive to

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.770
investors, that their valuation

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.290
will hardly grow.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.410
Because, of course, it depends so much on

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.650
the owner that they are not companies

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.790
that come to value a lot of money.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.250
All are correct.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.730
In premium models, the percentage

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.210
of premium users is usually

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.070
how much?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.690
More than a 70, between a 20 and a 70?

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.830
It is usually very low,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.970
below 20.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.890
What does this business model correspond to?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.470
Are you looking for a marketplace

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.650
or an e-commerce site?

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.470
Well, it is important to keep in mind

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.290
that you have to buy and that you

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.330
also have to stock.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.550
Costs are a variable of purchases.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.070


00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.890
It is clearly an e-commerce.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.930
In a marketplace, you usually

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.350
don't have to stock

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.810
or buy.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.470
You are linking supply with

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.210
demand.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.210
This is an e-commerce.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.910
What business model

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.690
does it not fit for?

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.390
Let us see.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.370
We have the option of Facebook, social

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.790
network, a digital newspaper and

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.250
Zalando, which is an e-commerce or

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.230
fashion marketplace.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.110
Let's look at the business model.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.250
We have customer service,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.370
we have millions of users

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.070
and we have advertisers.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.170
What is the value proposal

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.170
we make to advertisers?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.950
Well, then the data and attention

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.110
of those millions of users

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.370
and how we make money through

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.530
advertising.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.150
Zalando, which we have said is an

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.670
e-commerce, a fashion marketplace,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.470
does not make money through advertising.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.230


00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.670
Their main source of income is not

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.970
that.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.890
This could never be the

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.670
business model of Zalando.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.960
And following the same model, to

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.800
what pattern belongs what we

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.380
are seeing?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.300
A free pattern in which we

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.180
give a free service to millions

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.180
of users and what we do is

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.740
win Good, because what we are

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.800
seeing here is the pattern

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.380
of a free or advertising

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.700
business model, we could call

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.580
it too.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.780
We will analyze this.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.020
We are seeing that the distribution

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.180
channel are millions of people

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.500
and also influencers.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.520
And we have a cost that is

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.820
the commission for the sale, that

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.300
is, for each of the sales we

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.440
make, we have to pay this people,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.920
which is a subscription

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.520
model, not a pyramid of affiliates.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.420
It seems like a pyramid

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.240
of affiliates.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.040
It seems that we are using

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.320
millions of people as

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.780
affiliates as a distribution

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.780
channel to boost our

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.020
sales.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.460
Now let us ask a series of questions

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.300
relating to one of the cases

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.300
we have seen.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.760
Spotify combines two sources of revenue.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.460
A percentage of its users pay premium

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.340
fees and, in addition, what

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.440
it does is monetize those who

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.700
do not pay the one Spotify

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.280
faces, which is to convert

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.320
users free into pay users or

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.780
is to monetize users free.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.720
Well, monetizing free users

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.700
is relatively easy, therefore,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.860
because it does with

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.500
advertisers.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.500
The challenge is that the percentage

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.660
of users who do not pay, that is,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.520
who pay, increase.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.160
What did Alvaro tell us?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.400
Account Plus revolutionized the software

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.580
sector by bringing innovation

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.820
to the business model that

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.800
affected what?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.280
To the customer segments a much

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.080
simpler, much more standardized

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.720
product than you, therefore,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.960
the value proposal changes,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.260
which allows you to target

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.280
a new customer segment.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:12.640
Why is?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.860
to smaller customers.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.700
And what did Ritchie tell

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.040
us about innovation in Vintail'

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.140
s business model?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.540
How can they grow in a mature

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.840
sector like that cave sector?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.640
What they did, what they do is

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.840
innovate in the key resources

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.580
that are needed and what they

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.760
do is rely on other cellars

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.080
that become manufacturers

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.240
or almost suppliers.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.520
Therefore, innovate in key

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.840
resources by not relying on

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.280
immobilized to grow.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220
For Fast Fashion companies,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.420
such as Inditex or Mango,

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.100
what did Nestor Hub tell us?

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.700
The digital channel that generates

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.080
greater or smaller margins.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.800
Well, he told us that something

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.200
surprisingly surprising generates

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.460
smaller margins due, among

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.600
other things, to the high

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.020
percentage of returns.
