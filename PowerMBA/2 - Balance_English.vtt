WEBVTT

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.480
Today we will see the outcome.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.140
The balance sheet is the basis of

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.180
all accounting records, so you

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.420
need to be in a very important

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.620
class and you need to understand

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.520
it very well.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.280
I have already commented on you earlier

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.580
in the introduction to the course

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.660
of accounting that accounting really

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.080
isn’t difficult, in fact it’

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.300
s quite interesting.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.500
But we have to build on a solid

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.620
foundation and, as I said,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.840
balance is a key piece.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.400
Today, we have two goals.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.640
First I want you to understand

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.100
perfectly what a situation balance sheet

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.680
is and what it reflects and how

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.780
it is structured.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.540
And you should also be able to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.980
place the accounts, the different accounts

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.260
in each of the blocks within the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.120
balance sheet.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.360
We will then do exercises

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.580
to reinforce these concepts

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.900
because it may be a

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.720
bit complex at first.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.510
Well, the balance sheet informs

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.930
us of the patrimonial situation

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.730
of a company, mainly what it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.810
has and what it owes at a specific time.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.370
It is like taking a photo of a

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.070
company and in that photo what

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.470
it tells us is its patrimonial

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.850
situation at that time.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.310
And before I go into detail on how

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.850
the balance sheet is structured, I

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.010
want you to understand the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.310
implication of what I have said

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.030
at a particular time.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.150
This is what we call a variable

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.250
stock.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.190
There are variables that are flow

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.010
like the state or the result

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.710
account, the treasury, which

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.790
they do is to represent what has

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.230
happened over a period of time.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.290
In the balance we do, however,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.690
is to take the picture.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.110
We are representing the situation

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.250
at a specific moment.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.190
I have given these two examples.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.730
A flow variable, for example,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.010
would be the water that has come

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.590
out during the tap over a period

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.290
of one year, imagine.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.230
And instead the balance would be like

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.170
a bath the level of water that is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.290
at a certain moment.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.670
We will build a balance sheet and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.050
then we will understand

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.030
the meaning of each of the parties.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.170
The first thing you have to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.630
understand is that the balance has

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.090
two blocks, the right and the left.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.530
On the right side, what we do

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.170
is reflect the origins, that is,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.730
how we have funded ourselves.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.870
This is the source of the funds.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.850
What the balance sheet on the right

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.970
side comes to say is where the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.870
funds we have obtained come from.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.650
And on the left side it tells us

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.330
where we have invested, what the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.870
application has been, the destination

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.850
of those funds we have obtained.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.460
It has three main blocks.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.380
The origins of the fund are

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.120
net assets, which is basically

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.620
what belongs to the partners, the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.700
liabilities, which are debts, and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.380
on the left side the destinations

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.600
of the investment are the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.000
assets, the goods and rights

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.380
that we have acquired with

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.040
the funds that we have obtained

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.540
from both partners and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.100
debts.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.820
Let’s go now with the detailed

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.280
analysis of each block so you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280
can identify or understand

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.540
what kind of accounts go

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.080
within each of the blocks.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.360
Originally when a company is created

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.040
what partners do is to contribute

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.160
money, then we would

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.440
be talking that net assets

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.640
would be the social capital.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.520
As the company enters into

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.820
operation, profits or losses

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.600
are generated that increase

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.580
or decrease the net

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.140
asset.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240
I want you to remember that there

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.540
is a account called unshared profits

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.840
to which we carry the balance

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.020
of net profits that have not been

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.100
distributed as dividends

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.980
and that are left within the company,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.340
so they are making increase

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000
year by year, in the case that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.260
there is no-shared profits,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.280
the balance of net

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.480
assets.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.780
And lastly, with regard to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.000
net assets, you have to understand

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.340
that it is an obligation that the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.960
company has with its partners,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.580
but it does not really have a

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.520
return period nor have interests

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.180
been generated.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.300
And this is the difference with

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.820
liabilities, which well does not

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.000
need to go into much detail with

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.040
liabilities, liabilities are

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.280
the debts we have with third

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.760
parties that can be debts either

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.300
long-term or short-term.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.160
And there is another part that

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.620
I want you to understand well and is

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.460
the part of suppliers.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.900
Net assets and liabilities are

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.720
mainly financial

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.620
concepts, they are representative

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.580
concepts of the funds we

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.180
have obtained to finance

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.620
the activity.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.200
Instead there is a part that is

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.460
the part of suppliers that is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.000
a purely operational part.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.060
A supplier balance is generated

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.320
when you make a purchase from

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.740
a supplier but do not pay the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.580
bill, and a debt is generated

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.020
temporarily during that

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.120
payment period that you have

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.940
with the supplier and

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.300
that balance goes to the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.540
supplier account.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.200
Let’s look at the assets.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.820
Assets are all assets and rights

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.840
that are owned or controlled

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.280
by the company.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.020
The goods are very obvious and can

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.820
be of very different types.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.520
You have machinery, buildings, real

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.720
estate, patents, you have the web,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.820
you have tangible assets and also

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.160
some are intangible like these

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.560
I have commented on.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.420
There are financial investments

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.080
and in the event that you have

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.780
made it active, as the stocks,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.600
the box we have at this time, etc.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.000
I have said that assets are

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.360
goods and rights, that is,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.280
also the debt rights, the debts

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280
that third parties have with

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.540
us such as the customer account

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.280
because it is also an

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.840
asset.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.440
I want you to consider the customer

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440
account as well as

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.900
the supplier account because

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.180
we will see them on numerous

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.260
occasions.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.100
The customer account reflects the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.400
balance that customers who have

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.780
not paid us on account owe us.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.540
There are two operational and circulating

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.960
accounts that are very important

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960
and we will have to understand

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.160
well that they are accounts

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600
to be charged like that of

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.780
customers we have already seen and stocks.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.200
Stocks are goods or products

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.640
that we did not sell at the

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.940
time of the balance sheet

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.820
and remain within the company.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.580


00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.700
Previously, we saw that liabilities

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.940
are mainly financial-character

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.200
items, that is, what we get

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.660
with liabilities is to obtain

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.100
the financial resources necessary

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.520
to finance the asset.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.160
In the case of assets it is

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.440
usually the opposite but there

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.700
is some part such as financial

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.760
investments that we have been

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.800
able to make or cash that are

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.860
purely financial, are not

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.340
directly related to the operation

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.800
of the company.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.700
Well here I leave you to finish

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.900
a structure of the balance sheet,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.960
the structure recommended

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.340
by almost all regulations or

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.960
general accounting plans in which

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.920
we classify assets into non-current

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.280
assets and current assets,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.640
formerly called fixed and circulating

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.640
and the liabilities equal,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.760
non-current liabilities

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.140
and current liabilities,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.620
but this we will see in

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.680
detail in the next class.
