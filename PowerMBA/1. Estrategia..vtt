WEBVTT

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.890
We should, from now on, be experts

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.150
analyzing business models.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.350
We will not review the business model

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.270
canvas because you are sure to control

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.130
it to the perfection.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.650
What we will do is look at

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.770
what factors we should

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.830
analyze or keep in mind whenever

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.230
we think about a business

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.510
model.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.510
We should think so.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.750
Is it a big market?

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.930
Is the size of the market

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.470
large?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.330
The bigger the more interesting.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.770
Is it scalable?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.490
That is something we will see later.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.050
Are there entrance barriers that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.890
make the value of the business model

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.670
greater because we are making

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.110
it difficult for competitors to enter?

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.170
Do we bring value?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.410
This is probably one of the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.490
main questions I have.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.190
It is always the first thing I do

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.210
because this is conditional

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.150
You have to be very clear that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.350
you are bringing value, that you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.070
are solving a real problem that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.010
customers have, that customers

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.930
are willing to pay, etc.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.230
The question is, are there

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.290
any exchange costs?

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.530
Customers have difficulty

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.390
changing suppliers.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.270
If you get that there are exchange costs

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.010
you will have more recurring customers

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.130
and your business will be worth more.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.930
The income?

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.170
What should we first think

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.330
about with income?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.430
What analysis should we do?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.890
If they are recurring.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Now everyone seems to look for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.350
recurring income, which generates

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890
security, because it makes you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.430
able to project with less risk

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.350
what will happen in the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.230
coming periods.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.810
Has there been a disruption in costs?

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.270
Is it that the business model has

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030
generated any innovation that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.450
allows costs to be much lower

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.550
than the competition?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.490
It is always interesting to analyze

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.230
how a business' cash flow is.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.730
There are that have a very sound

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.390
positive cash flow in which they

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.330
are permanently generating

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.450
treasury, do not need

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.290
financing, etc.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.550
Instead, there are other business

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.810
models that do it to consume

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.130
treasury, especially initially.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.230
The need for funding

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.430
will be

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.850
greater.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.770
Another basic question you have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.230
to ask yourself when you talk,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.230
when you think about a company,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.390
is what are the margins?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.210
Are we talking about a business

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.330
with very small margins that needs

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.170
to bill a lot of money to earn

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.230
something?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.550
One of the key analysis factors

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.590
we've spent a lot of

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.110
time on is scalability.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.970
This is a very important concept that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.050
is now in everyone's mouth.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.590
Why is it?

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.790
Because scalable have more

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.390
potential, they are companies that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.090
higher valuations, they are the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.850
companies that are

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.230
preferred by investors.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.430
Remember, we talked

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.350
about the problem facing

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.770
many small business

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.730
owners.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.370
These are companies that will not scale

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.710
because they depend entirely on the owner.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.190
So imagine, let's think of a doctor

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.050
selling his hours or a psychologist

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.730
or a consultant whose entire

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.170
business generation, for example,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.130
depends on the partner,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.890
CEO or whatever.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.110
All these companies are ownership companies

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.830
and are companies that are not scalable

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.710
and are companies that if they do not

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.970
evolve their business model, they

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.710
will never come to have value because

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.190
if the owner is not, the company

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.490
does not generate.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.850
If we analyze scalability from

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.470
a technical point of view, the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.610
orthodox definition is that it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.070
is a model that is able to generate,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.570
is able to grow in income

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.910
while costs or investments

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.930
do not grow proportionately.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.170
What is really very valuable is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.830
understanding what makes a business

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.210
scalable because only in

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.610
this way can we evolve

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.030
business models looking

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.570
for scalability.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.530
And well, what we did is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.810
identify four factors or four

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.530
requirements.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.450
First, the market has to be very large.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.330
If the market is not big you won't

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.470
be able to grow much.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.990
Two, the distribution channels

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.250
or the channels through which

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.970
you grow must be scalable.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.570
The most obvious is the internet.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.730
You can sell from your home to

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.950
anywhere.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.350
Another key aspect is the supply.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.650
The standardized offer.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.770
What do I mean by this?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350
If you grow and need to

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.950
adapt a lot, for example,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.110
your product or service in each

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.530
of the markets you are in, your

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.250
scalability will be lower because

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.430
you will need permanent

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.290
investments, product

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.110
adaptations, product

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.090
developments, etc.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.150
I go to the other extreme.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.190
Imagine that you create a

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.530
product, we think of a software,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.910
an application, I don't know, and

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.950
that you can grow around the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.430
world without having to adapt

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.810
absolutely anything.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.530
Well, then you are much more scalable.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.870
The last criterion is resources.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.590


00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.610
The resources you need in your

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.390
business model.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.590
What is what you need?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.810
Imagine your business is very

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.910
people-intensive.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.810
People are not scalable.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.770
As you grow up, you'll

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.590
need to hire more people,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.810
so the cost curve will

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.490
continue to grow.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.990
But we go to the opposite,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.810
we are almost not in need

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.050
of people and what we need is

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.130
a technology that can be

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.150
used by as much a million

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.090
people as one.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.650
In this case, the resource

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.150
is much more scalable.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.110
We can grow a lot, but the cost

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.750
curve or the investment curve,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.710
which is not the same, obviously,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.050
will follow more or less

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.810
flat.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.030
One of the business models

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.210
we study most deeply is

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.150
platforms.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.690
Why is it?

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.030
For many things, because platforms

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.010
are that are revolutionizing

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.170
almost every sector, because

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.390
they have many advantages and

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.890
because the implications

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.510
in management are huge.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.320
The most important or the main

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.500
implication we have seen in

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.480
platforms with regard to

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.140
linear and what makes it different

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.600
is the network effect, is the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.860
network effect that basically

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.000
is that on a platform

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.820
what happens is that as there

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.960
are more users or that users

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.520
use more the platform,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.460
more value is generated

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.480
for all users.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.640
It is a virtuous circle.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.060
More users, more value, more

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.880
users, more value.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.500
Or we can also see it from another

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.620
perspective and it is a vicious circle.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.820
If you have fewer users than your competitor

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.220
or do not have users, you do not generate

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.920
value and will make it impossible

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.220
for you to grow.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.940
What is the consequence of all this?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.600
This is what is called the Winner

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.680
Takes It All effect.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.160
It is that monopolies are generated,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.300
because the companies that grow most

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.220
generate huge barriers to entry,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.440
the platforms that grow most

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.060
and that makes them very

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.300
valuable companies.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.320
Come compete now, for example,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.080
with idealist or with photocasa

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080
in Spain, which are the real estate

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.680
companies that add almost all

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.400
the supply and almost all the demand.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240
Try to compete with it from scratch.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.760
Of course, as you don't have users on

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.780
either side, you'll never be able

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.840
to grow because you don't generate

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.100
value to either side, you don't

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.060
take traction, you don't take momentum.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.840
What is very important is that

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.160
we understand that platforms are

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.600
different as a business model

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.460
from linear and that, therefore,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.440
management is very different.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.140
In a linear business, what you have

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.480
is to provide value to your

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.640
customers in a linear way.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.840
On a platform, that is not the case.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.740
You do what you do is create

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.420
the environment within which the

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.000
platform is and within which users,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.300
who are sometimes supply and demand

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.300
in a marketplace or the users of

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.440
an application, for example,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.320
generate value among themselves.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.420
You have to encourage that value

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.020
is generated.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.700
You can do this in many ways, healing

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.860
information, making everything

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.380
more accessible.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.400
Well, in many ways.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.160
Another of the implications

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.140
that platforms have is that the

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.340
growth strategy is different,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.560
because you have to work

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.680
on both sides of the platform.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.800
Imagine it is a marketplace.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.000
You have to capture both supply

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.440
and demand.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.160
Instead, when your business is

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.200
linear, the only thing you have to

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.920
do is capture customers on one side

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.640
of the two.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.060
But well, the important thing is that

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.280
you understand the differences,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.080
that you understand what

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.660
a platform is, that you understand

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.360
the difference with a linear business,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.300
basically to avoid the mistake

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.400
of managing the platforms as if

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.240
they were linear business.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.420
To understand competitive

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.860
strategies, we will primarily

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.300
rely on two tools.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.960
The first is the value curve.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.220
It is a very simple tool that

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.240
allows us to understand well

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.660
what competitors are

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.840
investing in, what the industry

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.780
is offering, what we do,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.440
what is our differentiation,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.820
what we are better in,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.660
what we are worse in, etc.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.440
The other of the tools or models

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.900
is the matrix of Michael Porter's

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.280
generic strategies, which

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.320
is something you have to understand

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.980
well.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.840
This is the basis of the strategy.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.820
We know that there are two dimensions

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.120
or two bridges.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.020
One of them is what is the source

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.260
of competitive advantage.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.560
Businesses, basically, what Porter

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.640
tells us is that they have to choose

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.360
between differentiation or

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.240
cost leadership.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.800
They have to choose between

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.420
being better, for which

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.580
they will usually have to invest

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.580
more, or they have to choose to

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.260
be more efficient in their operations,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.640
in their costs, which will allow

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.020
them to be cheaper or have the

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.380
same price as competitors, but

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.160
earning more money with

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.840
higher margins.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.180
You can reinvest those

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.380
margins in marketing, etc., and

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400
eventually you grow.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.700
And the other dimension is that

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.520
we have to choose to address

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.540
the entire sector, or we have

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.600
to choose to specialize

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.060
in a niche, in a specific

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.560
segment.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.380
Well, because from these two dimensions,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.260
what we see is that there are

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.320
three or four, depending on

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.200
who says it, generic strategies.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.820
Differentiation and cost leadership,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.760
and then we have segmentation

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.560
or niche, which we could also

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.580
divide into specialized

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.840
in differentiation and specialized

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.720
in cost.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.960
By the way, the advantage of segmentation

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.060
or looking for the niche is that

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.280
what you do is, you know much better

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.080
than your competitors that particular

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.840
segment, in which you become

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.680
unbeatable, establish better

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.740
relationships with customers,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.540
etc.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.440
This is a very convenient

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.460
strategy in many occasions,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.800
especially in small.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.720
There are great opportunities to

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.600
specialize a lot, because the

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.720
big competitors are not able

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.000
to serve that niche like

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.580
you.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.330
Because it is very important to

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.590
understand Michael Porter's

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.330
generic strategies, because we

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.450
have to have very clear what

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.870
our strategy, our competitive

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.210
strategy, our generic strategy is.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.810
Keep in mind that the

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.990
implications that the management of

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.770
the entire company has are huge.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.430
That is, the difference between

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.830
choosing differentiation, that you

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.210
have to permanently look for value,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.550
that you are bought for being

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.590
better, etc.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.690
Or choose cost leadership, where

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.310
what you oppose is to be more

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.690
efficient in each of the

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.930
chain links to increase

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.850
the margins or to reduce

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.070
prices, because of course,

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.390
the management of the

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.210
company is totally

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.190
different, you need

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.130
different profiles, etc.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.550
The risk here I would say are the

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.050
companies that don't know very

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.270
well what they are playing.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.430
And in the end they are not even better,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.370
the customer does not perceive

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.810
the differentiation, but they are

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.250
not more cost efficient, etc.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.630
They are left on no-one's land and ultimately

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.070
what they do is generate competitive

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.010
disadvantages.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.270
Well, what we have done is, thanks

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.910
to the Blue Ocean strategy, we

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.090
have learned to overcome this

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.790
concept.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.550
We have learned, remember Porter

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.070
tells us, you have to choose between

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.690
being, between differentiation,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.990
between being better, which

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.050
always brings in with greater

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.250
investments.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.450
For example, a restaurant

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.050
You want to be a better restaurant

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.570
than your competitor.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.350
What is what you do?

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.410
You put yourself in a prime area with

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.430
more expensive rentals, hire

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.550
a better chef, that is, more higher

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.130
costs, or make a greater investment

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.450
in having a local, because that,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.030
of higher level.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.010
Differentiation usually

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.250
brings more investment.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.770
And on the other hand, we have, or so,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.870
leadership in cost.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.090
Well, because what the Blue Ocean

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.850
strategy tells us is that what we

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.410
can do is look for innovation in

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.010
value, which is simultaneously

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.730
generating more value at a

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.250
lower cost.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.570
And as I tell you, it may sound

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.830
easy, but it's really breaking

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.030
up with absolutely everything

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.590
we've learned today with traditional

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.190
strategic thinking.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.210
Well, the Blue Ocean strategy,

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.850
what helps us is to do so.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.870
It gives us tools.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.730
We saw the rice matrix.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.910
The RICE matrix, what helps us

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.090
is what we do, we start from

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.210
the industry's value curve and

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.250
what we're going to do is

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.090
invest strongly.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.750
We will raise the value curve

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.210
to offer more value.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.530
For what we will have to do

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.850
is increase and create in some

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.250
of the factors, invest strongly

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.250
along with what we do is

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.010
reduce enormously, de-invest

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.070
in other factors.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.830
In some cases, they are eliminated.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.010
In the end, what we get is a completely

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.210
different value curve.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.190
And if we do so and that value

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.390
curve convinces a segment

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.470
of customers, well, because we

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.490
have generated our Blue Ocean.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.110
We always recommend companies

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.590
who think this way, that they

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.870
look for their Blue Ocean.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.230
There are really few companies that

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.690
create a Blue Ocean starting from all

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.550
the requirements we have said,

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.510
but it helps a lot to innovate.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.990
You have to be constantly thinking

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.630
like this, forgetting what others

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.050
are doing, being brave,

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.270
reducing in some of the factors,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.670
creating others, seeking

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.490
differentiation in this way.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.110
And if you get it, if you believe

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.530
your Blue Ocean, what you're going to

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.850
get out is that Red Ocean in which they're

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.730
all doing the same thing,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.210
with low margins, copying, etc.,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.590
and what you're going to do is grow

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.950
a lot, your margins to

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.450
be bigger, etc.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.730
We have seen several examples

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.170
of Blue Oceans, the one that always

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.250
comes up, that is spoken in the

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.730
book, etc., is the Circo del Sol,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.810
but we have seen closer cases

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.090
like the Plus Account, for example,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.690
of Álvaro, or we at The

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.430
Power MBA.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.350
As companies grow, it is very important

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.570
to understand a number of concepts

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.170
or models.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.370
The first is the Ansov matrix.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.290


00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.650
It is a matrix that helps us visualize

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.190
what are the growth options we have,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.530
and it always applies, that

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.070
is the good thing about this matrix,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.250
which is very simple and applies

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.370
in all cases.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.130
What Ansov tells us is that

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.630
we can grow in two dimensions, we

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.990
can grow in products, and

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.210
we can grow in markets.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.750
And from these two

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.950
dimensions, what we have

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.750
is four growth strategies.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.030
We have market penetration,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.530
what we do is, we're going to grow

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.650
in the market we're in, and with

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.270
our current products, it's the

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.090
one that has the least risk.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.510
We can choose to develop

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.970
new products within

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.090
the market we are in.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.370
And this has a little more

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.090
risk, because, well, we don't know

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.370
if customers will see value,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.590
if they will buy us, etc.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.170
Or we can choose to develop markets,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.090
that is, with the products

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.710
we have, we go to other markets,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.510
whether they are other segments

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.950
or geographic market development.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.990
Here, for example, we can see the

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.350
Power MBA growth strategy

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.790
in the United States, for example.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.490
This is a disruption of market development.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.950
And finally, we have the

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.950
growth strategy that has the

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.070
greatest risk, which is diversification.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.110
Because we are moving as far away

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.430
as possible from our current business,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.430
into new markets and new products.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.670
Another basic concept you have

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.730
to understand is the difference

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.670
between organic growth

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.930
and inorganic growth.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.650
Organic growth is when you

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.190
grow with your own resources.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.590
And inorganic growth occurs when

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.990
what you do is a merger, an acquisition,

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.270
a joint venture, or an

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.150
alliance with a third party.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.370
Each option has

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.330
its advantages and

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.650
disadvantages.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.310
It will be applicable in different scenarios.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.670
If what you want, for example, is

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.010
to grow very fast, imagine you

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.890
want to do a very fast international

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.510
expansion.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.210
You are heavily capitalized.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.290
How will it be easier?

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.430
Grow with your own resources,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.070
have delegations in each of the

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.850
countries, or what you do is

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.070
acquire or do a joint venture

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.450
or whatever with local

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.810
companies.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.070
Well, it is obvious that in

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.510
this case we will grow faster

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.930
if we opt for inorganic

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:02.850
growth.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.430
But it also brings greater

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.170
risks.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.530
We have to understand this.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.430
It has many risks, inorganic

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.670
growth, you have to integrate

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.050
into companies with different

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.030
cultures, etc.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:14.310
It is easy to understand.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.150
How do companies grow in digital

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.330
environments?

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.390
The first thing we see is what

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.750
the main metrics are.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:27.590
It is very important.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.190
This is more than that they are few and

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.930
help us understand very well how

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.410
they work and how this type of business

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.010
grows.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.710
We did answer four questions.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.790


00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.110
The first is, how much does each customer

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.050
generate?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.630
There are two basic metrics here.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.670
ARPU is the mean revenue per

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.130
user.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.290
That is, what we generate on

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.470
average a customer in a period of time.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.010
For example, each customer

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.430
generates us $25 a year.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.170
The second metric is the Customer

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.470
Lifetime Value, which is the value

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.950
that will generate that customer

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:00.990
throughout our lifetime.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.670
That will depend on the ARPU and will

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.870
depend on the time that that

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.230
client stays with us, of the

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.850
recurrence, for example.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.950
The second is how much does

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.870
it cost to capture a customer?

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.310
Here we see two metrics that are

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.370
very basic and you'll have heard thousands

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.370
of times.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.890
As is the cost of acquisition,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.090
it can be the CPA, or if we are

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.250
talking, for example, of a sale.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.290
How much does it cost to generate a sale?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.050
And we also have another perspective

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.470
that is similar, which is the cost

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.490
of customer acquisition, which is the

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.110
CAD.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.630
In this case, therefore, it applies more

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.490
if, for example, we are talking about

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.990
a customer of a subscription, etc.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.490
We already know how much customers generate

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.630
for us, we already know how much it costs

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.510
us to capture it.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.070
So we can already calculate how

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.590
much we earn with each of the customers.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.250
That can be, for example, the Customer

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.630
Lifetime Value, everything that

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.910
generates us, minus the cost of

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.150
acquiring a customer.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.350
This is a very basic account

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.430
for all companies with digital

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.650
growth engines.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.250
And the other perspective we like

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.370
to incorporate is, how long

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.070
do we recover the investment?

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.390
That is, we invest in marketing

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.750
to capture a customer, but

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.990
how long will we get it back

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.250
through revenue?

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.790
This is called the CAC Payback.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.910
You have to keep in mind that

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.390
if, for example, you recover in 15

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.750
days the investment you are making

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.990
to capture a customer, you only have

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.310
to finance that growth during those

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.450
15 days, and in 15 days it is already

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.530
generating a positive cash flow.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.090
If, however, what happens is that

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.790
we invest in capturing a

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.730
customer and do not recover that

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.450
cost of acquisition until within,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.330
for example, 12 months, we have

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.130
to finance growth for all

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.930
that time.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.830
So if we want to be very aggressive

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.770
in growth, we will almost

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.210
always have to resort

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.450
to foreign funding or to

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.550
capitalize strongly.
