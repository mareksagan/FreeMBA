00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.310
From now on, when you think about

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.810
a sector, one of the analysis variables

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.210
you should incorporate is

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.450
concentration.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.150
Concentration depends on the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.570
number of competitors there are,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.610
how large those competitors

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.350
are and how the cake is distributed,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.890
how the market share or market

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.170
share is distributed.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.430
And according to that, we have

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.550
very concentrated sectors, in which

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.310
a few competitors are very large

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.990
and a large part of the cake is distributed,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.350
or sectors that are at the other

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.590
end, which are very little concentrated

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.370
sectors, what we call atomized

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.430
sectors, in which there

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
are many, very small and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.730
none has a very preponderant

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.730
weight over the total.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.630
As we see, this is not white

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.110
or black, but it is a scale.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.370
At the extreme of concentration, the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.110
greatest concentration, is a monopoly.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.270
There is only one company.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.490
There is no competition.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.930
More concentration, less

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.030
competition.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.490
Monopoly, in the case of Microsoft,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.050
in its operating system for computers,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.750
Monopoly has huge advantages

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.070
for the company, which is the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.410
monopolistic, and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.790
is that it has almost freedom

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.490
to fix prices, does not have

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.570
to worry about others,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.430
etc.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.010
It is common sense, it is easy to understand.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.090
This is the ideal situation.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.150
There are some things that are oligopoly.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.830
Without becoming a monopoly, there

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.690
are many sectors in which there

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.810
are a few players that share

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.590
almost the entire market.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.090
The concentration is very concentrated.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.330
Use this type of reasoning.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.650
Very concentrated sectors,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.590
such as search engines, where

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.950
Google, Bing and Yahoo share

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.630
almost the entire market.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.850
Or the cola drinks, in which we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.230
have Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.590
Or the operating systems for smartphones,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.990
with iOS and Android, which

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.990
almost have the whole too.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.810
Without being a monopoly, we have

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.070
seen cases that are oligopolies.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.110
There is a lot of concentration.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.390
These companies, which are

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.770
so big, so powerful, are very benefited

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.690
from these circumstances.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.830
There is little competition.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.310
They can even make tacit non-aggression

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010
pacts.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.430
They are the ones who lead the change

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.030
in the industry, the ones who fix

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.850
prices, etc.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.150
And at the other extreme, there are the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.750
cases of greater atomization.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.510
Or even less concentration.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.050
They are industries in which there

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.690
are many competitors, very many,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.470
and there is none that has a very

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.350
high market share.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.850
A very atomized market, for

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.110
example, is the restaurant

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.310
sector in your city.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.030
How many restaurants are there

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.250
in your city or country?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.990
by Miles.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.250
Does anyone have a 20% market

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.450
share?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.930
No to.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.730
There will be chains like the American,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.050
like McDonald's, for example, that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.690
have many restaurants.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.070
But still, the weight on the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.870
total is very small.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.070
As we can see, there are no leaders.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.670
There are companies that are bigger

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.850
than others, but there is none that

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.970
can impose their law.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.050
They all compete.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.950
In this case, they compete in

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.830
a different way.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.890
Each has its space.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.230
Let's think of American business

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.210
schools.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.090
American business

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.830
schools, which are very

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.410
many, hundreds, all

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.530
share the whole cake.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.910
But there is none that has a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.170
30% of the students or sales.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.730
It is an atomized market.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.290
Let me give you another example, the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.430
fashion industry.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.290
If you wonder if the fashion industry

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.250
is more concentrated or more

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.270
atomized, you probably come to

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.510
mind the big groups like Inditex

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.650
or H&M or Primark.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.250
And you think it's concentrated,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.990
because of course, those groups have

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.970
a huge volume.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.910
And it is true that they have a

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.350
lot of volume, but in relation to the total

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.710
market, they are residual.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.930
I give you the data.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.470
These three things I've told you

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.950
do not exceed 5% of the total market share.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.870
But if you think it right, you think how

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.830
many stores and how many e-commerce

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.650
there are in the world millions

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.150
and millions and millions.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.430
And above all that total market,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.870
or think of your own city, or

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.610
especially that market, how much

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.610
do each of the large groups weigh?

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.890
It is very little.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.330
It is very little.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.670
We can say that this is

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.410
an atomized sector.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.330
Another sector is atomized,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.130
for example, because the sector is like

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.290
the provision of legal services or

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.250
lawyers, in which there are thousands

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.530
of lawyers' offices.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.850
It's true that some are very

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.010
big, like Baker & McKenzie,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.450
which is the second worldwide.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.390
However, Baker & McKenzie, no matter

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.350
how second it is worldwide,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.270
and no matter how many thousands

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.930
of employees, over the total volume

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.030
of legal services business worldwide,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.650
because it is, let's say,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.050
a drop in the ocean.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.530
To conclude, let's see that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.890
really the concentration and atomization

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.330
of a sector is variable

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.250
over time.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.250
In many sectors, there

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.510
is a tendency to

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.850
concentration.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.790
Let us see some example.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.430
Food stores, the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.490
food industry.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.110
It was very, very, very atomized.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.670
They were small shops in the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.930
urban centers.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.230
Small distributors

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.090
The distribution grew.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.510
And not only was the large distribution

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.310
in supermarkets growing,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.110
but also the larger groups

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.130
of supermarkets

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.770
were acquiring, merging

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.370
with the smaller ones.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.850
The industry is increasingly

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.630
concentrating every day.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.130
Think, from a sector that is made

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.370
up of thousands of small food stores,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.730
to a few years later local supermarkets,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.250
to the current trend that

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.610
are large groups that have been

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.630
acquiring all the local supermarkets,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.670
because the sector

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.990
every day there are fewer

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.610
players and every day

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.210
is more concentrated.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.650
It has happened...

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.130
The trend to concentration we have

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.230
seen in the automotive sector,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.130
for example.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.850
This is the Volkswagen group, which

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.290
has been acquiring brands, brands,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.890
manufacturers, since a Spanish

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.970
manufacturer, such as SEAT, for example.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.490
As we can see, there are fewer

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.530
and fewer groups with more brands.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.050
We see that the sector

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.050
has been concentrated.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.210
What is the reason for this?

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.790
Economies of scale.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.830
Large companies benefit

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.050
from economies of scale, which

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.950
is something we will

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.830
study later, which allows

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.770
them to save costs.
