WEBVTT

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.780
We will be taking the answers

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.420
to the growth strategy test.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.510
The matrix of Igor Ansov helps us to

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.990
what?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.070
To understand and visualize

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.290
the alternatives of growth that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.150
a company has or to choose the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.910
most profitable growth strategy.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.710
The correct answer is

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.950
A.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.050
It helps us visually understand

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.950
what the strategic

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.390
alternatives are.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.930
Ansov determines that there are two

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.470
dimensions or two axes.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.690
And the one we have in yellow, what axis

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.150
is it?

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.590
It is the axis in which we determine

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.650
whether we will go to current

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.970
markets or new markets.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.330
Instead, the horizontal axis, the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.090
axis of the X, forces us

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.110
to determine whether we will go

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.030
to new products or we will

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.470
grow with current products.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.010
If a company is expanding

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.950
internationally, we are

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.850
talking about a market development

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.170
strategy.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.430
Which growth strategy

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.830
carries the most risks?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.930
Clearly it is diversification.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.550
Why is?

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.130
You are heading to new markets

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.410
or new products.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.050
Therefore, the unknowledge, risk

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.950
and certainty is greater or is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.710
maximum.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
Nike launches new shoes,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.470
sponsored by a NBA strategy.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.970


00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.930
What are we talking about?

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.370
Market development, product

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.150
development and market

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.470
development.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.110
Sure a lot of people have

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.230
responded to product development,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.370
but it's not, because really

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.490
what Nike is doing in this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.450
case is growing within its

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.370
current market.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.370
The only thing that has followed

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.770
is a marketing strategy because

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.510
it has sponsored a NBA figure.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.530
And the fact that she comes

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.710
out with new shoes is no

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.030
product development for Nike,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.670
it is simply a new model.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.350
So what you are doing is growing

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.830
in your current market, penetrating

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.370
the market.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.610
Coca-Cola invests $20 million

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.670
to gain market share

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.490
in Mexico

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.310
It is clear that this is a case similar

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.430
to the previous one.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.790
What you are really doing is investing

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.670
in marketing to grow in a market

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.990
where you are already present,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.390
penetration into the market.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.910
In the growth phase of a sector,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.190
what is the most appropriate

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.230
growth strategy?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.870
The right answer is market

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.610
penetration as well, because

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.110
if the sector is growing,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.650
you can continue to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.490
grow as you invest.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.870
Therefore, it makes no sense

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.150
at this time to be thinking

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.630
about growth strategies like

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.830
product development or market

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.810
development.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.370
You can still grow a lot within your

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.150
current market.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.210
But here I propose something more.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.330
What if we had to choose a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.050
second growth strategy?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.250
In this case, we are in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.410
the growth phase.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.390
We have said that the most logical

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.790
and sensible thing is market penetration.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.050


00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.290
But if we had to opt for a second

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.930
one, it seems that market

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.730
development can go in the direction.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.390
This market is growing and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.170
we can do so internationally.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.910
It makes more sense to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.050
grow internationally than

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.710
to develop new products.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.270
McDonald's is in a disarray.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.510
We are talking about product development.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.910
They are now targeting their existing

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.090
customers with a new product.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.790
However, McDonald's has also followed

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.310
diversification strategies.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.530
Because the MccafÃ©, entering

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.410
the coffee shop business, is

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.770
a clear diversification

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.470
strategy because it targets

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.790
new customer segments.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.970
We are no longer talking about

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.970
the customers of the hamburgers

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.650
or fast food.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.290
It also comes with new products

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.350
such as coffee.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.250
It is diversification.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.990
The natural option for growth is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.290
the presentation of the market.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.450
When is it important to start

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.470
with strategies that are more

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.010
risky?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.010
That is, for the rest.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.350
Let us see.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.970
The industry is in the maturity

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.710
phase.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.610
and correct.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.410
When it is already very difficult to grow,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.070
it makes sense to start looking for

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.830
other alternatives.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.350
You can benefit from synergies.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.870
If there are synergies, you benefit

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.970
from them and say it is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.750
an incentive to grow with

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.970
other markets, products,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.730
etc.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.690
When your market has stopped growing.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.870
I think the three answers

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.450
are good.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.230
Anorganic growth always involves

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.830
an agreement with another company.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.050
Anorganic growth, whether a merger,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.610
an acquisition, a gen venture,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.510
a strategic alliance,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.250
there is always a second

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.830
company.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.370
And among the following, which

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.570
formulas do not correspond

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.770
to an inorganic growth strategy?

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.090
Gen venture, merger, M&A, which are mergers

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.390
or acquisitions, or the strengthening

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.510
of the distribution channel.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.310
This is the.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.610
Facebook has grown dramatically

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.170
around the world and in a

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.650
few years, thanks mainly

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.950
to the network effects

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.990
generated.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.310
Facebook had a competitive

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.250
advantage and grew dramatically.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.970
And this how did he do it?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.470
What is due?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.990
What is organic or inorganic growth?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.030
We are talking about

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.510
organic growth.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.430
It grew with its internal resources

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.670
leveraging on that strong competitive

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.770
advantage.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.150
Facebook also bought Instagram

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.550
for $1 billion.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.970
In this case, we are talking about

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.930
inorganic growth, an acquisition.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.610
What are the benefits of

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.730
inorganic growth?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.890
Does it allow you to grow faster?

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.010
and correct.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.130
It grows much faster than it

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.050
does through your internal

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.090
resources.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.530
Do you benefit from the know-

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.390
how of other companies?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.790
and yes.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.310
You buy, merge, or make an alliance

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.590
with another company and benefit

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.090
from that company's know-how.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.450
Knowledge and a lot of things.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.710
There are many things that this company has to do with,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.630
and there are many synergies.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.290
What is the most important in the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.890
management of the company?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.170
No to.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.350
This is the opposite.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.970
It's much easier when you

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.490
grow from your internal resources.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.170
When you are incorporating

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.830
other companies, management

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.090
becomes very complicated.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.230
It complicates culture,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.870
complicates operations, complicates

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.190
placement, etc.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.190
H&M reaches an agreement with a local

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.630
partner in Singapore.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.810
And what they do is open two

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.930
stores, but what they do is create

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.110
a company in which H&M holds

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.170
a 40% stake and the remaining 60%

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.210
with a local partner.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.830
This what is?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.670
It is a joint venture.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.120
Organic growth helps you focus

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.900
and strengthen your current competitive

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.940
advantage.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.640
When you grow internally, from your

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.860
internal resources, well, because

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.860
it allows you to have more focus.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.140
However, inorganic growth

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.520
can allow you to rely on the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.840
competitive advantage of another

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.580
company.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.360
Both statements are correct.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.040
Kellogg's to buy Pringles.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.960
What do you think was the main synergy?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.940
What Pringles benefits from

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.740
Kellogg's brand?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.780
No, because Pringles is still

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.140
sold under the Pringles brand.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.660
What benefits Pringles from

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.100
Kellogg's distribution channel?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.140
Yes is.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.400
And Amazon combines the organic

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.920
and inorganic growth strategy.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.820
and correct.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.940
A technology manufacturer who

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.420
previously sold through the indirect

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.520
distribution channel, i.e. through

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.480
distributors, decides to create

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.680
its own stores and compete

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.700
with its own distributors.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.140
This could be Apple, for example.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.540
What are we talking about?

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.700
Is it vertical forward,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.360
backward or horizontal?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.720
Clearly it's a vertical integration

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.000
forward because you've entered

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.140
your distributor's business.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.320
Amazon is entering the book publishing

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.200
business.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.460
This is the opposite

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.660
of vertical integration.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.000


00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.540
Netflix produces its own content

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.560
and audiovisual.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.140
It is the same, it is vertical

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.300
integration backwards.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.420
You have entered the business of your suppliers.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.160
What are the immediate benefits

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.380
of vertical integration?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.280
We have to select the wrong option.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.820
Capture margins throughout

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.880
the supply chain, yes.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.040
Yes, because when you enter the business

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.840
of your distributors, your customers,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.900
or your suppliers, you are capturing

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.720
margins from other links

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560
in the chain.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.800
That is, it is a benefit.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.860
Building barriers to entry.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.300
Let's think of Netflix, for

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.000
example, Amazon has

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.640
developed strong entry barriers

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.540
thanks to vertical integration,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.900
thanks to being present in more

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.760
links of the chain.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.160
Gain market share in your current

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.060
market.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.820
This is not an immediate benefit

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.800
from vertical integration,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.540
because when you enter the business

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.300
of your distributors

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.220
or your suppliers, you

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.120
are not strengthening your position

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.540
in the current market, or at

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.140
least it is not an immediate benefit.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.220
So this is the wrong answer.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.920
What is the supply chain

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.060
of Coca-Cola?

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.220
Coca-Cola is here, it is a manufacturer.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.360
And large stores like Harrods,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.440
for example, because it is a retailer,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.660
it is a distributor.
