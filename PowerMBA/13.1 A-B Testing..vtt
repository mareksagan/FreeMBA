WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.820
And we start with, we're in

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.300
the Fallen at the top and

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.380
our goal is to attract traffic.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.640
We do this through

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.820
Facebook Ads.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.800
We have advertisements like

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.560
this.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.300
What can we prove?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, because in Facebook

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.060
Ads we can test the images,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.660
we can test the texts, etc.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.020
And we will do so if we have an

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.720
ad like this, what we will do is,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.160
imagine, we will think, because

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.940
we put a totally different

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.320
photo, that it be with real

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.640
people and we try it.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700
Then we make two identical ads,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.880
in which in one we put the photo

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.220
we have seen, which is like a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.440
creativity and in the other the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.700
photo of a real person.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.520
And we measure, deriv traffic and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.700
measure for a few days.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.520
What will we measure in this case?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.680
You can calculate the cost per click.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.260
By the way, Facebook and the rest of

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.940
the platforms make it easy to make

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.320
B-head, it's very easy on

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.460
platforms of this type.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.220
Then we measure it and it turns

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.220
out that the image we had put, which

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.760
is that of a creativity,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.300
because it works better, the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.780
cost is lower than when we

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.940
put real images of real people.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.920
Well, well, well, because we have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
already drawn a conclusion.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.180
And now we say, well, we'll use

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.860
that image or that type of images

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.500
and we'll try out with different

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.720
types of text.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.540
We will try with longer

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.040
or shorter texts, etc.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.400
And we do another experiment, we deriv

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.900
traffic for a few days and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.500
we measure the cost per click.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.840
And it turns out that we have

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.480
come to the conclusion that ads with

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.000
a little more text, more

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.620
explanatory, imagine your value

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.660
proposal, case B, because

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.520
they have a lower cost per click.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.800
Well, that's what you've learned.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.140
Or we'll think, for example, that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.120
we're making ads in SEM, using

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.160
Google Adwords and we're the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.840
top one.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.920
We have a text in which we say

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.540
zero commissions, zero concerns.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.860
We are now at a click-

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.980
through ratio of 0.1%.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.740
That is, 0.1% of people who

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.260
see us click on the ad.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.140
But one day we say, because it is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.680
that equal is better, equal is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280
not well understood this of 0, equal

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.300
is better to put 5 commissions or concerns.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.160
Well, but we don't know if it will

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.580
work better or worse.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.220
What we do is, we do a test to B and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.880
it turns out that increases, the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.040
click-through ratio increases to 0.15%.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
So what we do is change

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.870
the ad.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.570
Or let's think we're doing

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.830
email marketing.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.310
We are sending emails to a database,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.350
for example, of 100,000 people.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.870
So how can we optimize

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.810
the strategy?

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.090
In a post, we will think

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.350
about what we can do.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.310
For example, we can touch the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.330
subject, which is the owner of

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.330
the email and the time of the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.970
day we send it.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.930
We're going to do two different scenarios

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.350
where we try different things.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.650
For example, save 80%, in one

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.990
of the cases if we send it at

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.690
8 a.m. or in the scenario

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.690
B because we try super-

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.990
offering and send it at

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.750
9 a.m.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.030
In this case, what will we measure?

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.950
We can measure the percentage of people

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.430
who receive the email and open

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.010
it, which is the open rate.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.600
Well, because it turns out that in

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.460
the scenario A is 5%, it is better.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.580
Well, so is great.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.640
From here on, every time we

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.800
send emails, we will do so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.140
using those parameters.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.660
By the way, in this case also

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.260
the tools we use to make emailings,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.400
MailChimp is the most known,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.540
all incorporate this type

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.780
of functionality.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.700
All of them allow you to do easy test to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.960
bake.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.060
Well, we've already validated what

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.820
is the best time of the day or which

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.520
is the subject that works best, etc.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.900
And now what we want is to test

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.420
different types of content

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.620
within the email and we can, from

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.160
the texts to the images we put,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.200
to for example the call to action

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.500
buttons inside the email,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.840
because there is always a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.900
button inside.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.960
So we try two.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.020
We try one where we put the button

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.880
on one side and another on the other,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.800
and bigger and smaller.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.940
And well, and in this case what we

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.680
have to measure of all the people who

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.960
have opened the email, what percentage

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.420
click on the button.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.780
In case A, the rate is 8% and in case B, 6%.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.850
In addition to using A-B testing, when

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.650
we are in the strategies of customer

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.090
capture, traffic attraction,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.210
forgiveness, A-B testing is used

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.790
daily to optimize everything on

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.430
the web page or on the landing page,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.050
because in addition it is that,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.470
as you already know, we can

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.470
touch thousands of things

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.490
within the web page.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.170
I will give you some examples.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.330
Well, in this case what they did

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.670
is compare two different headlines,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.950
two headlines, and in the second

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.410
case what they did is put more

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.190
explicitly that it was a 30-day

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.580
test, which seems in principle

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.840
as more cutre a headline like

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.000
that, but well, it turns

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.900
out that conversions increased

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.940
a lot.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.480
Or in this case what they did is,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.540
they also checked out

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.400
that they increased sales by 89%,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.760
simply explaining a little more

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.040
the proposal, putting the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.220
word supplement.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.120
Find out what details and what impact they have.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.100
Or this is the case of Electronic

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.420
Arts and the game is SimCity in this

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.240
case, they didn't know if to incorporate

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.520
a huge banner, as you are seeing

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.260
in the block on the left, in which

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.640
they make an offer with a 20%.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.040
And it turns out that when they took

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.240
it off, did an A-B test and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240
took it off, purchases

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.580
increased by 43%.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.220
It is also very common to play

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.080
with forms or call to actions,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.700
because in this case we

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.660
compare between putting a button

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.900
on which you click the button

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.340
and if you open a form later

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.960
or put the form directly on

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.820
the web page.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.360
You can also play with

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.940
the form fields.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.600
As I always say, it's very

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.340
difficult to know intuitively

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.580
which one will work best,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.020
so you have to use A-B testing.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.600
Or you can play with the pop-

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.240
ups and the tools that allow you

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.140
to integrate a pop-up on your website

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.600
allow you to make A-B testing

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.300
very easy.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.740
How do you explain it?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.380
What text do you put in the pop-up?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.180
One or the other.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.580
Or the color of the call to action, which

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.680
is the typical case.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.140
If we put the color in orange,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.020
we convert it 35% more than

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.580
if we put it in green.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.740
Well, I'm inventing the data,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.660
but there are many cases of this

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.240
style.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.500
Another issue that we have is

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.040
very important.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.940
We must try to optimize the

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.400
prices we put, not just the

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.040
prices but how we explain them.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.080
And in this case it is a comparative

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.480
between a system that is modular

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.980
from prices to putting the typical

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.080
price plans.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.020
Well, it turned out that conversions

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.360
increased a lot from the

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.060
most traditional way now,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.580
which is with three plans, because

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.060
it is easier to choose.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.600
And here what we should measure is

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.880
not only conversion, but the average

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.800
ticket as well.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.000
We could do A-B testing

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.180
by putting different prices

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.740
or using pricing strategies.
