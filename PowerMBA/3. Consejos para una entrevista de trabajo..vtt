00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
One of the key stages is the interview, and the interview is an art.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
I think that in the interview, we all have lived the interviews from the position of being interviewed and interviewing.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
There are many tips that are given about the interviews, which are the usual tips, which are almost common sense.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
But I want us to review a series of tips that we can apply and analyze a little why it is important to take it into account.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
The first tip I would give to anyone is that the interview must be prepared.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
Why? Because depending on what you are looking for, to be efficient in the process and know that the candidate has what you are looking for,

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
you have to put practical cases, examples, and all that, or you have it structured and previously planned,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
or you are going to do an interview with a candidate and another, with which you will not be able to compare.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
It will be bullshit, because it will have nothing to do with an interview that you have not prepared, with another, which will be random.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm going to tell you what happens in reality, because you do that well, and what happens in the real world of companies

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
is that suddenly a candidate comes, because there is a process and you have to interview him.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And then you have not prepared anything, I feel bad, and you do the interview.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And it turns out that you want to know if that person is, as we say, a series of values.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
There are topics that you know very well about feeling, about culture, if you understand that person well, but there are others that are more difficult.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
For example, I always say that of micro entrepreneurs.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
And it turns out that I sit with another person, we sit down, we have not prepared anything,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
we ask him some questions, as you say, to the next, or to the next we ask him other questions,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
we already have a mess, we do not do it, not preparing it is a waste of time, because you lose that interview.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It is an inefficiency, total inefficiency.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And sometimes, if there are cases to prepare, it takes a long time to prepare.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
If there are cases that you have to put, because it is the only way to assess if that person, for example, is an entrepreneur,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
or has speed or whatever, and the case takes you a while to prepare it.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
The time you invest in preparing the interview is time you are going to earn to do the interviews,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
because you are going to make them much more agile and much more efficient.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So, first tip, you have to prepare the interview.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Perfect.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
That would be the first tip.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
The second, ask the candidate for examples of everything.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Because you say, I, maybe, for my company values, I am looking for a proactive and innovative person.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
I would ask the candidate, do you consider yourself a proactive person?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And he would say, yes, of course.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So, it is very important that at that moment we say,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I put an example of your day to day where you have shown that proactivity.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
That is, that the candidate exemplifies all kinds of behaviors that you are looking for.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Because the curriculum is very easy, the engineer who is an engineer and has studied at a university has the title.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
But the attitudinal issues are more difficult to contrast and in the end it is what will differentiate a good candidate from another.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
So, second tip, ask the candidate to give you examples of absolutely everything.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
There are times, you also have to help the candidates, because there are times when it is difficult for them, because it is not easy.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
There is a typical question that is always asked, which are your areas of improvement?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And everyone tells you, I am very perfectionist.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
So, in the end you say...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It is that it is always like that, indeed.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Indeed. So, we have to break with that.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Your main weakness, I am very perfectionist.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Because you do it pretending, it is a weakness, but deep down it is what you want.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Indeed. So, in the end, unless you put the candidate in a situation, that is, you do a role play with them.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
You hear that every day, right? In a 95%?

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
In 100% of the interviews, it does not fail. In fact, it is a question that I no longer do.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
But you have to put the candidate in a situation, you have to do role plays with them.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
That is why preparation is so important, because depending on what you are looking for, you have to apply a mini role play in the interview.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
If I am looking for a commercial with business skills, I am going to be a client for two minutes to see the business skills.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Regardless of the business courses that I have given or the business school to which I have gone.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Role play or case, right? It could be...

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, a business case, a role play.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
A test.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
A situation, that is, put the candidate in a situation.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yes, that's it.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
That would be the third tip. Put him in a situation to get those behaviors, those attitudes that you are looking for.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
And basically, along with preparing the interview, those would be my three main tips.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
Prepare the interview, ask the candidate for examples of absolutely everything, put him in a situation or role plays.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
And then another thing that may seem like a big deal is to look for that sparkle in the candidate's eyes.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Confirm that motivation.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I always ask a question that may seem very basic and that people can prepare, but in the end I always tell them,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
what is it that differentiates you from the rest of the candidates I am going to interview?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
A motivated person is going to tell you a list of brutal things.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
A person who is over-the-top or who is not so motivated, maybe none of them come to mind.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Like, well, I'm the best.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, but what?

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
So contrast that motivation, not only go beyond the sparkle in the eyes, which is true,

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
but also give you reasons why they make you different.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
When he shines in the eyes, he will give you the reasons because they will come out naturally.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
I always say this, also in companies, for example in startups, where everything has given us a vision

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
and employees have to share that vision.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Our vision is, we are revolutionizing the world of business training.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And then the one who gets in the car has, as you said, they have to shine in the eyes when we tell them this.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Because if not, it is impossible.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
This is like in a relationship.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
In a relationship, if at 15 days you are getting tired of the other person or you no longer have enthusiasm,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
well, how are we going to... it is impossible.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
If at 15 days everything has to be beautiful, there is no longer enthusiasm, how are we going to get to year 5?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
It is impossible.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Therefore, you tell him the project, you tell him your vision and as you said, his eyes have to shine.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
And confirm that that shine is the motivation you are looking for.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Exactly.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Thank you.
