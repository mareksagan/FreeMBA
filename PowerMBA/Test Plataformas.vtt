WEBVTT

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.620
We are going to get the answers from

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.840
the Platform Strategy Test.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.260
In what business models does

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.720
the company create direct value

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.740
to its customers in linear models?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.240
And in which business models is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.920
the company not the owner of the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.960
media or the productive

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.700
factors on the platforms?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.300
Wake up what we said.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.060
Uber is not the owner of the vehicles.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.680
Airbnb is not the owner of the

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.860
houses, for example.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.540
Thus, platforms are not

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.260
owners of the means or

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.760
productive factors.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.600
On platforms, what is done is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.860
to create an infrastructure

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.620
within which users generate

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.340
value for each other.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.600
What is Netflix?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.740
Netflix is a linear

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.920
model.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.400
Netflix does what it does is license

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.240
or create audiovisual content that it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.840
sells in subscription format to its

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.860
customers.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.280
If you were buying directly

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.660
at Netflix, for example,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.720
to the creators of content,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.480
which were various companies,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.600
we could talk about a platform,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.740
but not.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.860
It is a linear model.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020
Do you choose the features

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.040
of a platform?

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.880
Are there two sides or segments?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.900
Is the value generated in a linear way?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.320
No to.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.520
The company is not the owner

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.560
of the productive means and the main

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.720
key resource it needs is the platform

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.300
itself, it is technology.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.940
Why does the winner

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.980
take it all?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.880
Because network effects help to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.540
gain traction or momentum to one

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.240
or very few platforms to the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.440
leaders, right.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.080
Because they generate very important

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.580
entry barriers for the rest

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.260
because of those network

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.680
effects, right.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.740
And because larger platforms

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.160
benefit from larger

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.660
network effects and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.460
become almost monopolies.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.160
The winner takes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.800
it all.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.620
What is the network effect?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.060
Is the value increase generated

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.160
as the number of users

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.360
and interactions of

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.680
those users increases?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.260
and yes.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.220
Or is it the increase in

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.260
profitability that occurs from

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.960
having more users?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.140
No, that is another topic.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.440
The network effect is to increase

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.800
value for everyone on

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800
the platform.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.380
What is the network effect?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080
A vicious circle for the most

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.440
virtuous platforms or for the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.420
bigger ones, yes.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.020
Because they benefit from more value,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.060
more users, more value.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.080
A vicious circle for the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.020
rest of them.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.220
Both are correct.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.140
Platforms are more valuable companies

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.360
than their linear competitors,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.340
because they benefit from

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.880
greater entry barriers once they

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.660
have reached that critical mass,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.940
those network economies, that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720
network effect, correct.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.940
Lineable models are more scalable

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.820
than platforms, because the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.760
resources needed are more scalable,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.600
this is false.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.400
The most scalable resource is technology,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100
it is the platform itself.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.100
You can grow a lot without increasing

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.600
your costs.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.620
This answer is false.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.800
Which is more scalable?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.980
Technology, people, real

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.180
estate or machinery?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.940
Because usually the most scalable

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.180
resource is technology, because once

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.740
you have it developed,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.080
you can capture more and more customers

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.020
without incurring additional

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.760
variable costs.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.300
A real estate portal is a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.100
platform with a model

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.200
marketplace ranked where more

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.820
in social media is one ranked.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.140
Now let us understand the difference.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.700
What is the difference between

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.380
a marketplace model like Airbnb,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.800
for example, and a ranked one?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.300
In the marketplace, transactions

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.780
are generated within the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.460
platform.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.120
In the marketplace, transactions

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.300
are generated outside the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.840
platform.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.800
Where are Airbnb transactions being made?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.180
They are generated inside.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.640
However, in a classified

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.400
model you are connecting supply

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.280
and demand.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.480
What happens is that supply and demand,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960
then the transaction, are generated

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.100
outside the platform.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.100
In the marketplace, transactions

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.520
are generated inside.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.380
Which of the two models of monetization

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.840
is more attractive to you than the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.480
two we are seeing?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.380
The marketplace or the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.620
classified platform.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.260
Well, because it is more attractive

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.280
that of the marketplace because

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.760
within your platform are generating

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.480
payments, transactions, and you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.040
find it easier to charge a percentage

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.180
of it.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.740
Airbnb, what is a marketplace,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.100
ranked or social network?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.220
It is a marketplace.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.440
If on Airbnb all you do is connect

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.820
supply and demand, but

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.980
then supply and demand are fixed

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.900
or rents are produced

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.180
outside of Airbnb, they'll

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.840
be ranked, but it's that

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.600
on Airbnb you pay directly.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.600
The classified typically have

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.640
a monetization model that is

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.440
similar to that of a newspaper.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.360
That is, they have advertising

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.780
revenue, advertising revenue.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.540
Yes, this is correct.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.780
Take into account what we have said.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.060
Transactions are being

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.260
generated out, so what they

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.040
do is monetize normally.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.240
Well, it is one of the possibilities

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.780
of monetization options.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.360
Money through advertisers.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.040
LinkedIn is a social network whose

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.420
monetization formula is as follows.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.100
Advertising income, that is, companies

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.060
that advertise, that advertise

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.980
on LinkedIn, or advertising

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.360
income plus premium services.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.580
It is clearly the second.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.140
LinkedIn offers many types of

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.040
premium services to to individuals,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.100
people looking for work,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.880
etc.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.300
On demand platforms, such as

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.240
Cavify, for example, or Uber,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.320
price fixation is freely

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.140
carried out by supply and demand

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.600
or is set by the platform

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.400
itself.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.900
In marketplaces, the price is usually

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.100
determined by the supply.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.300
However, on demand platforms

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.340
are a more key-in-hand, closer

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.940
service in which the price

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.260
is directly fixed by the platform

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.980
itself.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.500
In on-demand platforms, the main

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.800
determining factor of value

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800
what is it?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.600
The variety of offer, that is, that

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.760
there is a lot of very atomized

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.400
and quality offer, for example,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.580
on Airbnb, in a marketplace,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.680
the more offer, not only the more

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.260
quantity of offer, but

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.680
the more offerers there is

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.620
is much better.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.440
Or on demand platforms is availability,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.440
that is, it does not depend so much

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.760
on how many people there are, because

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.880
you do not have the perception

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.360
of how much offer there is, but the

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.240
only thing that matters is that they

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.600
provide you the service in time

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.320
and form.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.120
On demand platforms is like

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.940
that.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.750
On platforms like TripAdvisor

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.010
or YouTube, value is generated

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.130
by interaction with other users

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.090
or value is generated by

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.590
interaction with the content

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.670
that those users have generated.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.290
In these networks that are

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.610
more content-centered, value

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.570
is generated by content itself,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.470
not by interaction

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.870
with other users.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.330
Facebook, for example, would be a

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.330
mixed model.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.490
Facebook is more direct with

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.810
other people, but in the case

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.330
of TripAdvisor or YouTube

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.030
it is clear that you

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.310
interact with the content.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.070
In linear models, do you have a

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.850
higher need for initial investment?

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.070
No to.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.310
Do you bring value to your first customers?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.810
and yes.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.850
Is it difficult to bring value

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.690
to the first users?

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.050
No to.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.630
We have to overcome the so-called challenge

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.410
of the egg and the chicken.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.050
Of these four features, only the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.750
second, the B, is a characteristic

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.810
of linear models, and is

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.490
that you bring value to your

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.530
first customers.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.970
You don't need network effects, you

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.410
don't need critical mass.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.170
How did the red ice cream overcome the challenge

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.110
of the egg and the chicken?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.910
What did José Del Barrio say?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.250
Reaching critical mass in a specific

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.550
geographic niche, they focused

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.750
on specific neighborhoods and

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.310
added both the supply of

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.130
restaurants and demand.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.050
Offering an intrinsic value to

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.330
one side of the platform, like

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.550
OpenTable, for example,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.010
allows you to add users

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.350
within one side, without

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.870
depending on the network effect.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.910
Is this true or not?

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.650
It is true.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.570
It is one of the strategies to overcome

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.390
the challenge of the egg and chicken.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.170
What you do is, add to one side,

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.030
in the case of OpenTable were

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.450
restaurants too.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.150
Why is it?

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.290
Because it offers restaurants

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.190
a service like software, it offers

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.250
them value.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.710
So the restaurants, let's say,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.050
join OpenTable without

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.690
the need for a critical mass

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.710
of consumers, of users.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.970
And once you have reached it, that

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.210
you have added a sufficient mass

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.210
of supply, you open it to users,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.750
you open it to consumers.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.250
So that is the correct answer.
