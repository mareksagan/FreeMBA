WEBVTT

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.740
We are with Juan, who is the CEO

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.380
of the Super, and we will analyze

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.520
the innovation in the business model

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520
that you have generated with

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.440
respect to traditional supermarkets

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.360
and online supermarkets, and subsequently

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.860
we will analyze, I would

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.060
like you to tell us how the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.040
situation in the sector is, how

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.340
models like yours are penetrating,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.260
what percentage

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.600
is on the total market,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000
etc.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.600
The first thing I will explain is,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.620
I will briefly explain the business

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.020
model of a traditional supermarket,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.320
it is a linear model, the supermarket

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.180
has to stock, it has to buy that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.280
commodity, it has hundreds or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.720
thousands of suppliers, much

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.440
smaller than it, and it sells through

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.480
the distribution channel, it is a

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.500
physical channel, there

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.660
are sales points owned by that supermarket

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.720
chain, therefore it is a business

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.460
model that is very intensive,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.940
it is very resource-intensive,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.260
because you have to finance the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.000
purchase of all that stock,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.660
and it is also little scalable,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.920
because the distribution channel

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.620
is little scalable, because they

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.840
are sales points, in addition

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.160
to many square meters, and the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.960
online supermarkets arrive,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.920
which in some cases are

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.060
the own web pages of traditional

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.340
supermarkets, and in other

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.380
cases are supermarkets

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.740
that are born purely

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.480
online.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.760
What are the advantages of the online

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.680
supermarket business model over

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.420
the traditional?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.960
The scalability of the distribution

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.520
channel can grow much faster,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580
because a physical supermarket,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.960
if you want to grow in Murcia,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.320
has to look for locals, condition

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.720
them, etc., a digital supermarket

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.140
is much more scalable, because

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.440
its channel is more scalable,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.940
but it comes from the super, and

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.720
it is a turn of thunder more

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.020
yet, and it is to turn a model

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.260
online supermarket linear

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.940
into a marketplace that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.180
connects the supermarkets

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.120
with buyers.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.840
So, I would like you to explain,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.340
to begin with, what is the value

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.060
proposal of the super?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.580
Let’s start with the value proposal

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.620
for the consumer, and what would

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.200
be the advantages you offer with

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.560
respect to the online supermarket?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.600
Perfect, basically, the food market

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.040
in Spain are 66.000.000.000

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.560
euros, the digital share has

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.900
never exceeded 1%, in 2015

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.380
0.9 according to Magrama,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.680
then, why in a market so important

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.700
as that of food the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.900
digital share is so

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.240
low?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.420
When in other sectors like fashion

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.800
we are talking about 15%,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.260
always talking about Spain,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.700
even if you go to the UK the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.820
food quota is 6%, in France 4.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.560
4%, but in Spain had never

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380
come to take off.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.100
Why does a market not get

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.500
off in digital when what is offered

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.820
is convenient?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.260
Convenience is, to explain it by

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.220
if someone, convenience is convenience,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.960
comfort, that in this case is to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.620
be delivered to you quickly and

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.180
that is convenient for you, right?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460
It is, in the end, the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.260
main reason why people

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.060
buy online, for ease,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.580
for that convenience.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.160
And that’s the main reason people

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.400
buy at the supermarket that’

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.340
s closer to your home too,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.720
for pure convenience.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.820
Totally, and that is why in Spain

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.540
it is a country where the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.420
nearby stores have so much

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.240
flourished and there is a great

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.120
battle between the big brands,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.500
among the market leaders,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.720
to do with proximity.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.380
So if we have such a low penetration

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.280
rate within the digital market

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.720
is basically because supply,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.200
that is, supermarkets

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.220
have never come to offer

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.400
an offer that suits

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.080
the needs of demand.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.760
It is convenient because it takes a long time.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.580
and totally.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.880
What are those needs?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.620
Typically, the type of digital

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.120
user that buys these services is a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.500
city-city customer, urban,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.000
24, 40, 45 years old, middle-medium-

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.160
high purchasing power.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.540
So, we are talking about that if

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.720
they haven’t done so far it was because

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.780
they were not getting that

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.280
offer.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.220
What is that offer?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.480
Basically, when a user decides that

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.360
he wants to fill the refrigerator in the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.340
target we are talking about, it

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.040
is when he opens the refrigerator and

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.240
sees it is empty.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.180
Unless you have a house with several

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.800
children where you are well planned,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.860
that’s not the case.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960
So, when you want to make that purchase

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.280
it results that until now you had

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.620
to get into, as you were saying,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.320
in a few websites that in many

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.500
cases are outdated, in many cases

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.760
they are delivering you a day,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.940
two days later and above in slots

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.900
of four hours, two to four

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.480
hours.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.700
That means you won’t eat today,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.000
if you won’t eat tomorrow

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.420
or last morning, that’s, and

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.320
you have to be just.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.660
So you have to get back from work

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.340
that typically this type of customers

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.800
are bound up for work, for leisure,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.860
in the end it is a type of profile

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.120
that the type of digital profile

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.700
wants to take advantage

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.620
of your time.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.560
He is a smart user and wants to take

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.440
advantage of his time.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.960
So, these users first crossed

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.440
that technological barrier.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.780
Hear, come, I will try to make

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.060
the purchase on a website like

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.860
Mercadona, which he himself

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.580
recognized, my website is a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.920
shit, it has no photos.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.420
How will you go shopping

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.100
if you don’t even have photos?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.500
Indistintly you have to wait one or

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260
two days and on top of that you’

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.440
re waiting two or four hours

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.120
inside your home.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.480
And not just that, but when you

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.160
get the purchase you open the bag and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.280
what do you find yourself with?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.920
Do you find that the milk you have

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.740
breakfast with has not brought you

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.600
or brought you another brand because

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.940
they have replaced under their

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.900
best criteria or that the fresh has

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.000
chosen it in favor of the best for

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.860
the supermarket, not the best of

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.560
the user?

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.300
Then, the user at that time

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.920
says, I had to fight with a

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.720
web, wait one or two days to receive

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.980
my purchase and in third place

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.940
I have to go down to the Chinese,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.560
I have to go down to the nearest

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.680
supermarket because I want my milk

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.320
to be able to eat breakfast

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.800
tomorrow.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.740
What is what happens?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.640
That is why 38% of consumers who

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.780
have ever made a digital purchase

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.140
do not use it because the offer

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.060
is not available.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.300
Has the 38 ever done that?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.660
Of course, between 25 and 40 years.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.180
The service is very low because

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.140
the service is very poor.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.520
That is, then the frequency, not

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.000
only the frequency and recurrence

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.940
of those users is very low

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.980
and that is why we reached

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.380
a 0.9% of a market as potent

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.400
as 66 billion euros in Spain.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500
We have already identified the keys

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.460
for which the market does not grow.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.900
Of course, why not...

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.400
That is, they are big players,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.780
why aren’t they offering this?

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.340
Basically because their logistics

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.940
costs are higher in many

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.520
cases or equal to the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.020
profit they are collecting.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.100
Once again citing, because it was

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.520
Mr. Roch, which is the number

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.300
one chain undisputedly in Spain,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.500
even in digital too,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.020
with that web...

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.000
The website has not improved, it is

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.640
still the same as...

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.780
A new platform is scheduled

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.880
for the first quarter of next year.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.020
Why did you launch this new platform?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.040
Because they are also obeying third-

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.980
party pressures, as she

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.420
is beginning to harm not

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.800
only your online channel but

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.100
also your offline channel,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.720
because the line between offline

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.360
and online is very thin and

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.720
within that paradigm that

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.160
more that famous omnicanality

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.260
is joined, that more offline

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.580
is joined with online, we

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.900
are talking that the same day

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.740
delivery today begins to

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.680
charge a very important

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.620
importance.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.580
Do you offer that?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.200
We offer the same day delivery

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.300
to go clarify the value proposal

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.680
with respect to the online

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.860
supermarket to start the same

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.900
day delivery.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.340
That is.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.300
We have always been positioned

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.540
as partners of the supermarkets.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.700
We are a technology company.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.000
The English court, the English court.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.060
Everyone knows what I

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.560
am doing with technology.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.060
What am I dedicated to?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.520
A marketplace, which is an idea

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.140
that comes from the United States

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.280
through Instacart, a marketplace

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.220
where the user can

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.860
choose the supermarkets

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.160
where he or she wants

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.240
to make the purchase.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.020
We are offering a brand that the

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.900
customer is already recognizing.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.140
You can buy, you can choose

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.880
Mercadona, you can choose DIA, you

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.420
can choose El Corte Inglés,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.800
the first brands within Spain.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.700
You will find the same catalogue

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.100
always within our website and

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.060
we will first deliver you

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.800
all the purchase in an hour.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.000
That is, if they are now, I put

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.820
an example, at 5 p.m. I will be

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.020
able to deliver you from 6

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.640
to 7 p.m.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.000
But I go further.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.980
If you shop at 9 a.m. but you

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.620
know you’re going to arrive

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.780
at 9 a.m., you’ll be able to

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.840
choose between 9 and 10 a.m.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.120
Because that’s the important thing,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.780
that the user not only receives it

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.640
on the same day delivery, but that

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.340
he has a band as short and better

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.220
as possible to receive all his order.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.420
I think the value proposal is

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.480
very clear for now.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.900
I wonder what the price

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.780
is for the user.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.160
In this case, we have agreements

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.680
with supermarket brands.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.520
The business model is that

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.480
supermarkets pay us a

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.460
fee for the purchases

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.560
we are receiving, because

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.100
we capture users and

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.560
we pick and we deliver.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.180
We handle the entire value chain,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.360
capture and logistics

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.560
distribution.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.400
You buy it and take

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.240
it to...

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.860
That is.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.980
And secondly, the user does what

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.800
is paying a shipping fee, which is

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.220
5.95 euros, which is a more

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.500
attractive price, that is, per order.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.500
If it is a multi-super we are at 8.90.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.180
Multisuper I mean that you make

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.380
the purchase, that this is the

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.520
real differentiation of

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.360
our platform.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.660
You can buy a portion of frescoes,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.120
for example, in the English cut,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.540
a portion of the dish in the day

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.540
and another part of cosmetics

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.720
in the marketplace.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.380
The difference is

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.040
very clear with respect

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.640
to online supermarkets.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.900
Can you buy it in different

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.180
supermarkets?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.240
When the online supermarket only offers

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.100
you its own.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.020
Can you buy a white mark?

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.880
You don’t know, but

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.300
you can buy a white mark.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.820
You have given a key point.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.620
I’m sorry to cut you off, because 52%

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.460
of the average basket of a Spanish

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.700
is made up of white marks.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.740
And there are other players, such

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.160
as Amazon, who will never be able

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.440
to offer it.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.480
You can also buy the white brand

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.720
from different supermarkets.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.960
You take it in an hour.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.460
And you take it at the time

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.000
it determines, etc.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.740
I think the value proposition

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.780
is very clear.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.280
We will analyze now, and you have

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.180
also told us what the flow of income

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.180
is, because you have told us that

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.460
the supermarkets pay you for the

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.540
sales you are doing, because you

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.480
are capturing a new customer,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.440
you are generating recurrent

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.240
income to the supermarket,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.160
etc.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.180
There is a very important factor

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.900
to analyze your business model, innovation,

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.800
and is that your model relative

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.600
to the one of an online supermarket,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.140
your model for being a

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.200
marketplace, has huge advantages.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.700
It has huge advantages in terms

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.980
of the resources you need,

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.820
compared to the resources

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.160
a online supermarket needs.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.980
Tell us.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.520
Basically, as I said before, we

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.240
are a technology company, and that’

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.540
s where we have to make all

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.940
our improvements.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.680
It is a platform, but apart from what

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.840
we have been developing over

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.760
these almost three years, it is

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.620
a technology that allows the

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.900
logistics of same day delivery

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.600
in a profitable way.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.700
When supermarkets were not

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.620
being able to deliver online

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.240
shopping in 24 or 48 hours,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.600
in those 2 to 4 hour slots,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.200
in a profitable way.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.740
We are doing it on the same

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.000
day, and we are doing it in a

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.340
profitable way, with profitable

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.660
operations.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.320
That’s what it requires

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.680
is a technology that allows

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.620
scalability, and not just that,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.140
but increases productivity

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.640
and automation of all

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.160
our operations.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.220
That is the important thing.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.500
That is the true core of

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.300
our business.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.180
As I said before, I don’t know

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.100
how to make a book.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.900
For that are the supermarkets

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.220
that are making their catalog

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.520
and know perfectly what the newties

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.940
are, what the pricing they have

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.560
to put in.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.580
We at the end, to all these

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.180
operations, as I said, the

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.020
core is all the technology

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.820
that is automating, scaling

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.660
and making profitable all

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.500
operations, and secondly

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.360
is the operating model.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.000
How are we doing this?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.980
We have no warehouses,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.800
we are not buying any kind

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.120
of stock, we have no shrinkage.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.580
Do you not buy food?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.840
I buy it directly in the supermarket.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.080
Do you buy and sell food?

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.600
You don’t provide the service, you

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.300
do what you buy in the supermarket,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.000
and you connect it with

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.560
the customer.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.320
The picking service and

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.180
delivery service.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.960
I need people, I need a technology

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.620
that organizes those people

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.580
and makes all those operations

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.400
profitable, but it’s actually

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.300
a business of people’

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.880
s profitability.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.660
Once I get the order within

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.000
my platform, the algorithm

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.180
automatically assigns

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.100
who is targeted, which

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.900
picker is targeted.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.020
Pickers is the buyer, we call

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.840
him the super buyer.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.820
So, our super-buyer, if you have

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.000
purchased from Mercadona, within

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.420
our website, within the super.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.980
es, that buyer will receive the

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.080
order assigned in your application,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.300
and has an application

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.200
that will help you increase

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.880
productivity and be fast,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.700
but also in time and in

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.100
shape.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.040
Then he will make the purchase inside

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.200
the supermarket where physical, just

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.100
like the user himself would,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.920
he will send you whatsapps, he

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.360
will be able to call you by phone

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.360
and he will say, Borja, the

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.000
merluza has no good taste, the

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.680
milk with which you eat breakfast

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.480
is not left, but I can change

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.580
it for this other.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.020
So, it’s like a personal shopper

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.660
at the end that’s at your service

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.880
to make your purchase.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.540
Once you have made the purchase,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.120
we have two models, either that

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.560
same person delivers you, or

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.640
we have a split of the

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.000
operations that we give to

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.200
a delivery man, a super

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.300
delivery, as we call it,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.840
who will deliver all

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.940
the purchase you have made.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.280
Why are there two different

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.280
types of geography?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.280
Yes indeed.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.080
That lies in what volume of

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.940
demand we have, one, second,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.700
what geographical areas

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.560
we are covering.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.560
We are now in four major

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.740
cities, Madrid, Barcelona,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.160
Sevilla and Málaga, each

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.540
of which has a completely

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.500
different discretion.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.920
In a Madrid, for example, we have

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.600
a much greater demand increase

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.780
than maybe in Seville or Málaga,

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.960
as it is normal, or in a Barcelona,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.240
at the end what marks you

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.540
are the distances for your

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.220
ability to deliver in an hour

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.080
the purchase and delivery.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.600
What we have are clusters,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.720
we call them virtual

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.300
clusters, where we have

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.060
localized our super-buyers.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.180
Depending on the demand of a zone,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.660
for example, for Madrid or the

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.300
West we have an exclusive cluster

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.540
that shares all the western area,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.520
which is very large in extension,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.580
but less population density

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.100
than in a Madrid centre.
