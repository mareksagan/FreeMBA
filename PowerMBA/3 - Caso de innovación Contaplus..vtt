WEBVTT

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.250
Well, as with everything in this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.290
life, the planets aligned and many

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.850
things happened and apart we

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.350
were in the right moment, prepared

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.770
and the market demanded it.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.510
All these things until they happen,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.990
there really is no success in

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.670
any business.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.410
I’ll tell you a little anecdote

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.870
because it was very interesting.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.980
The Plus Account came from a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.070
dentist who ordered us a program

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.490
and didn’t like it.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.370
He commissioned us a accounting

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330
program for his business as a dentist

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.250
and when we delivered it to him he didn’

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.070
t like it.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.910
And then from that accounting

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.390
core that came from this dentist,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.570
we started working on

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.910
a accounting program.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.110
And at that moment the idea came

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.450
and the idea was how his engineer,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.430
always all mathematically, came

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.990
from an equation in which you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.510
said we sold 500 programs

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.170
to 300 thousand pessetas.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.530
I am talking about those when we

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.090
lived in pesetas we sold 500 programs

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.250
to 300 thousand pesetas.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.610
What happens if we

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.130
change the equation?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.430
We sell 300,000 programs for 500 pesetas.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.330
The final sum is the same, but

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.570
the formula is completely

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.270
different.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.670
That idea came up one night between

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.110
my partner and me and that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.210
was exactly what we did.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.150
What we did is that a product that

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.930
cost at that time 300 thousand pesetas,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.490
we are talking at best of 8 thousand

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
euros today, because we sold

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.250
it to 4950 pesetas.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.170
Instead of selling 500 products,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.970
the idea was to sell 100,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.170
000 products.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.690
That idea arose in our heads as they

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570
arise in entrepreneurs of these

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.830
ideas that invade you and your life

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370
disappears, just see that.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.570
And then at the moment that idea

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.010
came up, there was nothing else

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.030
in our lives.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.710
There was no family, there was nothing.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.210
We are working to transform

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.330
this equation.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030
The first thing we said was how

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.150
can we sell 300,000 products of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.230
a thing that is not massive?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670
Where do people

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.690
go every day?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.410
What is the usual sales channel?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.850
The newspaper kiosks.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570
We said, the newspapers

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.030
are our point of sale.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.530
Never in his life had

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.510
sold the newspapers kiosks.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.430
What can we sell in the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.050
newspaper kiosks?

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.270
At what price can we sell it?

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.390
We went to a newspaper kiosk,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.590
we went to several newspaper

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.810
kiosks and the most expensive that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.410
was sold, I will continue to talk

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.090
about pessetas, because it was an

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.550
encyclopedia that cost 500 pessetas.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.070
What is happening?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.530
We made the channel because

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.150
the margin we gave the kiosk was

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.990
so big that selling a Plus account

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.790
earned the same as selling

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.250
all the newspapers El

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.810
País or El Mundo del Día.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.670
All those combinations came

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.750
up, we mortgaged our houses of

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.490
course, to make a television advertising

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.010
campaign, because as

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.110
it was massive, then I’

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.330
m telling you a little about

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.570
how it came up.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.310
We made a television campaign, we

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.810
recorded an ad with our friends

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.170
because we logically didn’t

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.410
have money, but of course, we had

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.510
to spend ads on television, that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.570
that cost a lot of money, for that

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.810
we had to mortgage the houses

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.730
because the media wholesalers

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.770
didn’t trust these gentlemen

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.010
and half and five, a quarter

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.910
prehistoric things for today.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.970
We prepared it, put it on the channels,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.790
distributed it and eventually

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.190
sold four million copies in

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.670
no way how many years.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.310
I have explained a little bit about

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.450
the key to success.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.990
The key was probably the change of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.710
equation.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.710
The market was mature, it was waiting

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.210
for a massive solution, it was one that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.770
didn’t know what that product was

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.430
for, it was calling by phone and there

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.510
was a person behind it who answered it.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.350
All these components together,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.410
that when you analyze

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.630
them individually are not

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.250
so important, but when you see

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.490
them in the concept you realize

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.650
that we had been able to suit

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.690
the needs of the demand that there

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.690
was exactly at that time.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.830
Alvaro has just explained it to us

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.890
in a spectacular way but I will

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.970
make a small summary.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.150
Back in the 1990s, the software

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.090
was bought by large companies because

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.230
it was a very expensive product and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.510
it was a product on a custom and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.590
Álvaro and his partner one

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.970
day decided that they

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.670
wanted to revolutionize this market

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.770
and that they wanted all the companies

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.550
in the world to buy a accounting

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.490
software and what they did is created

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.190
a much simpler product, much

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.750
cheaper and standard and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.930
also decided to sell it through

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.170
kiosks, something that was a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.330
spectacular idea and through

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.410
television campaigns,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.470
the software was not sold

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.670
through television campaigns

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.750
and through kiosks never

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.850
in life.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.170
Well the result, they sold

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.690
four million products,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.710
four million accountants and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.190
revolutionized a millionaire

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.530
market and now Álvaro will illustrate

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.570
the consequences

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.070
of a eruption of this

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.490
type.

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:50.350


00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.390
Well, because it started like that.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.950
This was, because only to give you

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.270
an anecdote, Borja, we had

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.310
not launched the advertisement

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.090
and sold all the products we had placed.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.850
And I saw myself watching the TV that

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.350
the ad was coming out and there were

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.450
no products, because they had already

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.210
sold all.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.570
And it took us more time to re-

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.190
write than the campaign lasted.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.170
That’s a crazy thing, right?

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.430
But, well, and that was the ball,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.970
wasn’t it?

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.610
So what happens?

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.490
That what we did was reinvest

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.710
all that amount of money that

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.030
came into us every day, create

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.750
a support, a service that would

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.630
support all that success and

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.490
that was the key to maintenance.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.730
That is, we did not see it

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.050
really as a ballot, we saw

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.350
it as we were meeting the needs

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.850
that the Spanish society

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.770
in the SMEs was demanding.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.030
We had a problem and it was that every

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.130
three months the buildings

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.610
were getting small.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.710
I remember in the Pradillo street

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.230
behind the world we picked up

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.030
a 2,000-meter building and

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.150
we said, and how long will

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.690
this last?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.150
I said, man, this takes us five or ten

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.730
years.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.750
In 6 months we sold it and

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.930
went to a 5,000 meter and

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.490
then a 10,000 meter, because

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.650
our call centers, of course,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.470
we received 15,000 calls

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.550
a day.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.530
We went with Operation Triunfo,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.990
the only ones in Spain that

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.870
collapsed the Spanish telephone

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.790
lines during the change of 2000.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.050
You remember that it seemed like everything

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.430
was going to stop because computers

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.330
were changing.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.070
At that time, we had over

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.210
400,000 customers in Spain.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.050
They decided to call us almost

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.890
all at once and we collapsed

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.870
the Spanish phone nodes.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.730
He called us and told us what

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.770
was going on?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.270
We don’t have enough lines for all

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.630
the people who are trying to

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.350
get into you.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.430
This has not only stopped us with

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.950
Operation Triumph and with you.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.170
So what you imagine.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.650
So back a little to your question,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.310
it was a series of circumstances

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.650
in which we were able to

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.030
meet what the market demanded

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.690
at that time.
