WEBVTT

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.250
Well, like everything else in this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.290
life, the planets were aligned and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.850
many things happened and apart from

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.350
we were at the right time,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.770
prepared and the market demanded it.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.510
All of these things until

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.990
happen, there is really no success in

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.670
any business.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.410
First I am going to tell you a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.870
anecdote because it was very curious.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.980
Conta Plus grew out of a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.070
dentist who commissioned us a

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.490
program and did not like it.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.370
He commissioned us to develop a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330
accounting for your business as

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.250
dentist and when we deliver it to you

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.070
did not like it.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.910
And then from that core of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.390
accounting that emerged from this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.570
dentist, we start working

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.910
on an accounting program.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.110
And at that moment came the idea and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.450
the idea was as its engineer,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.430
always everything mathematically,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.990
came from an equation in which

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.510
you said we sell 500

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.170
programs at 300 thousand pesetas.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.530
I'm talking about those that when

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.090
we lived in pesetas we sold 500

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.250
programs at 300 thousand pesetas.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.610
What happens if with the same equation

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.130
change the members of the equation?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.430
And we sell 300,000 programs at 500 pesetas.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.330
In the end, the economic amount is the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.570
same, but the formula is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.270
totally different.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.670
Well, this idea came up one night

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.110
between me and my partner and it was

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.210
exactly what we did.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.150
What we did is that a product

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.930
which cost at that time 300

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.490
thousand pesetas, we are talking about

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
better than 8 thousand euros today, then

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.250
we sold it for 4950 pesetas.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.170
And then instead of selling 500

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.970
products, as the idea was to sell

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.170
100 thousand products.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.690
This idea was born in our head

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570
as they arise in entrepreneurs

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.830
of these ideas that invade you and your

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370
life disappears, that's all you see.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.570
And then at the moment when

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.010
that idea came up, in our lives

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.030
there was nothing else.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.710
There was no family, there was nothing.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.210
And we started working on

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.330
transform that equation.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030
The first thing we said is how

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.150
we can sell 300 thousand products

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.230
of something that is not massive?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670
We said, where do the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.690
people every day?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.410
What is the usual sales channel?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.850
Newspaper kiosks.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.570
Well, we said, they are the kiosks of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.030
our point of sale.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.530
Never before in my life has

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.510
sold at newsstands.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.430
What can we sell in the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.050
newspaper kiosks?

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.270
At what price can we sell?

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.390
So we went to a kiosk of

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.590
newspaper, we went to several

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.810
newspaper kiosks and most importantly

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.410
expensive to sell, I will continue to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.090
speaking of pesetas, because it was a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.550
encyclopedia that cost 500 pesetas.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.070
What's up?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.530
That we took over the channel

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.150
because the margin we gave to the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.990
The kiosk keeper was so large that with

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.790
Conta Plus earned the same amount of money as

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.250
same as with selling all the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.810
newspapers El País or El Mundo del Día.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.670
All these combinations

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.750
emerged, we mortgaged our

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.490
houses, of course, to make a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.010
advertising campaign in

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.110
television, because as it was

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.330
massive, then I'm telling you

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.570
a little bit about how it came about.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.310
We did a television campaign,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.810
we were shooting a commercial with friends

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.170
because, logically, we do not

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.410
we had money, but of course, there was

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.510
than running commercials on television,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.570
that it cost a lot of money,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.810
to do so, we had to mortgage

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.730
houses because the wholesalers of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.770
the media did not rely on these

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.010
one and a half and five and a quarter

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.910
prehistoric things for today.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.970
We prepared it, put it in the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.790
channels, we distribute it and

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.190
we finally sold four million

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.670
copies in I don't know how many years.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.310
But a little bit I have explained which one

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.450
was the key to success.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.990
The key was probably the change

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.710
of equation.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.710
The market was mature, it was

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.210
waiting for a massive solution, it was

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.770
one that did not know what it was for

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.430
that product, he would call on the phone

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.510
and there was a person behind him who answered.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.350
All these components together,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.410
that when you analyze them

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.630
individually, they are not as

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.250
important, but when you see them

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.490
in the concept you realize that

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.650
we had been able to adapt

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.690
the needs of the demand that

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.690
was exactly at that time.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.830
Álvaro has just told us about

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.890
spectacular but I'm going to

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.970
to make a brief summary.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.150
Let's go back to the 1990s, the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.090
software was purchased by companies

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.230
because it was a very large product because it was a very

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.510
expensive and was a tailor-made product and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.590
Alvaro and his partner one day

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.970
decided they wanted to

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.670
revolutionize this market and that

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.770
wanted all the companies in the

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.550
world could buy a software

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.490
and what they did

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.190
es created a product that is much more

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.750
simple, much cheaper and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.930
standard and also decided to

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.190
sold through kiosks, which is a

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.330
that it was a spectacular idea and

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.410
through campaigns in

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.490
television, the software will not be

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.670
sold through campaigns in

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.750
television and through kiosks

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.850
never in life.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.190
Well the result, they reached

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.670
sell four million

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.710
products, four million

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.190
and revolutionized a

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.530
million-dollar market and now Álvaro

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.550
will enlighten us on the

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.070
consequences of an eruption of

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.710
this type.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.190
And so it began, this was

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.870
just to give you an anecdote

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.070
Borja, we had not launched the

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.770
advertising and sold all the

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.910
products that we had placed and

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.870
I could see myself watching television

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.350
that the announcement came out and there was no

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.470
products because they had already been

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.670
sold all and redeem

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.370
cost us more time than what we

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.410
the campaign lasted, i.e. one thing already

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.890
not crazy but good and so on

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.630
it was the ball no then what happens

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.450
that at that time we did not turn

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.530
crazy and what we did is

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.730
reinvest all that amount

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.050
of money coming in for all of us

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.730
days to create a support a

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.650
service that would support all that

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.570
success and that was the key to

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.810
maintenance, i.e. we do not

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.430
we really saw that as a

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.770
ball we saw it as we were

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.350
in response to the needs that

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.170
Spanish society in SMEs

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.330
was demanding we had a

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.530
problem is that every three months

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.530
buildings, that is to say, it is one thing to

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.690
I remember the pradillo street behind

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.770
of the world we took a building of

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.850
2,000 meters and we said and this

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.030
how long will it last I said

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.330
man this lasts us 5 10 years in

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.770
six months we sold it and we

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.050
we went to one of 5,000 meters and of

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.450
well, to one of 10,000 meters because

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.510
our call centers claro

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.490
we received 15,000

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.490
calls a day we went with

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.470
operation triumph the only ones in

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.710
Spain that collapsed the lines

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.470
Spanish telephone companies during

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.070
at the time of the 2000 changeover

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.070
you remember that it seemed that everything

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.450
was going to stop because they were changing

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.490
the computers of course at that time

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.170
at that time we had more than 400,000

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.290
customers in spain therefore decided to

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.450
almost all of us at the same time and

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.630
we collapsed the telephone nodes

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.470
Spanish called us on the phone and

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.350
told us what's going on there

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.270
we have enough lines to

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.670
all the people who are trying to

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.990
This will not only be a

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.310
has stopped with operation triumph and

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.230
with you, so imagine

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.670
so going back a bit to your

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.330
question were a series of

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.670
circumstances in which we were

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.050
able to attend to what in that

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.690
the market demanded
