WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.600
The leadership and organization

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.960
test has 23 questions

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.920
and requires 16 answers.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.920


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.260
What is our purpose?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.040
What is what we do?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.900
This is the mission.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.220
Remember, vision is where we

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.140
want to get and values are the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.900
principles we rule ourselves by.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.340
So that is the mission.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.660
What are the values that help us?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.700
In this case, we have

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.060
to choose the wrong answer.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.020
The wrong thing is this, being more

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.500
efficient in the use of resources.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.180
Values don't help you be more efficient.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.160
Values help you create a more

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.760
powerful brand, connecting

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880
better with all stakeholders,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.120
employees, customers,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.040
etc.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.180
This is the wrong answer.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.660
What can we do to not lose height

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.280
and not fall into the mud, to

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.580
get out of the mud?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.660
Do not lose sight of the vision and the emission.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.620
Yes, it is very important.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.920
We need to be clear about what we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.280
are doing and where we want to go.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.740
This prevents us from getting confused on a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.220
daily basis.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.700
Start each week by doing

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.140
an analysis of the most important

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.220
and allowing us to focus during

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.320
that week on the important.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.420
Yes it makes sense.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.140
Use systems such as OKR to

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.580
guide the entire organization

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.300
towards strategic goals.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.560
I think these are three very good advice.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.460
The most functional structures,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.460
what is happening?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.100
Well, remember that when you divide

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.100
your organization by functions,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.380
marketing, finance, etc.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.600
One of the biggest disadvantages is

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.160
that there is very poor

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.720
communication between departments.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.920
Per the other disadvantage is that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.400
the organization is not well-

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.740
oriented to results.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.690
What kind of structures contribute

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.510
more to efficiency, to be more

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.390
efficient?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.990
hierarchy or the clan.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.950
More efficient are the more hierarchical

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.190
cultures where there is much

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.510
control, that the processes

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.870
are very defined, etc.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.980
We are looking for efficiency.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.680
In this case, what we are looking for

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.360
is effectiveness, which is to results.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.400
What would you choose, an adocratic

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.880
structure or a clanic structure?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.720
I would choose an adocratic structure

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360
that is absolutely focused,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.420
has an external focus.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.300
What we want is to results.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.660
In many cases, in adocratic

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.020
cultures, what is sought are

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.980
very ambitious goals.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.980
In the previous paragraphs

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.140
we talked about efficiency

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.260
and efficiency.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.500
These are two concepts that you need to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.280
understand very well.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.940
When we seek efficiency we

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.260
have to choose one type of structures

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.340
and when we seek efficiency

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.180
for others.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.300
The financial institutions that are

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.160
engaged in commercial banking

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.760
usually what kind of culture do they have?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.220
They have market cultures

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.580
that are oriented towards

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.480
sales, growth.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.380
The entire business network is focused

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.240
on that.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.340
If you have a very ambitious

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.760
and very innovative project, what kind

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.720
of culture do you think you should choose?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.620
We put the four.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440
The best culture for a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.000
project of this type is adocratic.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.780


00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.620
When you try to get very good people,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.620
you give them a lot of flexibility

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.000
but you are very demanding

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.300
and you are constantly demanding

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.240
results.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480
They do not have to be

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.260
sales results.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.120
They can be results at the level of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.340
revolutionizing a sector, creating something

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.040
new, etc.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.380
Let's talk about the clan cultures.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.980
When does a clanique culture

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.540
centered on employee happiness

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300
and commitment make more sense?

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.980
When is it important to be

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.860
efficient or when it is important

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.840
to establish personal

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.320
relationships with employees?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.780
Clan cultures often make sense

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.060
in this second case.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.580
You do what you do is have your

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.200
employees very happy because you

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.320
think that's going to be passed

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.040
on to your customers.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.340
What kind of culture do you think it has?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.680
McDonald's is clearly a very

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.600
hierarchical culture.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.260
The entire network, all the points

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.420
of sale, all the McDonald's are

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.000
absolutely standardized that's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.300
what they have to do, etc.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.080
What are the risks of a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.000
highly delegative leadership

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.100
style you let do?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.680
That you have little control, that

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.280
productivity is low, that roles

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.720
are poorly defined.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.300
All of the above are risks

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.640
of this style of leadership.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.160
When does a delegative style like

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.140
the one we talked about before make sense?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.820
In organizations that are more

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.060
flat, with adocratic cultures, with

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.460
people very focused on results,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.600
very responsible, etc.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.820
Or in organizations that are very

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.500
functional and very vertical.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.340
Well, it is more common that the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.520
style is delegative in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.980
more adocratic organizations.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.110
What is the current trend?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.890
The current trend is that organizations

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.450
are increasingly structured by

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.850
very concrete projects, with

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.810
short-term results and more implementing

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.710
methodologies such as

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.970
Agile, for example, that

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.270
you already know.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.530
Organizations that are structured

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.910
by business lines, imagine,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.390
in different products

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.110
or by customer segments,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.190
whether they are functional

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.030
or are divisional.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.670
They are divisive.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.970
And those that are structured by geographies,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.030
how are they?

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.270
They are also divisive.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.510
The division is by geography,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.330
not by business line.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.770
Now let's talk about OKR, which

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.950
as you know we love.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.090
They must be quantifiable.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.550
What is quantifiable?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.310
Goals or key results?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.910
The key results.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.170
How many key results

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.590
should we have for each goal?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.670
Well, around between 3 and 5.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.050
What are the objectives they should be?

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.930
They must be illusory and retorical.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.490
They must be defined in cascade

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.330
from strategic objectives

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.530
and must be inspired by

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.790
the mission and vision of

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.870
the company, since all of

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.070
the above.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.370
What are the key

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.210
results for?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.530
To assess the performance of each

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.190
employee?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.550
Even if I can help you?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.130
Or to know if we are on the

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.550
right track to the goals?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.910
The key results are indicators

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.450
that we are getting closer

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.170
to those goals every

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.910
week.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.080
In managing a project by

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.540
Yael, we must make an initial effort

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.000
to define the final scope.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.340
Is this correct or is it false?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.880
Well, because it is false.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.480
Because basically what you have

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.480
to remember is that we started

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.960
from the principle that we don't

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.680
really know what the ultimate

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.280
reach is, what the ultimate goal is.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.440
We need to go very quickly

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.720
and very quickly and make

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.080
mistakes very quickly.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.720
Because we cannot give, of

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.880
course, in an environment of

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.900
uncertainty that we know that is

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.940
what will happen.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.640
Yael's philosophy helps us to define

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.780
the goals, deadlines and resources

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.160
of a project very well.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.680
But no, it helps us to move forward

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.600
at the moment when we are

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.040
aware that we have been wrong.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.490
Let's see what the principles

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.970
of Yael are when we talk about

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.350
project management.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.310
In this case, the question what

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.210
tells us is that we have

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.070
to select the wrong option.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.710
Working in short cycles.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.770
It is a recommendation that we make.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.070
Remember, we work on cycles, for

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.890
example, in sprints, which

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.290
we talk about one week, two weeks,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.990
with deliverables within that

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.570
sprint.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.970
And what allows us to know permanently

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.110
whether we are going in the right direction

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.350
or not.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.730
We must go ahead to the moment when

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.250
we know whether we have been wrong or not.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.490
It also allows us to focus a lot,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.630
week by week, always on the

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.490
most important.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.470
Create multidisciplinary and autonomous teams.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.130
This is another of the recommendations they have

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.330
given us.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.750
What you can't do is create teams

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.830
that depend on others, because you'll

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.170
make the project fail.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.870
Work with a very defined scope.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.750
This is not Yale, this is the opposite.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.510
Remember, we start from the assumption

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.790
that we are facing a lot of uncertainty.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.550
We cannot plan the entire project

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.630
long-term because we don't

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.610
know what's going to happen.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.890
We have to go forward in very

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.070
short sprints.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.550
Being close to the customer?

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.890
and yes.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.370
Focus on the important?

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.730
and yes.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.530
Therefore, the answer we

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.830
have to select wrong is to work

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.750
with a very well-defined

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.390
range.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.590
The Scrum Master is the person

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.910
responsible for, in this case, ensuring

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.810
that the rest of the organization,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.330
the team, etc., complies with

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.650
the Scrum methodology.
