WEBVTT

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.500
Now what we are concerned with is

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.920
to make the effort to understand very,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.700
very well our customers, each of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.720
the customer people.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
What is the goal here?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.280
I do not want us to disappear.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.320
The goal here is not to make a very chula

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.640
ficha with the customer person and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.180
so that it does not serve for anything.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.000
The goal is that you acquire such

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.960
a brutal knowledge of your target

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.120
market and your customers,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.660
so brutal that you can

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.020
adapt the proposal.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.420
They are not able to understand

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.780
their customers well because every time

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.340
you learn you get ideas about how

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.780
to adapt the proposal.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.340
And I tell you that if you don't do

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.520
it, if you haven't adapted the value

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.820
proposal, if you don't have customer

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.540
insights, it's because you're not learning.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.080
But something super-traxical, super-

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.120
practical and you can do tomorrow

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.460
is that when you understand your

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.300
customers well it's so easy, so

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.040
easy to adapt your messages.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.960
Ads, putting an ad on TV or

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.680
on a Facebook H is that suddenly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.160
you go to sellers will

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.540
sell more, etc.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080
It's that it's easy to do that when

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.200
you understand your customer

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.040
well, when you know what's behind it.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.820
You'll invest better in marketing,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.320
etc., and basically the conclusion

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.680
of all this is that you'll sell

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.620
a lot more.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.680
The goal is to sell a

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.540
lot more.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.900
It's not just about customer

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.460
marketing and so on.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.100
What is what happens?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.760
People don't know very well, they don't know

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.320
how to do this.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.620
Why is it?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.020
Because they don't know what they have

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.380
to learn from customers.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.380
And also, because it is not easy.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.240
I tell you that this is not easy.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.560
We know how to do it well.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.920
And every time we make the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.000
effort, sales, lists and everything

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.460
multiplies, but we know

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.240
it's hard.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.840
So what is the key?

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.960
The key is that they are two.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.220
First, that you have the vocation to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.360
do it, that you believe this is important

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.460
because otherwise you will not

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.860
do it.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.140
People are inertia forgetting

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.540
their customers.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.560
Second, you know what you need

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.960
to look for from customers.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.880
That is, what is what you have to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.620
analyze of each of those customer

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.860
people you already have.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.960
We have a list that I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.760
will comment on above.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.980
They are like different perspectives

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.480
or different issues that we

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.640
recommend that you all take into

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.540
account, but that some will apply

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.160
more or apply less in your case.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.920
This is not a closed list, right?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.800
We do not want closed shelves.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.960
So what you have to do is

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.620
analyze each of your customer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.180
people from all these

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.860
issues and fill it in.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.500
And write it, share it, and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.840
mature it every day.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.820
Every day is the same is an

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.300
exaggeration, but really mature

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.000
it and do it continuously.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.040
Every time you learn, I tell

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.360
you.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.500
That is, every time we do it,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.960
every time we make the effort

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.160
to better understand customers,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.220
we realize that we have to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.680
change a lot of things and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.600
when we do it we sell

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.260
a lot more.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.160
So we recommend that everyone

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.820
do it.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.980
Let's start with the list.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.480
The list of factors you have to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.920
include or analyze of each person

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.460
has as multiple perspectives.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.620
And let's start with how to analyze

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.820
the customer itself, how to describe it.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.440
You should describe it from

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.360
a demographic perspective.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.600
I don't know where you work, where you work,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.200
what kind of things.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.440
You have to understand something about that.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.560
You can describe a little bit

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.600
of his biography, his past, his family,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.120
that kind of things that can help

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.520
you understand him a little better.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.860
Your profile, your lifestyle, those things

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.840
that if you are an adventurer, traveler,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.140
that kind of things.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.100
their attitude to certain things.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.160
Remember, for example, when

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.700
we talked about PowerMJ, the attitude

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.620
to learn is important here.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.960
Sometimes they are important.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.340
Every client, every customer, every customer, every customer, every customer,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860
every customer, every customer, every customer, every customer, every customer.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.420
And I have included this, which

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.800
is objective, challenges, problems,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.980
and is trying to understand for our

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.220
clients what are the important

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.380
things in their lives.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.980
We are not talking about ourselves yet.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.760
Important to him or her, what is

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.380
it that concerns him, why he would

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.720
pay a lot of money, etc.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.840
Well, as you can see, all these

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.440
factors help us to have a picture

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000
of the person itself.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.460
You of a friend could

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.520
explain this.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.720
For a person you know you would be

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.320
able to, because that, it is that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.200
you contextualize more, because

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.160
you understand a little more your client

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.040
from these perspectives, than they

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.960
apply in your case.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.560
Now let's go to this, which I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.640
think is more important.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.160
Instead, customer person templates

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.400
usually focus on what is above,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.900
to describe the person, that if

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.520
you consult Facebook, that

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.640
if you team us, it is that

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.680
the potent here I think it is

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.840
what we enter now.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.260
And it will help us to understand

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.240
our customers much more deeply in

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.800
their relationship with us and will

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.060
help us a lot to change the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.280
proposal, messages and more.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.580
We need to understand why they buy

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.760
us, why they don't buy us.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.580
We have included these perspectives.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.260
The first one is very broad, but

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.680
I think the most important one is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.720
that you have to do it.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.520
We force, look, in calls,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.660
all commercials, etc.,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.820
we force this to be filled

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.000
up always.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.460
You have to understand

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.980
what the customer has.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.060
This is sometimes not easy to

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.220
understand or what the benefit

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.960
it seeks in you.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.960
Why do you buy you?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.020
Go to the bottom of the matter.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.820
There is always one for what?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.960
There is always one for why, one

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.920
why behind when someone buys

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.520
something?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.200
There is always.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.060
Sometimes it's something more complex,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.340
deeper, other times it's something more

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.340
superfluous, but there's always one

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.740
for what.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.540
There is always.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.040
The reason you buy a shirt,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460
the reason you buy a watch,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.660
the reason you buy a master,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.440
the reason you buy a trip,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.940
there is always a why, a

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.940
why.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.340
If you don't understand it, the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.000
reason is very powerful.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.640
Remember that at The Power Envié we

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.160
told you that there were people who

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.140
bought what they were to

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.300
inspire and maybe someday change

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.800
their lives and launch a company.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.360
But in the meantime, you know?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.540
These things have to go to the bottom,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.420
to the bottom.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.220
The Stopers.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.000
This is harder to understand, but sometimes

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.920
there are things that are stopping

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.000
or limiting your customers.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.220
Your customers have goals, but

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.040
something stops them or dislikes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.880
them or annoys them or annoys them.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.240
I put the example of The Power

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.420
Send Again that you imagine,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.440
the stopper of those dreamer

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.720
who have dreams but don't

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.140
have time, no money, don't know

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.360
where to start, those are the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.100
stopers.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.580
If you are able to identify which

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.900
are those stopers that are limiting

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.740
or worrying your customers

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.860
and you advance them messages,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.460
you will sell a lot more.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.540
So imagine, I don't know, I'm in the fashion

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.940
industry or something like that,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.500
because there's someone who

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.080
doesn't find certain things.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.620
I don't know how to dress, because that'

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.220
s the stopper.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.320
It is very expensive to find.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.460
If you know it, you can get

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.920
ahead and you will connect

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.980
a lot more.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.380
Alternatives, what is it?

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.640
Customers usually have

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.260
a problem or they are looking

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.500
for something and there are

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.300
alternatives.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.240
They can buy you, but they

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.140
can also buy from the competition

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.220
or they can do it themselves,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.400
etc.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.360
We'll think of a coach that

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.400
offers services for managers, for

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.160
me I know, with mindfulness,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.480
to be more focused.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.720
I am talking about the march.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.160
What are the alternatives these

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.700
leaders have?

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.340
Well, then imagine, one that I think of

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.540
is, because reading books or things like

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.240
that, right?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.360
Or practice them alone.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.700
It is an alternative.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.140
And you imagine that the coach knows

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.220
that those managers who are their

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.280
target audience, those

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.560
alternatives they are resorting

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.720
to, because I know, they do not

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.060
convince them by whatever, that the

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.440
books are not practical.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.620
So, the coach uses it as a message,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.480
stop reading books of I don't know what

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.140
and I help you to do so, you know?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.740
And if that's true, if it's true that

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.360
the customer is resorting to an alternative

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.460
that isn't convincing him and

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.180
the coach advances, because

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.760
it's that imagine it, it'll connect

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.680
phenomenal with the customer.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.720
Another thing we recommend you to

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.320
analyze is everything you offer,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.980
because all the companies in the

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.420
world offer many things or

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.080
many values.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.460
We offer, I know, because success

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.160
cases, 15 minutes a day, work

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.060
bag, such, because in a restaurant

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.640
will have many values.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.120
So that's nice, drinking drinks, that

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.780
the food is good, I don't know, you know?

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.620
There are many things.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.780
Within every value proposition there

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.540
are many values.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.080
It is good that from each customer

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.520
person you analyze what are the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.400
results that there are things you

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.360
offer, that you think that people

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.740
value and nobody values it, so

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.160
you will have until you get

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.360
it out of the value proposal.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.700
This may be related to the

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.000
profit they buy you for,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.600
right?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.620
It may be related, but it's

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.260
good to do it from all perspectives.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.940
efforts and costs.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.220
Sometimes value proposals involve

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.640
an effort or cost that does

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.580
not have to be economical from

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.700
the customer's perspective.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.440
For the gym is that you have to go

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.040
to the gym and spend an hour, I know,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.380
or it's far away or you have

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.060
to park.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.180
I always give an example because it is

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.120
very well understood.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.560
Understanding them from the client'

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.260
s perspective, what is the effort

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.740
that it implies to him or her or them?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.740
What is the effort?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.000
Because when you understand it, in addition

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.800
to that you can lower that effort,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.340
at the value proposal level, you

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.840
can look for it, imagine if you are

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.120
a gym chain, if people are struggling

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.320
to park, because you have to

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.360
look for places where it can

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.680
be easily parked, I know, I don'

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.140
t know.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.920
But at the level of marketing, as you

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.020
know people are costing that, because

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.580
you can sympathize more with them,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.840
you can know they will have that

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.580
objection, etc., and the

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.500
advertisers will help them.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.780
Another important point, how do you

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.700
see your customers, that customer

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.300
person, how do you see the market

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.940
in relation to the competition?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.380
Because often you have an idea

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.560
and your competitors, but it is

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.200
that customers perceive it differently.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.880


00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.720
Why are they buying you?

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.900
Why not buy you?

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.800
Or if they buy you, what do they

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.980
value, what do they think is better

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.200
than the competition?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.900
You know, this is very powerful, what

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.600
is it that you don't like about the competition?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.000
Is it related to the alternatives

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.080
above?

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.260
There are many things that are

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.320
related, but it is good to

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.960
have all the perspectives.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.520
It's fine that you understand this,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.820
customers now or buy competitors,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.200
but it's that they don't like

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.140
this from competitors,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.860
I know, you know?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.760
Because the masters are not practical,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.000
because it's great, you already understand,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.220
that people have that in their

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.260
heads and then you advance.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.720
All this we have seen, all these

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.100
perspectives of analysis, if you

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.780
are able to know how all that

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.320
speech, how it is inside the

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.740
minds of people, with what words

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.920
they express it, the masters

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.860
are a connage, I know, you know?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.600
That is the last example we'

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.400
ve talked about, but all that,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.040
the problems they have, why

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.880
buy you, another?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.960
What are they doing now?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.680
If you are able to explain it with

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.040
the words they have in their head,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.800
you don't know how it will improve

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.120
the results of everything you do,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.020
it's that copies, the web, the

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.320
ads, everything will improve

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.800
a lot, because people connect

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.780
with that.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.560
If I am a client of a coach and it turns

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.680
out that I am tired of reading books

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.460
of I don't know what, and you tell

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.060
me and I see it on the web, I stop reading

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.460
books of such and I help you and I

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.880
find that I identify with that, because

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.680
it's that you imagine, you know?

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.620
I will leave the data.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.540
Conversation in the mind of the

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.600
client, we'll learn to do this,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.420
you know?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.680
To identify them and create copies or

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.080
messages that will be adapted, we

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.060
will see examples.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.940
Any other things that would be

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940
good to know about each of the

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.820
customer people?

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.860
These are probably easier.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.760
So, what are the channels

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.820
through which we can

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.780
get to them?

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.360
This is easier, because what media

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.440
consult, if you use social media,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.680
television, this, the other, you know?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.660
Offline or whatever.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.920
When you understand your client

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.620
well, it's easy.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.020
How do you make the decision?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.060
This is very well.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.180
Analyses in the decision process, in that

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.280
customer journey, in the customer

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.380
journey, from when he knows you until

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.740
he makes the decision, how does

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.760
he make the decision?

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.580
What steps do you take?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.620
What are you looking for?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.960
What worries him?

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.880
The objections.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.120
The objections the customer

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.160
has, this is very important.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.460
It is related to the above, but

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.720
if you are able to identify

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.020
the objections of each of the customer

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.700
people, it is that you will

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.820
sell a lot more, because

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.300
you will advance.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.880
Another issue is influencers, which

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.280
is related to how it makes the decision,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.820
who participates in the buying

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.360
process, who consults and

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.640
more.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.700
There are sometimes people who

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.020
are involved in this process, which is

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.800
not a single person.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.880
Well, it's good to identify

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.300
it because it will help you a lot.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.880
And you also have to understand

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.060
customers, you have to make the

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.220
effort to understand them how

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.300
they act as customers after buying.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.700
How you use our product, how and

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.960
when you use it.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.140
This is OK.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.600
It may be related to what, but

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.800
there will be different customer

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.120
person who use you in one

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.660
way.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.120
Remember the haircut.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.360
Because there are people who go back

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.540
and forth because their hair grows and

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.520
there is also another use that is for

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.360
an event, I know.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.120
The girls at a wedding on Saturday

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.940
morning, I don't know.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.420
What do you expect and what do you get?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.620
What are the expectations you have?

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.920
What is your customer experience

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.420
and what is your customer

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.740
satisfaction level?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.340
Are they loyal customers?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.080
Is it faithful or not?

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.060
Buy only once?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.320
Are they recommended?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.960
Are they viral?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.680
Well, they are perspectives that you

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.260
have to analyze and you have to

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.200
analyze for each of the customer

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.280
person because it will give you

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.040
a lot of information.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.300
We have already seen them all.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.580
I would recommend you take all of

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.920
this into account, even if it

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920
seems like they are a lot.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.660
I assure you, you'll be

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.300
a lot better in marketing

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.780
if you can really answer

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.420
all of this.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.360
So many things will happen to you.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.360
Evolve your proposal, new

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.740
messages, etc.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.600
So do it.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.480
Take into account all, analyze each

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.000
customer person from all of them and

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.820
write them, write them and

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.140
share and reflect on them, etc.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.420
Grow it up because the information

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.760
it will give you will absolutely

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.520
change how you address them.
