WEBVTT

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.530
One of the biggest benefits you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.030
will take from Power MBA and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.890
I would love it, I would generate

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.230
a lot of satisfaction that it

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.970
was so, is that you could really

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.510
analyze a business model in

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.550
depth and if you are able to do

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.890
so, I guarantee you will help

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.770
you a lot in your professional career.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.010
To better understand the company in

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.490
which you are working or your own

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.070
company or if you are proposed or are

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.970
identified if it is interesting

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.810
or not or if you have money

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.550
and you want to invest in another

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.850
person's company, in a startup

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.330
or whatever, it will help

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.170
you a lot to make right

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.470
decisions.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.170
I also want to tell you that understanding

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.570
the business in depth is not something

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.590
that you learn from night to morning,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.750
it is not just a matter of learning

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.030
theory like what we will learn

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.750
today, but it is a matter of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.070
going to mature it, of going

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.410
to assimilate and learn with

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.390
time, right?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.250
But well, I am convinced that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.290
we will end up getting it because

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.710
we will see many cases, for a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.970
long time we will comment

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.570
on many things and I think

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.450
this type of knowledge and practice

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.010
will go quiet.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.010
Well, what we are concerned with today

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.450
is the phase of analyzing a business

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.710
model and what I propose to you,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.210
what I am going to propose is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.290
a model that is a model created by

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.630
me, which are a series of factors

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.290
that I consider important when thinking

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.230
about a business model.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.670
This framework or this model I do

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.350
not intend to be the definitive,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.970
but well, I think it is

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.530
enriching, I think that if you start

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.710
incorporating this type of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.890
perspectives in your analysis you

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.230
will improve a lot, it will improve

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.930
a lot your understanding of a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.890
business model, right?

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.490
You don't need to remember them

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.250
today because we're going to leave

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.770
them, right?

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.690
So what I propose is that a series

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.970
of factors and that the methodology

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.750
consists in evaluating them from

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.450
0 to 10.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.930
Let's start today, what we'll

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.810
see are the factors.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.160
We start and we will relate it in

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.000
many cases with Regarding customer

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280
elements, what is important

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800
that you think about what you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.200
look at?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800
Well, because I believe, as Hugo

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440
Arevalo, president of Hawkers,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.620
will later reinforce us,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.080
that I will share with you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.240
one of the talks we have had,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720
I think it is very important

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.100
to look for business that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.680
is big.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.680
You have to think about the size of the market.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.340
If you're going to a small market,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.540
well, you might have a profitable

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.920
business, but it's never going

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.060
to be a big business, it's never

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.100
going to be a big company, right?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.180
I'll put you, to illustrate

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.060
these factors I'll use the example

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.900
of your lottery, which is a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.360
mobile app where you can buy

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.620
lottery through the app, which

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.680
connects with authorized sellers,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.620
because it's a case I know

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.780
well because I'm a partner

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.000
investor.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
The lottery.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.860
The lottery market is huge, the lottery

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.120
market is immense, it is a millionaire,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.480
it is the lottery market in

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.900
the world, it is a very

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.960
big, a very strong strength of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.240
the business model.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.000
and scalability.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.260
Let us go to the second point.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.340
Is the business model scalable?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.540
Well, we've seen it in the previous

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.320
class and it's something that depends,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.880
as we've seen, on different factors

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.800
and requires a good analysis.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520
Your lottery is scalable, I will

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.920
give you an example again.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.660
Your lottery is very scalable because

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.800
the technology that your lottery has

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680
can be used in many countries around

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.920
the world, as long as your lottery

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.620
is in full international

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.020
expansion, which is proof that

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.500
the model is scalable.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.420
barriers to entry.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.260
The entrance barriers is an important

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.920
concept that you have to understand

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.340
very well and we will dedicate

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.900
specific classes to the entrance

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.580
barriers.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.400
Entrance barriers depend on many

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.740
factors within the business

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.120
model, so I've drawn it all

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.180
out, but when a business has

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.960
strong entry barriers it's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.740
a company that's worth a lot

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.640
more.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.160
Look, Warren Buffett illustrates

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.260
it very well, says one that is

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.140
surrounding a castle and he also

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.740
says he only invests in

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.280
that have that pit and over

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.720
it full of sharks, right?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.820
It is very representative of what

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.740
is an entry barrier.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.460
The fountain that makes you

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.180
protected from your competitors and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.020
that generates greater profitability.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.980
Regarding the value proposal to the

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.020
offer of products and services,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.000
well, because there is a very clear

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.940
question that is whether we

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.420
create value, if we are offering

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.760
value, above all it is a very

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.920
important question when you face

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.540
an innovative business

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.740
model, it is the most important.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.940
I think when a business brings

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.680
value, when a business solves

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.760
a problem that exists, it's very

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.320
easy to build a profitable

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.580
business model from that,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.280
right?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.580
The focus should be value.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.700
When I first sat down with the CEO

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.980
and founder of your lottery and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.280
explained the business model to

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.660
me, I understood the value

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.840
instantly, that is, it's an

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.440
app that lets you buy lotteries

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.140
without having to go to the establishment.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.020
It is clear.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.400
From that, as I said, it is very easy

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.780
to create a business model

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.580
that is profitable, but you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.500
always have to start with

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.920
customer value.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.060
An application like Glovo, for

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.220
example, that allows you to quickly

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.760
request shipments, for example,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.160
from mailings in your own city,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.180
that bring you a package,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.240
etc., in a very simple way.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.460
It brings a lot of value.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560
You use it twice and you immediately understand

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.300
it, right?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.560
And I think, as I said, it

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.540
is important to get out of here.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.560
And it is the focal point, the creation of value.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.600
One important concept I would

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.820
like you to understand is exchange

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.620
costs.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.580
There are business models, or in

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.420
particular there are products and services

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.100
offers.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.180
There are products that are very easy

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.500
to change from supplier.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.220
You are paying the light to

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.320
a certain company and tomorrow you

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.420
call another, you change it and you

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.940
don't realize.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.520
You do it in ten minutes,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.760
just the next month you will get

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.720
a letter from another company

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.200
that there is no exchange

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.980
cost.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.840
However, there are products

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.160
and services where the exchange

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.960
cost is very high.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.580
And that is a huge strength for

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.520
the business model.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.940
If you sell software, for example,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.560
let's go to the case of Account

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.140
Plus, to facilitate, I put

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.860
examples that we all know.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.160
Software of accounting.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.740
If you have an implemented accounting

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.180
software in your company, I won'

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.680
t tell you that it's impossible that

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.500
you are very complicated because

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.040
your employees use it, you are

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.800
used to it, your advisor uses it, etc.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.480
So for Plus Account or for

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.520
Saje, who is currently the

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.940
Plus Account owner, this is

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.140
a huge strength.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.700
I have been a strategic consultant

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.020
for Saje in particular and have

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.880
seen how even customers who were

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.480
absolutely dissatisfied do not

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.300
change for that exchange cost,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.940
for that lock-in effect we are

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.380
talking about.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.900
We go with the flow of income.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.200
There are things that are obvious.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.040
Whether the income is higher,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.320
higher or lower, but I will not

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.500
go to the obvious.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.820
I'll go to factors that are more

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.140
enriching that I want you to learn.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.360
And you have to start thinking about

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.380
this, in the recurrence.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.860
It is very important to recurrent

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.460
income in a business model.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.300
Do you remember we were talking about subscription?

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.780
The subscription model.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.620
Well, the subscription

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.320
model is very beneficial because

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.280
it allows you to have a huge recurrence

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.500
with customers.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.780
Reduces the risk.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.220
It's easier to anticipate what you'

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.860
re going to earn the next year, etc.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.500
Let's look at the recurrence in your

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.280
lottery.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.480
Your lottery charges for each

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.400
ticket you sell.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.500
It is not a fixed quota.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.680
However, the income is very recurring.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.620
Why is?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.280
Because when a player gets

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.520
used to buying a lottery game,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.780
the EuroMillions, for example,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.500
every week, the recurring income

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.920
generated by your lottery

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.120
is very high.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.240
We must always think of recurrence.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.640
Let's go to the costs.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.400
Now, let's go to the cost structure.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.540
Here sometimes it is necessary to analyze

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.160
whether the business model

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.580
is generating an absolute disruption

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.420
in costs.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.160
If so, it is a fortress,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.080
right?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.900
The case of the super, which we will

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.400
analyze in detail with its

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.920
founder, is a clear example of how

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.780
by innovating in the business

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.060
model they can save a lot

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.540
in the cost structure in relation

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.160
to all their competition.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.340
This is another factor you need

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.000
to analyze.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.640
Competitive advantage with

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.480
huge cost savings.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.440
Well, if so, it is clear that one

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.240
has to put a huge more because

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.460
it is a clear strength of the model.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.000
Now let's go to a very important

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.060
concept that is sometimes not

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.560
so easy to analyze and is the

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.600
cash flow.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.780
How is the cash flow of this

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.640
business model?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.540
The cash flow of the operations

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.840
stage, the operations

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.980
are generating cash daily,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.300
a lot of treasury is generated

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.720
or the opposite.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.200
That would be the analysis, let's say,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.700
more simple, right?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.180
But it is something very important.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.240
I give you examples.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.940
Haukers is another case that we know well.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.620
One of his keys to success was that

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.980
he financed his growth by the huge

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.460
margin that they had on glasses.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.080
With every glasses he sold he earned a

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.840
very high percentage that he managed

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.360
to reinvest in marketing and that made

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.940
it grow very quickly.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:19.980
Is it worth?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.960
The cash flow in this case, I ask

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.580
you the customer, right?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.560
And I'll go to another case, in your lottery

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.480
case, we'll come back.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.060
In the case of your lottery, cash

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.540
flow is not so beneficial.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.340
Why is?

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.480
Because, as I said, you generate

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.460
a recurring income throughout

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.260
the customer's life, but not a hit.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.880
Then the cash flow, you first have

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.800
to spend money on capturing

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.500
that customer and then recover

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.640
it throughout their life.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.700
Do you understand a little about what I want to go?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.620
It is necessary to analyze the, it is necessary

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.400
to do an analysis of the cash flow at

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.280
this level.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.060
Whether the company is rapidly

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.080
generating treasury or not, or it needs

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.400
to invest to recover it in the long

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.420
term, in the medium term.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.680
A very clear analysis is the margins.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.380
We are talking about a business with

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.240
a very high margin or a low margin.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.360
I am clearly not contributing

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.120
much.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.620
What I want to say is that the margins

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.600
must be seen in conjunction

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.780
with another set of factors.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280
For example, Your lottery has

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.920
a very small margin, right?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.060
We are talking about

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.820
a billionaire market.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.560
If you go to small-margin business

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.800
models, they have to be

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.580
more market scale volumes.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.140
On the contrary, if you make

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.320
a lot of money with each of the

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.260
customers you have, well, because

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.840
you can afford to make the market

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.680
smaller.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.200
The case of Hawkers is a case where

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.960
the margin is very high for each

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.060
of the glasses sold and also

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.400
its market is huge.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.520
It is a huge fortress.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.640
Well, as you have seen, we have

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.200
analyzed a business model from

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.660
different perspectives and I don't

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.000
pretend you've understood them all

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.580
because we've seen many, right?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.620
But as I told you, I'll leave you the

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.240
chest so that you work it and so that

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.840
if at some point you have to

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.780
analyze a business, you remember,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.780
go back and analyze it from these

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.520
perspectives because you'll get

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.900
it out and you'll get it and

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.780
you'll be more able to make better

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.940
decisions.
