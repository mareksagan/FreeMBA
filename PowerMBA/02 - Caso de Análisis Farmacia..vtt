00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.900
As I have commented on other

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.920
occasions, canvas is not a

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.720
tool that allows us to only

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.820
describe a business model,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.980
but it is also a very useful tool

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.460
that from that description

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.840
we can do analysis, we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.940
can get conclusions,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.300
since identify strengths,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.440
weaknesses, etc., and also try

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.740
to evolve that model, look

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.920
for some innovation in the

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.160
business model.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.100
Today we are with Carlos Frutos, whom

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.220
I have asked to help us by explaining

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.640
this process that I have just told

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.820
you from the description,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.580
analysis and evolution.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.500
I have asked him to help us because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680
he is an expert in this tool and for

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.600
many years what he has been is, well,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.760
a speaker and helps in talks

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.800
especially to business owners,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.260
small and medium-sized enterprises,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.800
to incorporate this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.640
methodology as one of their

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.300
strategic tools.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.960
And we will do it with a case,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260
we will analyze the case of a pharmacy,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.900
because for certain circumstances

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.460
it is also an expert in this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.540
business model.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.200
So, Carlos, what we can do

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.580
is, well, thank you so much

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.760
for being with us.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.220
Many thanks to all of you.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.880
If you like, let’s go ahead,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.600
you explain, we’re drawing the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.200
canvas together.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.860
Perfectly, because the principle is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.460
to clarify that we have chosen a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.840
pharmacy business model because

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.960
it is an easy model to analyze,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.120
I do not say that it is easy to manage,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120
but it is easy to analyze and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.500
very rich in terms of possibilities

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.840
of evolution and are at a time of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.760
transformation where it applies

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.900
very well this methodology

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.080
of analysis and evolution

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.220
of business models.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.920
The first convenient block to analyze

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.080
in every business model is that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.560
of customer segments, because

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.840
in the end of every analysis

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960
the first one must be the customer

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.600
we address.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240
In the case of this pharmacy,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.240
we are talking about a traditional

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.080
neighborhood pharmacy, we are

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.440
not looking at a tourist pharmacy

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.880
or other more advanced pharmacy

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.120
models, we find that the customer

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.140
segments that this pharmacy

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.520
has is only one and it is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.460
the neighbors that it has

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.460
around the pharmacy

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.780
office, private, close graphically.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.560
It may seem that there are

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.900
other segments such as women,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.700
as teenagers, third age, but the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.080
reality is that the pharmacy,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.040
this pharmacy we are analyzing,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.740
is directed indifferently

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.200
to all these segments and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.460
therefore we cannot talk about

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.800
different segments of customers

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.220
because there are no different

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.680
value proposals for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.560
them.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.860
Well, not a lot of people, it is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.360
not that almost everyone, when

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.440
you ask them to describe the customer

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.420
segments of their business,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.900
starts to detail thousands

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.500
of segments, ages, sex, geography,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.320
when in the bottom

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.180
everyone is giving them

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.140
coffee for everyone.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.420
Effectively, we have to that excessive

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.580
segmentation thinking that we have

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.940
special things for them and it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.340
is not true, in the case of a pharmacy

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.660
offers everything it has at the disposal

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.660
of customers, that to analyze

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.260
is the offer of products and services

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.420
that my pharmacy offers to the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.400
neighboring customer segment and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.080
here we have to do an analysis

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.280
of a certain high level, it

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.780
is not necessary a detail for

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.360
the effects of the model analysis.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.820


00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.360
We are talking about two

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.060
large, mainly medicines, whether

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.700
they are genetic brands, even master

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.240
formulation, if some pharmacies

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.880
have it, and on the other hand

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.320
for pharmacy, everything that is

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.420
not medicine, products for sale.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.700
That’s what a pharmacy sells today.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680
They have practically no services, services

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.260
that are very irrelevant, although they

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.760
are already gradually

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.040
incorporating them, too, that

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.120
depends on the legislation.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.310
The next block to analyze are the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.430
distribution channels, how my business

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.690
model reaches the customer segments

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.770
to offer them the products

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.930
and services, offer you,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.050
show you, give you after-sales,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.310
depends on the model we are

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.190
talking about.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.130
In the pharmacy, yes.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.110
Here we would find alternatives

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.330
such as an auto vending machine

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.470
if it were the case, some

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.310
pharmacies have it, or even a web

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.910
channel if we were analyzing

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.130
a pharmacy that sells online.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.330
There are very few or none.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.210
Yes, but I put as examples of alternative

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.510
channels so that you understand

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.510
well what kind of channels

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.450
can be in this block.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.150
From the point of view of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.290
customer relations, in the case of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.890
the pharmacy we are analyzing,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.370
it is a demonstrative relationship,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.930
a personal relationship of pharmaceutical

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.590
care.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.110
We’re not talking about it like it

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.790
could be in other business models of

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.150
commercials or a self-service

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.310
relationship, etc.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.270
Here we are basically talking about

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.190
pharmaceutical care based on demonstration.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.810
I would say, Carlos, that to explain

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.290
it a little more, I would

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.870
describe a little, it’s a close

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.050
relationship, isn’t it?

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.770
It is a close relationship based,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.910
as we will see later, on the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.150
trust between the pharmacist and his

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.810
team and the neighbors, which

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.170
we could basically call a personal

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.870
or demonstrative relationship.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.430
Yes, the demonstrator is okay, yes.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.850
The next block to analyze, which

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.690
I have liked because it usually

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.610
gives a lot of play, as we

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.910
will see later, is the flow

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.810
of income.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.030
This business model we are looking

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.490
at only has a revenue

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.630
flow and is the sale of products.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.470
There is no more.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.930
In some cases, I’m told, man, it’s not the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.890
same whether it’s with or without a prescription.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.470


00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570
No, the flow remains the same,

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.530
selling products, regardless

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.510
of whether one covers the bill

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.390
via credit card or via prescription

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.190
that will take time to pay the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.070
standalone meal by turn,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.590
for one, three or six months.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.230
The concept we enter

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.650
is selling products.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.650
Yes indeed.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.010
You sell a drug or sell a project

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.930
for the pharmacy and snakes by

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.510
the point.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.250
It is curious because I have perceived

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.890
it when you analyze with businessmen

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.830
of different business models

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.490
the flow When you ask them

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.010
that they can,, you ask other

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.430
alternatives, it seems to

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.430
them a thing like science fiction.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.130
I do this, I sell products,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.190
I do this.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.410
Because they have not raised

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.930
it, but it is the block in which

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.550
we can find the biggest innovation

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.190
today.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.970
We will see it a little later,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.530
when we analyze and evolve the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.370
model.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.410
We will see, yes.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.450
The next block we have to

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.310
analyze are the key resources.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.010
What resources does our pharmacy

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.150
need to operate?

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.470
There is an absolutely important

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.030
resource that is the owner of

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.070
the pharmacy, because without it,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.810
in current legislation, a pharmacy

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.290
cannot be started.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.170
And all the additional resources,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.930
such as human resources, the stock

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.190
of medicines and for pharmacy that

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.690
we have to sell.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.110
A resource that emerges relatively

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.830
recently in the pharmacy

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.930
sector is funding.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.470
Maybe years ago it wasn’t necessary.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.170
Today, due to problems

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.050
with late payments of the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.970
national health system, funding

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.570
has become a key resource

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.810
for running the pharmacy

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.790
business model.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.550
That is, you have to have

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.390
a local with the partner, you

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.450
have to have some employees,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.930
you have to have a stock

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.170
of medicines and the rest

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.190
of products and also you

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.810
have to have some capital to

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.830
finance, to finance the operations

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.930
for a while, so they tell

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.330
us, which now requires it.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.890
Or have the capital or have

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.190
the external financing capacity

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.390
for that delay in payment.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.530
The next block is the key

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.330
activities.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.430
In the pharmacy office we are evaluating

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.770
there are two major activities.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.430
No need to detail much more.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.130
The first has to do with all the management

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.430
of purchases, rotations, obsolescence,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.170
expirations.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.010
It is very important in this the stock

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.430
and rotations in order to

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.410
improve profitability and

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.370
to reduce costs.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.470
And a second important

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.070
global activity that is

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.450
all about pharmaceutical

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.730
care, sales, patient

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.230
and customer care.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.650
There can be other derivatives

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.150
such as the training of staff that

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.530
is very important but that first

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.090
is not done in a very intensive

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.970
way and we could be a larger

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.530
order than the others.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.050
Look I here would tell you Carlos

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.450
that I am seeing, I am thinking

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.690
of the resources that is key that

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.190
you have told us and the key activities

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.970
and I would tell you that they

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.590
are very common to all retail activity

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.130
because in the end if you think

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.790
it is a pharmacy or a point

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.030
of sale that sell other kind of

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.550
things always you need local,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.730
you need employees, you need

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.330
certain stock usually and the

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.690
key activities are to buy and

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.110
sell.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.090
In this case I think we can

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.550
bring the fact that this can be

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.670
true or this that is explaining

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.890
to us could be a pattern really

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.090
common to another type of

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.230
business models, mainly

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.710
retail.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.370
It shares with retail as you say

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.810
several things but there is a

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.410
certain specificity in a particular

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.730
pharmacy, the license as such that

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.550
is not produced in other retail and

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.370
all the part of the product

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.730
that it sells associated not only

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.030
with expirations that that could

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.930
be common in some other retail

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.830
but also to the type of product

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.390
financed by the health system.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:32.950


00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.310
Effectively that is different and

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.030
the key resource is the fact

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.850
that you have to be the owner

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.230
of a resource that is regulated

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.690
above because it has many implications

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.790
as far as entry barriers

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.550
etc. But well there are certain,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.950
we could say that the model

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.450
we are seeing shares or is

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.030
a retail pattern.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.750
Well we go ahead.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:56.990
The next I think would be the

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.250
ecosystem of alliances here

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.770
we have to include all the

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.810
alliances that allow us to give

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.130
a better service, expand our

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.150
offer, win in brand, etc.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.630
In the case of pharmacy we are talking

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.710
about suppliers as are the

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.010
laboratories and wholesalers, the

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.670
cooperatives that provide product

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.770
to our and a very interesting and

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.110
very important alliance is that

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.250
of the pharmacy school of the

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.330
community or the province in

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.930
which it is concerned because it

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.210
is what allows to group all the

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.550
pharmacies and improve their

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.310
conditions to manage the electronic

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.670
prescription etc.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.550
That is, in principle here Carlos

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.110
no longer focused on the pharmacies

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.690
but in general on the ecosystem

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.210
of alliances that is what we have

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.610
to think of all external relationships

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.570
that help in some way.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.190
Of course they help us now or they

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.910
could help us in the future, for

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.950
example prescribing our products,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.050
gaining brand, acquiring or outsourcing

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.190
resources instead of having

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.470
them incorporated, all of

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.270
which has to do with external

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.470
resources that help our

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.170
sales model.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.630
It is very good, and I think

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.990
the cost is clear.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.430
And finally the cost structure

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.550
is simple, generally the costs

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.390
are derived from the resources

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.850
that our business model has,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.130
although sometimes the costs

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.370
are also increased by

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.790
some type of activity, such

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.990
as a marketing activity or

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.750
some type of relationship

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.090
with customers, a relationship

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.130
through the web that would

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.490
impact the costs as such.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.310
And this is our business model

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.450
as you see it is a simple model

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.090
to analyze and in exchange as

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.930
we will see below Rich in terms

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.270
of its analysis and possibilities

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.870
to evolve.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.330
It is worth, as we have seen Carlos

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.250
has described the model, he also

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.050
knows it well, he has described

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.290
the business model of a pharmacy

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.290
that as we have seen also

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.750
shares certain patterns with

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.350
other models of retail, although

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.550
with some particularities

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.790
such as a regulated sector,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.310
which tells us about financing,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.950
etc.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.190
What we will do now from

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.430
now on is we will get conclusions,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.590
we will do an analysis,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.510
we will do it in the

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.170
next class.
