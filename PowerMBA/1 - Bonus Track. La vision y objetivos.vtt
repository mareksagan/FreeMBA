00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.070
Carlos, in the business world

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.750
we always work on the vision and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.690
mission, because I think we all

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.690
have very clear that any company

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.430
has to be clear, being redundant,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.670
where it wants to get, which

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.710
is the vision.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.510
However, on a personal level,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.090
people usually don't do it

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.990
and go forward, but to what

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.290
life brings.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.950
So, I would love you to

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.310
share with us the methodology

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.770
of the airport test

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.850
so that we can do that, to identify

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.610
each of our students who

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.570
do the reflection where

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.890
they want to get.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.530
And I think this analysis is very

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.610
beneficial because it will help

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.110
us, when you have clear where

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.610
you want to get, it is easier for

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.630
you to make decisions or do

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.710
what is necessary to get there,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.770
it is easier for you to face the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.670
obstacles you will find,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.950
it is much easier to make

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.850
the necessary efforts.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.470
It's like the old saying in

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.410
Alice in Wonderland, that if

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.670
you don't know where

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.050
you're going, it doesn't matter

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.370
what path you take.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.330
So, really, I've been concerned

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.050
about investigating what

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.490
tools can be applied in the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.650
day-to-day, that a normal person

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.250
like you and I can use

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.830
them to precisely define

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.210
that vision that helps

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.990
us know what we want to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.710
do in life.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.150
And I found an exercise called the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.650
airport test, which really originates

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.570
from a gentleman who lives

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.090
in San Diego, California, who

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.930
is called Pat Flynn, who has

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.330
written a book called Will It Fly,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.590
but now we're going to talk

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.350
about the book, let's talk

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.670
in particular about the exercise

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.930
of the airport test.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.330
And this airport test is really

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.550
a letter to the lower kings, that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.650
is, what do I want to be as

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.210
a major?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.630
Not so big, but what do

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.430
I want in five years?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.390
And the subject is that first of

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.970
all I have to define in what

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.090
areas I want to visualize that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.930
future that I want to when seeing.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.890
What I am going to propose is to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.570
travel five years in the future

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.530
and for example there are four

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.550
areas that are usually very important

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.690
for all people but each can choose

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.090
what they want, for example

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.990
family, as I want to see from

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.230
here to five years in everything

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.050
that has to do with family

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.810
topics, for example work

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
or business, professional field.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.610
There's another big block that could

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.690
be money, my finances, what do I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.130
want to do?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.810
That doesn't have to be

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.170
related to working with business

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.590
but let's say my relationship

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.930
with money, how do I want

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.530
to be financially?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.990
And then the fourth pillar

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.010
that people normally look at in

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.570
this test is health.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.430
It would be family, work, business, money

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.350
and health.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.490
But there are people who may

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.390
be interested in

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.470
spirituality or music or travel.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.930
Everyone can choose the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.810
areas they prefer.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.070
I prefer to focus on four because

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.530
so the exercise say we can

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.410
concentrate on these four

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.030
areas.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.590
Really the exercise consists in that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.990
on a sheet of paper to be possible

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930
in a handwritten way because what

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.350
we write by hand, that I already

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.410
see you are doing, in those four

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.310
areas we be able to describe

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.870
with the greatest level of detail

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.570
possible how we would like to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.130
be within five years.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.430
To really visualize this well,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.650
I will give an example.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.730
I will put the example that Pat

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190
Flynn himself writes in his book

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.350
because it seems very illustrative

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.770
and even though our life is different

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.690
from his it gives us a pattern

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.550
to be able to do this exercise.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270
I did it at home, of course.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190
I have made my wife do it too and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.310
then we did a joint exercise

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.550
because there were things we shared

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.670
in our vision that also help say to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.450
relate the relationship of a partner

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.090
and there are others that do not,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.090
which is good because they have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.050
generated up to some discussion.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.770
Of course, if they were, I'm thinking

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.510
in the case of a marriage, if they

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.130
were, if the plans are absolutely

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.450
different there's a problem.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.670
There is a problem, indeed, but

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.210
the sooner it flows out the better.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.490
We are not responsible

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.370
for the divorce of one of our

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.990
students.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.930
But to see, this exercise that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.970
can be done in pair for the family

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.450
topic, above all, can also

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.810
be shared with colleagues

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.290
or within a company with your

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.650
own boss to see if there

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.210
is really a shared vision

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.450
or with partners, partners,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.330
partners, working teams.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.710


00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.290
I think the exercise

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.990
is quite powerful.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.310
The first thing you need to do

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.770
is those areas, those areas in

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.110
which you want to do that vision,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.450
family, work, business,

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.650
money, health or any other.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.770
We fill the sheet and then we need to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.250
fill the sheet.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.190
So, I'll give an example of how

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.230
the sheet is filled.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.910
For example, Pat Flynn, in the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.770
family environment, says April,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.410
who is his wife, and I have

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.670
been married for 11 years

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.450
and we are still madly in love.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.570
That is in five years.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.970
Now they have six and in five years

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.710
they will have eleven.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.710
I go with April every day to

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.210
take and pick up the kids to school.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.470
That is, it's something he wants to

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.970
do inside, you see within five

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.450
years doing it.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.970
Children are happy,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.250
healthy and want to

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.730
learn on their own.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.370
I cooked and ceded in family

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.290
virtually every day of the week.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.650
He is designing his life.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.030
What life do you want in a family

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.190
in five years?

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.330
Every two months we go on vacation.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.570
They are shorter during

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.690
school and longer during summer.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.430
We are open and sincere with

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.010
each other in family, even

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.270
when we are angry.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.010
April and I trust our children

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.550
and that they make wise decisions

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.170
to a healthy and

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.990
happy life.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.190
I am 100% mentally present with

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.670
my family when I am with them.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.590
So that.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.410
And my kids are very interested

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.730
in entrepreneurship and learning

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.010
to launch their own exercises.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.710
I've made the subject familiar

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.210
with important things that's not

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.210
to copy what Padfling has done.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.130
Everyone has to know what we

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.910
want to and it depends on the

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.630
family moment.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.070
Inspire, help not to face a blank

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.170
sheet, as we always say, when you

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.430
read what others have put, because

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.710
you already know a little how

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.010
to describe it.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.890
He is writing, he is actually

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.050
writing his life in five

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.350
years.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.490
That is, that is.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.650
I will give you a professional

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.570
example, which I think illustrates

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.550
us a lot too.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.290
Look at the workplace, how it

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.370
looks in five years.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.370
I continue to earn income as

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.370
a lecturer, because I started

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.210
a career as a lecturer.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.730
Once a month I travel to different

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.230
parts of the world to talk to small

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.110
and large audiences about business

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.350
and entrepreneurship.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.810
I have written many books, including

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.510
a best seller, according to the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.350
New York Times.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.550
A goal is set.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.430
I am a consultant to a dozen companies

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.970
and organizations whose products

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.470
and services I have used fascinated

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.570
for a long time.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.370
I have founded a non-profit organization

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.170
that helps teach children the principles

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.010
of entrepreneurship, while

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.510
also strengthening the bonds

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.650
between children and their

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.330
parents.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.110
I absolutely love what I do in my

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.410
work, including the most challenging

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.590
and difficult parts.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.010
I organize a monthly meeting

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.430
in San Diego, where anyone

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.090
can join.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.490
We eat together, talk about entrepreneurship

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.930
and answer your questions.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.870
My schedule is very flexible.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.270
I can take a day off when I want

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.770
to or go on vacation when I want

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.770
with my family.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.510
Every time I check my email,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.870
I get dozens of thank

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.490
you messages from the people

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.050
I reached.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.910
I am still ethical in my business.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.570
This is the most important for me.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.490
I have not sold myself or moved to

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.830
the dark side.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.430
Find out what your vision is

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.510
for the next five years.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.230
Everyone can have,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.210
obviously he is an entrepreneur,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.290
has his own business, has

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.770
his activity as a lecturer

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.350
and has a mission he has

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.830
defined to help others to

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.830
undertake, etc.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.590
But he is defining this area.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.950
I don't know if you want to share

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.790
the other two, which is

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.270
equally interesting for us.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.690
Some kind of pin.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.850
Look at it, look at it.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.710
For example in money.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.530
In money says my family home

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.090
is fully paid and I have zero

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.150
debts.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.690
The goal of those five years.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.030
Per some have to see it further

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.750
away from time, but I have three

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.850
real estate properties

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.890
that produce me income

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.910
without I having to deal

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.730
with them.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.790
I have a fund to cover my

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.070
children's university studies.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.930
Every year I can contribute

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.550
significantly to a pension

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.410
savings fund.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.850
I make hundreds of thousands

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.470
of dollars a year to organizations

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.650
I choose to help.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.330
My wife and I never talked about

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:42.830
money.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.950
What a fun.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.730
Our children are not paid,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.430
they earn money doing their

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.590
duties and show good behavior.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.550
Our children understand that they

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.850
lose money by contributing to a bunch

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.450
of complaints every time they complain

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.970
about something before trying

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.730
to resolve it.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.830
That is good practice.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.550
We have a reserve fund that covers

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.430
all of our expenses for two

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.790
years and we spend the money

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.070
with head and never just because

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.190
we can do it.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.930
However, we do not have to pick

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.470
up the budget if we want to spend

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.370
on something, on some capricho

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.610
that we want to give.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.950
This is how he wants to look

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.110
in the future in terms

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.510
of money and finance.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.530
It seems to me, obviously, Pat Klimp's

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.910
life is not the life of the vast majority

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.990
of people, among other things, because

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.450
he has been able to put this

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.110
kind of methodology into practice.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.070
If you don't dream about it, you

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.310
may or may not, but if you don't

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.130
dream about it, you won't

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.950
ever get it.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.510
He is clear that he dreams about it

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.090
and also does everything possible to it.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.950
I think the recommendation

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.770
is that all students

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.950
already do the exercise.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.510
So is it.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.010
Identify the areas, family, work,

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.590
money, health and if there is any

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.910
other area that is important to them,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.010
I don't know, it's a sport you

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.570
practice, some hobby you have,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.890
etc., and describe in the greatest

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.870
detail possible how you want

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.970
your life from those perspectives

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.210
in five years.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.030
Because it will inspire them, it will

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.990
motivate them and surely things arise

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.430
in which we all realized we want

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.950
it to be so, but we are not doing

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.530
anything to make it happen.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.570
So is it.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.570
That is the first step.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.070
You are right because the way

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.630
to improve is, first, to know

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.110
what goal you want to

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.730
and then start taking steps

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.790
every day toward achieving

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.810
that goal.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.910
Unfortunately, we always

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.310
overestimate what we can

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.750
in the short term, in a week,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.010
in two weeks, in a month,

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.910
and underestimate what

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.850
we can in a year or five

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.410
years.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.210
And here we have the map to be able

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.430
to get it, that is, it is

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.370
a very good advice to have the

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.890
map clear and the steps we have

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.050
to take to get it.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.530
I would recommend that, in addition,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.630
this map, this photo finished, be

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.410
always present.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.630
As you said, you have to

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.690
take steps every day.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.270
every day.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.490
We need to be clear every

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.610
day where we want to go.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.210
The ideal thing is that you have it

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.730
even on your desk or in a place

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.710
where you can see it every day at

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.770
your office, if you have a

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.890
desk at home or at work and you have

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.390
it, have it present or on your

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.930
computer.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.950
Because you take a look at it every

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.350
day and don't forget that those

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.290
lagoons are what you want to

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.750
get at five years' sight.
