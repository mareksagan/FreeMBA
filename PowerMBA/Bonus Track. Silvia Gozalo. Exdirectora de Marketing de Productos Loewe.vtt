00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.640
Silvia, you've talked about values

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.500
and codes as determinants

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.040
of creating a brand, but I

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.460
don't know exactly what the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.080
difference between each is.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.040
It is important to know this

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.700
difference, because it is true

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.440
that many people do not have

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.200
it very clear.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.700
Values are really your DNA, which is

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.460
what makes you unique and special and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.660
is really different from the one in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.640
front of you.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.540
It is really what remains and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.000
the codes are what are

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
evolving over time.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060
If we put a practical example of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940
a person, the values would be what

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.980
you are, you know, or what

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.100
I am, you know, as a person,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.640
exactly what I am.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.820
The codes are how I have

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.180
evolved over time or I have

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.880
hair cut, I say the longer hair,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.800
a year or years ago I had it longer,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080
maybe then I had it, before

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.860
it was more classic dressing,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.380
now I am more modern or

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.720
the same as you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.260
You are the same person, you are the same person.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.880
It may even be the example of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.600
a person who, if he is single,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.840
married, has children, those

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.720
would be the codes, but the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.760
values are always the same.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.080
You are, exactly, you are as you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
are, with your ethics, with your

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.400
education, with your way of being,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060
etc., with your personality, because

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.180
it is your personality, it is your

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.780
DNA, it is what makes you not the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.160
one in front of you.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.500
And the codes are what have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.660
been, somehow, changing as it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.080
has been evolving over time.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440
In the case of the brands, it is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.300
exactly the same.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.620
We in our brand have a number of values,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.860
because obviously you talk

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.780
about culture, you talk about craftsmanship,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.800
you talk about excellence, you

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.320
talk about service, you talk

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.720
about, of course, Spain, because

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.960
it is the only Spanish luxury brand.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.200
There is no other.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.140
And that's what makes you different.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
And from those values, you have

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.200
to work on everything that is the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.340
marketing mix, the product, the communication.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.800
A little of what we talked about

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.220
before, you have to work on the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.880
basis that nothing of what you do

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.540
can, somehow, say, uy, this is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.260
not my brand.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780
It is true that it is noticed.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.280
Suddenly, if you think of an idea

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.280
and say, this is not within the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.620
values.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.440
Yes, this is not my brand, it is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.320
not aligned with values.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.580
And the codes are that interpretation

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.520
or that evolution that does not

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.880
change.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.960
Of course, it will evolve according

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.640
to the weather, the tastes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.780
of customers, etc., countries,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.380
too.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.980
Of course, of the countries, but basically

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.600
it is not so much of the countries,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.840
but it is the brand itself

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.060
that is evolving.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.620
For example, a little what I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.300
told you before, what I saw before,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.100
the bags were brown, with the black

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.600
logo, one of a certain typology,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.380
and now that bag or that branding

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.580
has changed and is white with

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.620
the black logo and a totally different

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.860
typography, even what are

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.800
the communication

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.880
layouts, etc.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.400
That is what is evolving

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.920
with time.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.540
The codes are touchable, what is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.260
untouchable you can never

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.000
change and has to be there, are

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.280
the values, the DNA of the brand.
