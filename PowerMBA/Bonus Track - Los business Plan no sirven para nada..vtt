00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Business plans are useless.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Not only that, but usually what they do is that they lead you to make a mistake.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm going to tell you what usually happens when a company is born.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
It usually starts with an idea, a vision, an opportunity that you have identified.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
And what you do is, from that idea, you build a business plan.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And also, the more training you have and the more professional experience you have,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
your business plan will be more complete.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
And you will have taken into account absolutely everything.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
It will be a five-year plan in which you have projected everything that is going to happen.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
How will the clients react?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
How much will they pay for your product?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
What will be the retention rate of clients?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
What profitability or what customer life value are you going to get from each client?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
What are the distribution channels that you are going to use?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Etc.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
And you will have everything absolutely projected in your business plan.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
And from that business plan, which you believe in,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
what you do is execute it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Then the work begins.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
What you do is, well, usually you leave your job,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
you leave the job you had, you invest your money,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
you associate with people who provide you what you don't have,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
you invest in creating that product.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
This usually takes a long time and a lot of money.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, maybe you've been creating a product for a year that's perfect.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You invest in marketing, in public relations,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
you hire a sales team or maybe you do it.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Everything always with the launch date in mind.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And that day comes, a day comes when after a year and a half,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
after having spent all the money,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
after having fulfilled your business plan exactly as you had planned,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
you go to the market.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
And what happens almost always?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
That the business plan does not support the first contact with the clients,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
that nothing happens of what you had planned.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Which is a real drama.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Because a lot of time has passed, you have invested too much money,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
you have little margin, etc.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And you don't know why it doesn't happen.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You don't know why what you have planned doesn't happen.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You don't know.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I don't buy the clients, but you don't know why.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
That's why I told you that business plans are not only useless,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
but many times they are also absolutely counterproductive.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
And I'm going to explain to you the reason is that that business plan you have created,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
that document or that PowerPoint in which you have invested hundreds of hours,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
is based on many hypotheses,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
on many assumptions that you have made,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
which are really acts of faith.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
What am I referring to?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, to what I was telling you before,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
that you have assumed how the clients are going to respond.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
That first you have assumed that the clients want to buy that product that you are creating.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
When, as we saw, one of the main causes of the start-ups dying,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
is that they build something or make something that nobody wants to buy.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You have given, of course, what the client's profitability is going to be.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
You have given, of course, the size of the market.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
How the distribution channels are going to work.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
If you invest in Facebook, what the return is going to be, etc.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
You have given, of course, many things.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
And you have committed all the viability of your business, of your project, to those hypotheses.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And what you have done has been to execute that business plan that you made.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You have executed it perfectly, you have done it perfect.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
You have been very productive in the cost, in the time that exactly your PowerPoint said.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
What happens is that, as always happens,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
and I told you, the business plan does not support contact with the clients.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Therefore, what we have to do, and it is what we are going to learn,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
is not to execute a plan that we have set up from our office.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
No, what we have to do is to put in motion a methodology

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
that allows us to quickly find a business model that is profitable,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
from our vision.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
But we have to quickly look for that profitable model

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
and as soon as we are able to realize that those hypotheses

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
about which we are building our plan or our strategy are wrong,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
the sooner we do it and the less money we have invested in doing it,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
much better, because we will have room for maneuver,

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
to iterate, to pivot, to change until we find it.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
This is the key for which many startups fail,

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
and this is the key for which we need a method that allows us to respond to this challenge.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Find a business model that is profitable and sustainable,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
investing as little time as possible.
