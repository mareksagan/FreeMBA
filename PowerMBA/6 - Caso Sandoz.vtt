WEBVTT

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.280
I will share with you the main

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.620
conclusions of a strategic

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.720
consultancy project

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.760
that we led Rafa, Gozalo and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.200
I a few years ago.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.300
Why is it?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.360
Because I think it will help

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.900
you understand well what are the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.280
benefits of making a more

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.440
customer-centric segmentation and

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.780
using the customer person.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.300
This project was developed for Sandod,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.240
which is a pharmaceutical

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240
laboratory and I will briefly

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.300
explain its business model.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.620
Sandod sells its distribution

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.900
channel, which is the pharmacies,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.300
and sells generic medicines to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
the pharmacies mainly.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
So, Sandod what you have to do

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.300
is manage or push the business

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.800
through its channel, which are

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.520
the pharmacies.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.220
And how does it?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.660
It does so through the commercial

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.640
department, which is the commercial

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.080
delegates spread across

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.820
the geography and each delegate

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.160
has a route assigned

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.400
to pharmacies.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.440
And they also have the support

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.380
of the marketing department that

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.600
what it does is to create and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.240
offer services to the pharmacies,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.340
which are services that help

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980
commercials to sell basically,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.840
and are services of all kinds,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.420
since from a trip to material for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140
the pharmacy to training

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.420
programs of any type.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.760
In addition, the objectives

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.680
set by each delegate are

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380
to increase their sales volume

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.160
in their pharmacy route compared

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.520
to the previous year in a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.780
percentage.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.380
very simple.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.500
But we'll look at the segmentation

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.640
strategy, because that's what

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.520
we're learning these

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.080
days.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.040
How did Sandod segment?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.420
And I'll share the table with the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780
same variables we've learned.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.240
Well, since geographic segmentation

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.860
here is important because from

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.140
that segmentation

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.720
you define the routes.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.460
And here there were important variables

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
like whether they are near or far from

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.140
a medical center, etc.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.780
But that is not the important thing now.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.860
Demographic variables are important

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.460
also because the demographic

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.940
variables in this case are,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.760
for example, the square meters

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.200
of the pharmacy, the number

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.980
of employees, the volume of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.160
invoice, etc.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.060
All these variables are put into

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.260
a bag, in a filter and allow you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.220
to set the routes to the trading.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.120
This information, of course, comes out

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.220
or comes out of IMS, which is

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.340
a consultant that has the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.480
information of the entire sector.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.160
And Sandod, like almost all

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.740
companies of this type,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.220
uses mainly behavioral

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.960
segmentation that is

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.100
ABC segmentation.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
What Sandod does is permanently

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.420
measure how much each of the pharmacies

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940
generates and segment and assigns

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.020
more resources or priorities to

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.280
the pharmacies to which it sells

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.160
more, which more business

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.700
is generating.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.960
Now, let's make a diagnosis

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.040
of what we've seen so

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.800
far.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.500
What are the problems or areas

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.740
of improvement?

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.300
I would say two.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.500
One, Sandod is conditioned

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.180
by what he is doing so far.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.040
That is, we've seen that you're

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.680
using ABC segmentation, which

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.480
is what Sandod is selling to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.860
these pharmacies, but you're forgetting,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.680
you're losing a lot of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.880
things, you're forgetting about

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.360
the customer, you're forgetting

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.600
how you could grow inside

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.800
each of the customers.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.720
And two, this segmentation,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.500
which is very related to the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.100
above, does not allow you to understand

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.460
well the challenges, the motivations

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.960
of each of the customers.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.240


00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.160
In the end, what is happening is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.120
that many opportunities are being missed.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480
It is fixed on what it does, how much

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.620
it sells to a customer, but is

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.180
not able to understand it well

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.760
and to think how it could improve

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.220
it otherwise, it is a very

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.320
product-centric posture.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.620
That is, it's a posture where they'

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.980
re thinking about what they sell

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.120
to the customer, but they're not

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560
thinking about how the customer

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.740
is and what that customer

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.320
needs, right?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.580
well well.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.740
Now, let's go to the detail of the project.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.180
Let us start with the goal.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.460
What was the goal?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.500
Sell more of it.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.600
It cannot be more strategic.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.860
What was the main step

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.220
we had to take to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.400
this goal?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.140
Understand and know our customers

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.120
better, the pharmacies,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.640
with the aim of generating relationships

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.920
with greater linkage with

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.540
them and to be able to really

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.000
adapt to the knowledge

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.720
of those customers.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.980
Well, here the main premise

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.860
or the real key is that, unlike

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.340
what they were doing

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.580
in that pharmacies were

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.500
treated as pure statistics,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.200
we did what we did

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.940
is customize that.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.740
We realized that behind the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.900
pharmacies, behind the Excel

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.840
and behind the statistics,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.240
there are people, there are

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.400
pharmacists, there are businessmen

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.080
who have, each of them

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.300
has challenges,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.140
motivations, different needs.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.660
And if we can understand that,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.760
if we truly reach the minds

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.400
and hearts of our customers

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.640
and adapt Sandoz's proposals

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.980
to each of those pharmaceuticals,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.880
we will get Sandoz to

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.800
sell a lot more.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.300
Go to the detail.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.460
Back to segmentation.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.020
Remember that Sandoz was

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.040
using geographic, demographic

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.500
and behavioral variables.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.900
We have built a richer

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.400
segmentation, more

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.320
person-based.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.320
We incorporate or identify that

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.660
there are a number of different

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.360
profiles within pharmaceuticals.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.140
Profiles based on attitudes, that

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.240
they are more innovative, more

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.300
conservative, etc.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.080
Basically what we did is a one

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.960
to five star segmentation

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.420
with the different pharmaceutical

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.760
profiles.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.340
At one end, younger pharmacists,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.980
with more desire to improve, with

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.440
more open minds, etc.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.080
And in the other extreme the opposite.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.100
I think you can get the idea.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.420
And the key here is that we incorporate

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.640
segmentation into function,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.980
this is the true key, we incorporate

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.860
segmentation according to

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.840
the problems, challenges

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.600
and motivations of

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.440
those pharmaceuticals.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.280
That by the way is very

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.580
related to profiles, because

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.860
each of the profiles we saw

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.180
has a number of similar challenges,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.680
I say.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.410
I will summarize it.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.230
The 4 and 5 star pharmacies, for

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.330
example, which are the pharmacies

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.210
with a more innovative profile,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.050
what they were demanding from us

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.930
is services aimed at helping them

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.350
grow as entrepreneurs, help

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.110
them better manage their pharmacy,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.350
help them innovate, etc.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.490
Instead, the pharmacies with less potential,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.970
those profiles of less innovative

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.270
pharmaceuticals, what they are

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.950
looking for is other things.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
What they are looking for is that

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.490
you don't tell them stories, that you talk

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.530
about discounts, etc.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.710
From all this information,

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.910
we created the customer

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.890
person.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.890
We created the customer person

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.670
of the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 star pharmacies

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.450
and described them in detail,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.810
how they are, what they want,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.410
how they relate to the delegate,

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.230
etc.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.330
Well, from all this, what we

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.340
did is adapt the entire marketing

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.740
and marketing strategy.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.060
And I will briefly tell you how

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.500
we adapt the marketing and

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.920
marketing strategy to those

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.360
4 and 5 star pharmacies.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.500
Well, we prioritized the routes

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.560
of delegates, what we did was prioritize

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560
those pharmacies at the expense

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.420
of eliminating the pharmacies

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.420
with less potential, which came

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.320
out of the routes.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.680
We trained delegates so that the

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.140
commercial approach, so that the

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.280
relationship with those 4 and 5

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.460
star pharmacists, which you

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.220
remember have a certain profile,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.600
rather than being a product-based,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.740
price-based conversation,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.620
were a different conversation.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.040
They were a more business conversation,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.960
focused on increasing the link.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.960
We can and want to help you.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.360
In addition, they adapted, remember

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.620
that I told you at the beginning,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.120
that the marketing department

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.940
supports delegates with a number

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.520
of services.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.420
Well, because the marketing

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.080
services offered or offered

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.100
to those pharmacies have evolved.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.080
And instead of offering them travel

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.220
or discounts, what we talked about

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.220
was services aimed at helping

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.500
you improve your business.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.540
By the way, what we created is a presencial

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.160
MBA in a series of journeys that

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.880
we offered to the pharmacies with

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.100
the highest potential of 4 and 5 stars,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.820
because they were people with

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.940
desires to improve.
