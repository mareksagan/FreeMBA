00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.510
Understanding how business

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.470
valuation works, at least

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.790
having certain notions, is absolutely

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.410
necessary for anyone who is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.730
related to business or management

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.210
and administration

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.130
of companies.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.670
Why is it?

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.510
Well, very obviously, it is that

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.410
the value of a company, it does not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.330
matter to me if we talk about a pharmacy,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.410
that of a company listed or of a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.810
non-listed company that bills

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.090
500 million, it does not matter

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.530
to me, is one of the most important

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.190
indicators and also increase

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.430
the valuation should be

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.530
one of the key objectives of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.770
managers, owners, etc.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.870
What happens is that many people

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.030
forget this perspective, it is curious.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.570
When making an investment, people

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.890
usually take into account the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.950
value of the asset,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.570
revaluation, etc.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.570
However, with companies it is very

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.670
common to be unaware of it and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.970
in fact I am convinced that if

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.690
we did a survey among SMEs

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.470
owners, an elevated percentage

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.790
would not have any idea of what

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.390
the value of their company is.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.450
Look, what I'm going to do is, we'

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.330
ll list a series of situations

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.930
in which the valuation of companies

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.330
is used, which, as you'll

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.950
see, are very different situations.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.100
The first and most

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.220
common is the purchase.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.280
But, and here as I said to you, it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.400
doesn't matter whether we are talking

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.200
about a very small business, a family

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.880
business or a giant company,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.060
it doesn't matter.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960
At the time of a purchase-sale,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.520
the valuation comes into play.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240
Or, for example, if we make

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.440
capital expansions, if we

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.840
want investors to enter or we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.100
want partners to enter, or not

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.660
to enter, but to leave.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.760
It is very typical this,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.260
because imagine, in a SME two partners

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.300
argue or one retires, want to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.600
reach an agreement, etc.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.820
So how do they do it?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.940
How will I pay you?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720
Here the assessment comes into play.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.960
Also in inheritances, divorces,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.560
etc., sometimes you have to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.000
value the companies, as well

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.180
as the old ones.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.040
Also if we go to another level, well,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.420
because the investment funds,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.840
the Private Equity funds that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.180
invest in non-cotized, the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.840
Venture Capital funds that invest

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.880
in Startups, all these funds,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.940
what they do is when they will

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.020
enter a new company, what

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.200
they do is the valuation, they

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.740
have a series of analysts

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.820
that value the company.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.860
They are buying a share of that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.560
company.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.740
A lot thanks!
