00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.760
Today we will talk about a concept

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.920
that is very fashionable but

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.120
that we really love and is the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.280
business culture.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.660
By the way, it may sound

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.400
too theoretical, this has no

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.740
transcendence and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.300
other things, right?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.480
But I guarantee you that it is not so.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.700
It is proven that companies

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300
that have a rooted, powerful,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.200
very clear culture have

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.480
better results.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.180
They are 20 to 30

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.300
percent better than

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
their competitors.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.200
And why?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.900
Because culture contributes mainly

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.780
to two factors, in two leverages.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.540


00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.080
On the one hand, culture contributes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.300
to the value of the brand, helps you

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.000
create a brand.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.400
What is the brand for us?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.880
Well, because the brand serves

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.500
us to sell more, to connect better

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.800
with our customers, etc.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.720
You already know that.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.340
And on the other hand, culture

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.120
helps you to be able to attract

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840
and retain better talent, with

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.540
the huge impact that this has

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.480
on any organization.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.540
Now, we need to define

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.860
the concept of culture.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.400


00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.300
I will tell you that this is a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.000
very broad concept, which depends

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.940
on many things.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.240
And, moreover, if we look

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.860
for definitions, we will find a

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.960
million different definitions.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.860
Well, before we make our definition

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.260
of culture, what I'm going to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.300
do is ask you to do a little

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.000
exercise.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060
I want you to move for a second

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.920
to the companies I'm talking

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.420
about.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.420
You try to live the culture,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.380
what is lived there.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.800
We will start with Zapos, which

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.880
is the typical example of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280
exceptional culture, based on a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.880
huge autonomy, freedom, flexibility

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.800
of employees who have

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.760
managed to move into a unique

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.240
customer experience.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.000
His philosophy, his values is, if

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.220
I have happy employees, I will

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.560
have happy customers.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.880
Imagine what's going on in the office,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.980
in the office.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.040
Now let's move to Goldman

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.380
Sachs, which is an investment bank.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.260
I don't know if you know it or not, but

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.300
since you enter the scholars already

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760
earn a lot of money, the bonuses

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.200
every year are very high, everyone

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.380
working and thinking about the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.940
bonus.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.920
Very competitive environment, very well-

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.020
trained people, etc.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.000
People work until the twelve

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.160
in the evening, until the one

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.320
in the morning every day.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.700
This is Goldman Sachs.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.680
This is the culture of an investment bank.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.920
Now we will try to live the culture

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.480
of a neighborhood management.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.840
A lot of paper, lots of paper

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.920
everywhere.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.840
Employees have worked there

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.260
all their lives.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.520
The work is very repetitive.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.760
You don't do the same thing every

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.320
day, but throughout the year you've

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.380
been doing the same thing every

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.640
year for 25 years.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.220
More or less strict times.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.000
People do not work with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.960
excessive joy, etc.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.500
This is the usual culture.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.000
Not everyone has to be like that.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.320
I don't want to get into where they

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.100
don't call me, but it's the usual

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.860
culture in a neighborhood management.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.260
And let us now think of the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.820
culture of a factory, of a chain

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.760
of assembly.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.820
I don't have to describe it

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.900
much, but I understand that it's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.300
easy to imagine.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.320
You get there 5 minutes late and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.680
you get fired.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.260
Well, culture is what makes

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.680
these companies so different

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.760
from each other.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.160
Now let's try to make a definition.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.960
I like to define business culture

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.840
as the DNA or as the personality

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.960
of a company.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.880
And what does this depend on?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.900
Well, it depends on those characteristics

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.100
that this company has that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.860
makes it unique, because they

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.740
are unique in that company

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.700
as in a person.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.000
And that also distinguish you from the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.460
rest of the organizations.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.340
That is culture.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.300
The question is, what does culture

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.100
depend on?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.720
Because it's such a broad concept, I'm

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.760
talking about DNA, I'm talking about personality.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.100
What are the factors that determine

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.240
a company to have a culture

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.720
like zapos?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.760
People are happy, flexible, etc.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.380
or completely different cultures.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.440
Let us identify the key factors.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.940
The first is vision and mission.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.520
The mission, remember, is the reason

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.860
to be.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.820
What are we dedicated to?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.740
Because it's not the same as

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.720
your mission is to change the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.940
world, revolutionize a sector, create

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.560
a drug that will cure cancer.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200
It's not the same as that's your mission

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.440
to make your mission something much

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.200
more normal.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.700
Or the vision where do we want to go?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.880
What is the objective?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.480
This is crucial in the culture of

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.800
an organization.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.740
The Values.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.200
The values are very important,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.640
but they are not the values you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.120
have put on the about us of the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.780
website, on the top of us.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.400
It's not the values you've

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.600
written, it's the values you

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.780
live with every day.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.160
A very important and decisive factor

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.840
in an organization's culture is the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.080
people who make up the organization.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.480
And what does this depend on?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.540
It depends on the criteria of hiring,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.600
it depends on who you have

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.840
hired, it is obvious.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.920
In many cases, there are very homogeneous

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.880
cultures, very rooted in small

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.140
or medium-sized companies because

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.120
founders have surrounded themselves

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.520
with people who are very similar

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.320
to them.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.780
For example, I know small consultants

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.620
whom the founders, the general

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.020
directors, ultimately have selected

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.000
people who look like, then

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.680
ultimately the culture

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.800
is very homogeneous.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.780
Everyone has a similar profile.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.940
Culture depends on what you offer

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.140
your employees, how you treat

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.840
your employees, how you remunerate

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.880
them, whether they feel well

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.340
paid or not, but not just

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.640
economically, but in terms

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.780
of development, etc.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.060
An important factor, and we have

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.140
named it before when we talked

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.860
about zapos, is the autonomy,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.220
freedom, flexibility

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.380
that the people of your team

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.780
have.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.860
It has nothing to do with the culture

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.180
that is generated in a company where

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.940
you have a lot of autonomy, zapos,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.560
to the culture that is generated in

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.360
a company where you have nothing

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.220
to say.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.580
That has a huge impact.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.940
Another important factor is the close

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.080
relationship between the leaders

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.800
and the rest of the team.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.160
From companies that are very

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.520
horizontal, where everyone is very

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.280
close, to companies or cultures

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.400
that are very hierarchical,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.240
where it is almost impossible

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760
to access, communication flows

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.120
and is much worse.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.240
Another aspect is the place, are the offices.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.380
And I'm not just talking about whether

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.680
the offices are beautiful or

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.240
not, that's impact.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.580
I can share with you that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.780
we were two weeks ago at Typhoon

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.680
in Barcelona and the offices

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.640
are spectacular.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.460
Without scratching much more, the culture

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.620
that is perceived there is very marked.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.660
But not just the offices, that

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.520
is, not just the decoration, but

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.620
how far it is.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.880
Because I'm going to put you at an extreme,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.040
it's not the same that you have your

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.580
offices in Silicon Valley as you

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.780
have them in Iraq.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.740
That is, there are sites that

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.900
contribute in one way or another to

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.280
the culture of an organization.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.880
The last factor I will name

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.000
is risk tolerance, risk

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.320
aversion or not.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.460
There are organizations that have a culture

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.840
where it is understood that risking

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.040
and failing is understandable,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.360
nothing happens, they can even

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.480
encourage you to do so.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.980
And there are other organizations

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.120
in which all the opposite, which

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.660
sure come a lot to your head.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.900
This has a huge impact on

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.600
the culture of an organization.
