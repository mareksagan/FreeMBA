00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.870
Bernardo, what were the keys

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530
by which you achieved that idealist,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.010
that when he was born, so you

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.130
told us, it was an ultra competitive

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.750
market, with hundreds of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.890
portals at that time, and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.570
you spent a few years of that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.550
situation to be the leaders in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.230
a market in which I now think

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.430
you have a very high market

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.450
share and having created huge

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.890
barriers to entry and having

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.690
created a potent business?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.830
Well, these things seem very fast,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.150
but the idealist is 18 years old.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.870
If I were a baby, I would be going

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.550
to college.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.430
These things do not happen quickly.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.650
It was necessary to build equipment,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.530
create operations, sell, collect, and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.770
go through the biggest real estate crisis

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.890
in Spain’s history.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.010
I think it sounds easy, but I think

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.590
it’s the cluster of a lot of things,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.490
especially the perseverance

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.510
of those who have been there

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.350
in the day to day.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.810
I think it’s one of the fundamental

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710
aspects in the projects, but

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.330
I would point out four or five

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.830
things.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.690
One is that we chose a big and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.890
important problem to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.850
solve that affects many people.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.270
Everyone is looking for

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.370
a home at some point or another

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.670
and makes rental or purchase.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.030


00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.530
That is undeniable, but the rest,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.210
your competitors, were seeking

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.330
to solve the same problem.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.610
Here comes the rest of the variables.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.550
I think it’s important to get

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.950
a successful project, identify

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.050
these things.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.830
Then have a competitive technical advantage,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.010
that is, that you do something different

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.850
and better than the rest of the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.530
competition.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.350
In this case, it is the quality of

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.010
information.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.330
We made a lot of effort to make

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.530
the ads true and correspond

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.930
to a single property.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.110
This gave us a very important

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.470
quality feeling that distinguished

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.550
us from the competition.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.810
How do you control it?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.010
Because on a platform or in

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.010
a marketplace where the content

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.310
is raised by housing offerers.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410
How do you do to heal that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.310
content?

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.730
In the idealist case, the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.270
ads, the problems that there were

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.690
is that as the exclusive

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.390
transaction was less than 1%

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.590
in Spain, it was very common to

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.270
find many ads for the same property.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.550
For it was sold by the portier,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.290
four agencies, the private, the mother-

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.870
in-law who devoted himself to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.590
it in free time.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.230
Then there were 5 or 6 ads for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.930
the same property, 5 or 6 prices,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.790
5 or 6 photos, 5 or 6 sets of features.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.110
We wanted to structure that information

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.310
very well, clean the photos, make

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.390
them visually more aesthetic and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.310
establish a rule that was very important

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.210
for us, which was the unity

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.470
between the ad and the property,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.950
so that there was only one

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.830
ad per property in idealist,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.370
so that it did not spot

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.730
the search engine and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.570
cleaned the dynamics of the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.910
search engine a little.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.590
The expression was one of many...

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.450
Did you tell us two?

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.550
Not, but elements within the second,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.810
differentiating elements.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.450
Idealist was the quality of the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.510
information, the user experience,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.990
we were a reporter, we established

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.910
a fixed and defined criterion

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.370
of what were the neighborhoods,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.850
of the zones, because the good

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.230
zones tend to be very large

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.290
and the bad very small.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.630
Then we tried to have very defined

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.510
criteria for the allocation

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.470
of zones, map search when

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.570
making selections, the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.190
system of alerts, alerts.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.670
There were a lot of things that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.770
worked very well and that represented

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.150
an important differential element

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.130
with respect to competition

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.650
and that after many years

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.930
I think they have achieved

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.870
what idealists today.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.490
I would say, above all, the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.710
perseverance and commitment of

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.490
a long time.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.630
These technical competitive advantages

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.190
are initially true that they can

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.030
generate some attraction for you,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.770
but then they are comfortably

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.110
made because anyone can copy

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.870
it for you.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.530
We have studied Power MBA and we

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.730
have analyzed very deeply

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.110
the network effect or network economies

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.910
seeing as the first companies in

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.730
an environment, in a market

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.170
like the one we talked about,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.710
300 platforms, 300 marketplaces

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.750
in the real estate sector,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.210
real estate portals

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.610
competing.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.370
The first ones that gain attraction,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.550
the value is multiplied due to the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.410
network effect and makes it generate

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.890
huge entry barriers with respect

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.290
to the rest because the small

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.530
can no longer provide the same value

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.370
because they can not add neither

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.650
the same offer nor the same

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.990
return, they are left out of

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.750
play.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.590
How do these entrance barriers affect

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.450
in this case in the idealist case?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.970
I believe that in the idealist case

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.590
there are dynamics of what are called

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.710
network externalities that play

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.030
in their favor.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.110
As more ads are placed, more

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.830
attractive and as more attractive

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.350
more ads are placed.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.170
It is a virtuous circle in this

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.950
case that they usually have

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.070
these companies declasified or

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.510
all that needs viral content

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.070
that users create.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.170
Then in idealist we had that luck

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.150
of generating that virtuous

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.550
wheel and that creates a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.810
very strong entry barriers because

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.910
for it to have Google, it

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.930
has Facebook, it has 20.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.050
The more people there are, the more attractive

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.270
you are and the more attractive you are, the

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.010
more people come to you.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.370
So we continue to grow and it’s very

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.310
difficult for one who is

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.270
starting to be able to compete with

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.850
you unless you have a very

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.410
strong competitive advantage that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.210
people are worth making that transaction

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.790
cost of switching network where

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.410
you sacrifice network externality

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.110
for an added value that

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.230
the new technology may give

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.890
you whatever it is.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.810
We’ve seen how people have moved

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.670
from Friendster to Facebook, from

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.510
Friendster to MySpace, from

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.410
MySpace to Facebook and have been

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.870
sacrificing that network externality

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.430
because the new technology gave

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.650
them enough value to sacrifice

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.490
the previous value.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.330
Did you move from MySpace to Facebook

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.850
at a time when you had not yet

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.030
reached that critical mass

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.470
you have now?

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.030
MySpace had it, and Twente

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.030
had it.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.490
In the case of Twente, that is very clear.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.050
He lost her on Facebook.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.990
If there are any user transfers.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.730
But from Twente to Facebook it wasn’

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.890
t for a technical issue, it was for

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.130
a pure networking issue because I thought,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.250
you had friends in other sites around

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.650
the world, the network was bigger

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.070
and the network in that case what made

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.130
Facebook outperform Twente was

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.250
not a technical issue, sure there

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.970
was, but basically it was

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.290
that, it was that networking

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.450
economy in particular.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.750
I think it was a combination.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.670
Facebook began to offer services

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.670
that Twente cost to give and Telefónica

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.930
changed the focus from leaving to be a social

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.690
network to being a virtual mobile

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.750
operator and then there they promoted

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.310
themselves.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.030
I think you are right, it may not be

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.730
just a technical advantage and a network

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.270
with a much higher value, it is

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.770
a more international value network.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.830
In the case of Twente we had 90%

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.730
of the market share of the guys,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.070
there was no net larger than

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.270
Twente in that demography and

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.570
they liked being where the older

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.130
brothers and parents were not.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.870
I think it was a combination of

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.050
things, but the technical part

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.190
had the mobile app that worked

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.550
very well, the guys were increasingly

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.110
on mobile.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.510
I think it was a combination that

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.230
stopped investing technically

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.090
in Twente and eventually made

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.150
the Facebook offer more complete,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.590
by network size but also by

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.850
many technical functionalities,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.610
only in that transition to

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.530
the mobile that was occurring

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.310
at that time.
