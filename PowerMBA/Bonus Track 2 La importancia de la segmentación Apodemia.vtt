00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.200
What about Uncle?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.960
Many thanks.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.060
Nothing, thanks to you.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.820
First I would love that you explain

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.960
to the Power MBAs, that you tell us

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.320
a little about why we are here,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.200
how you started, what you studied,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.820
a little about your own and the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.120
company's history.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.240
I am here thanks to you and above

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.640
all thanks to Podemia, who has

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040
been the real opportunity I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.800
have had in my life after so

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.180
many opportunities.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.420
I started in Investment Banking,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.300
which was what I call the Mili,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.500
the Mili because you really shape

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.260
around finance, the economy, how

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.540
you run a company.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.200
And then Jimena appeared in my life

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.980
and suddenly her father, who is a sculptor,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.020
teaches her to make jewelry and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.940
starts selling jewelry to his friends.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.280
You can start with a hobby,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.000
as many have started, right?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.480
And suddenly he goes out of his hands

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.020
and I was in the banking making comparison

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.140
of companies says to me, hear Jaime,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.720
is that I don't know very well

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.240
how to go.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.060
We then did an analysis of the sector.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.780
We saw that the sector in Spain

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.120
was going pretty badly, but that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.620
at the global level it grew to very

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.640
high figures, around 40%, and that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.260
there was a possibility of starting

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.300
to introduce our product

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.140
to the market.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.880
This is 2012.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.340
And well, after this analysis and the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.980
entrepreneurial spirit that is necessary

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.160
to be able to start a company,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.460
he decided to leave the company

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.400
in which he worked.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.560
The hills alone.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.380
Well look, it's that the Investment

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.340
Banking is very tough, but then it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.800
very good because you learn a lot.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.180
It's a day of 16 hours, of 20 hours,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.100
some nights without sleep, right?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.720
I think it prepares you more.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.800
The mili you said, which I

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.880
like the term, prepares you more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.960
to learn to work.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.400
That is, to learn to work more

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.660
than the knowledge you will

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.680
apply then you in...

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.540
Because it is such a different world.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.280
Buying and making companies.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.520
I always tell people that it's true

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.580
I've learned a lot about finance,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.000
but that's what you can learn

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.160
in the Power MBA, but what I really

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.560
learned is yes, that's why.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.480
Compliance with deadlines.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.380
That's the hardest thing to learn

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.280
in a work environment where you're

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.960
not being pressed.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.920
And in addition, to make it clear to the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.960
Power MBAs, there is no environment

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.560
of more pressure than the one we are

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.120
talking about.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.900
Basically, she is super competitive,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.580
ambitious, very trained, working from

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520
sun to sun, with some wild bonuses.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.040
There is no environment with

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.800
more pressure.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.360
Well, I do not know one.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.640
Strategic consultation could

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.960
be there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.380
I would consult.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.860
And right around Mercantil too,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.920
which is the ones that take us the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.560
mergers, the mergers of our

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.220
sector, but everything that is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.000
within investment banking

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.740
is an environment of much pressure.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.160
So, are you founding the company?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.100
We founded the company...

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.700
No, well, I decided to leave

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.660
the job and then we do a study

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.820
of where we want to go, how

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.880
we want to go and where

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.600
we want to get.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.620
After leaving it.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.120
Then, well, we did it before

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.500
and then how we would call

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000
it, that it was after we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.540
left it.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.960
And well, in September 2012 he

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.860
left the job, in January 2013 we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.340
formed the society and started

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.220
to walk.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.700
How do we start?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.700
Like any real entrepreneur,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.740
no hard in the pocket.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.840
Then we have some savings, we

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
have 3,000 euros, our parents

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.740
leave us another 10,000 and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.080
then with that we build

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.060
our value proposal.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.540
But as we don't have money to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.760
do shops or anything, we address

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.020
a multi-brand customer

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.780
who at that time was more and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.840
we go to pop-ups and we go to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.920
international fairs in Paris

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.820
and London.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.000
We have our first 70 customers

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
worldwide, we sell in Europe, we

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.340
sell in Japan, we sell in the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.260
United States, we sell in

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.740
Russia, 50% are Spanish customers

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.700
and we can sell the collections

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.820
in advance, with that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.940
we produced the collection and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.020
then delivered them

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.500
and with that we earned money.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.300
And 100% of the profits were reinvested

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.340
in winning.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.940
All this on a first floor of 5 square

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.340
meters, because we could not

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.440
afford anything else, where they

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.880
came to see the collections and at

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.700
the fairs.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.320
So, in October 2013, suddenly we

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.980
say, hear, instead of being on

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.960
the first floor and only coming

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.820
multi-brand stores, why

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.220
not put ourselves on the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.220
street floor?

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.380
Maybe someone is cutting us, right?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.040
The final customer.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.500
As we saw, when we sold online,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.460
people went up to the first floor.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.700
We said, we will put it on the street floor

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.800
and we will open the first store that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.540
is on the Almirante street in October.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.140
The internet has started from the beginning.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.580
We are born into the digital

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.860
world.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.320
Well, for our age, that's what we've

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.520
lived, right?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.360
And those who come foot strong, let'

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.840
s, my friends' children know how

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.060
to mark YouTube with 3 years.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.920
So it was obvious that you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.320
could target your customers worldwide,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.380
and you also have no boundaries

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.660
through a website, right?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.280
And we opened the first store with

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.940
a very clear vocation to be international

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.400
and a value proposal very far from

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.140
the jewelry world, despite the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.360
fact that we sell jewelry,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.900
right?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.980
The store makes a profitable first

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.660
month and we bite it in three months.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.540
And from there, we built a business

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.120
model for three years because

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.400
we only set ourselves as a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.500
goal the first year, that we

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.360
fulfill goals at a 30% above

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.820
and that's why we decided to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.180
keep going.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.380
We made a series of capital expansions

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.580
to gain speed and today

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.760
we have 12 stores.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.820
Who did you do those extensions with?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.420
You or...?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.360
Business Angels only.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.020
The Business Angels?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.300
We wanted to do it because we didn't

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.120
want to get friends or family.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.800
We just wanted, not an investor, a

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.400
professional shareholder who doesn't

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.720
care to lose the money because

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.460
we're talking about real

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.940
economy.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.140
The real economy is much more complicated,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.940
right?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.180
Now it is very fashionable online ballooning,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.740
it is a bit a casino, you get

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.380
one in ten.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.840
The real economy is not going so fast.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.280
But the risk is less, right?

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.520
I think yes.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.580
Above all, we recommend it to people

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.380
who are trying to create super-innovative

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.060
products and creating a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.220
market that doesn't exist.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.600
It makes more sense to only

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.920
use professionals, Business

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.160
Angels, who know they are

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.420
basically assuming that they

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.740
will pay for money.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.720
Well, that they can diversify

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.860
on different investments

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.260
X money, without having

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.060
to be pressing you to...

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.260
It's my life in that, right?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.560
Then it's people who have the opportunity

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.100
to be able to invest in different

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.680
things and help you.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.280
So we were looking for this person,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.740
but not just for money,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.640
but because we called

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.520
Smart Money.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.900
They are people who could also

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.060
advise you to take the next steps.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.900
We once did some round

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.780
where we limited people's

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.820
ticket.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.320
That is, with close people, with

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.800
friends who want to invest, but you

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.360
can't invest more than 5,000, for

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.140
example.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.640
So that you don't feel too much pressure.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.760
Because this is too high, so we don't

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.440
want you to lose your money.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.160
and exact.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.080
It goes a little with that philosophy,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.340
but around a more professional investor.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.600
And well, thanks to that we were

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.200
also able to invest in certain

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.600
things like store opening, product

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.160
increase, in the quality of the

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.960
jewelry we offer and in

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.820
the end consumer experience,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.020
which for us is the most

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.860
important.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.300
And Jaime, to finish this introduction,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.420
what are your plans when you

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.880
see yourself in 5 years?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.480
Or in three?

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.500
3 is too many, right?

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.120
We want to double every

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.900
year.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.200
I would like to do it in the

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.820
next five.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.000
That's what we've done in the last three

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.840
years.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.440
Then it is an ambitious

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.540
proposal, because folding every year

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.640
is difficult, but we don't want

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.420
the ball of a growth to

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.420
be measured, to suddenly

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.700
climb the crust at the time, because

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.100
then, if you don't have a

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.280
good foundation, the ammon cake

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.040
is just as big.
