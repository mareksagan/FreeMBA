00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.040
I would like you to explain something,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.600
a concept that is the concept

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.120
of dilution and that is something

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.660
that comes in pair to finance

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.960
you with private capital because

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900
as investors come in they

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.220
are making capital expansions

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.640
and usually as you

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.680
will explain, not always,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.280
the founders of the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.540
company have less percentage

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.300
of the company.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.320
Just, in the end, the simplest

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.900
way to put capital inside a society

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.800
is by selling pieces, that

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.460
is, selling shares of the society

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.080
to the new people who

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.580
enter.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.640
So, to do that, what you have

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.340
to do is take away those who

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.280
are left.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.220
At that time, every time I make

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.120
a capital increase, all partners

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.140
are losing percentage,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.040
but as Borja pointed out, investors

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.180
have a way to avoid that dilution

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.760
if they are interested, which

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.040
is by bringing more capital.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.400
But the entrepreneur does not have

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.760
that ability and often, even

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.380
if he could, he does not leave it.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.240
Then, in the end, the entrepreneur

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.860
is seeing that the more money

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.460
goes into his company,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.500
the smaller it is gradually

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.200
its percentage, to reach

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.320
percentages that can be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.940
as small as 5 or 10%.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.260
I would like you to tell us how, to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.440
see, this cannot be equated to all

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.280
companies because it depends

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.180
on the model.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.260
Usually, models with greater

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.040
potential, more scalable business

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.660
models, etc., and that require

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.000
more funding, usually go

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.760
matched that founders

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.700
end up having a smaller

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.860
portion of the cake.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.240
And the opposite is, if you do a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.220
business of the traditional,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.140
if you run a bar, because you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.460
do not need it, because you can’

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.140
t grow more.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.740
But if you have a company like

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.380
Wallapop, you will need many

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.160
rounds, each time to higher

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.660
valuations, because one day you

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.120
will have a small percentage,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.360
in principle normal, of the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.060
company.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500
How are these, have we already

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.140
seen the rounds, the seed, the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.180
listing growth, etc., and how,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.140
generally, so that our students

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.680
get a little idea, how are these

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.280
percentages of dilution or

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
percentage variing in the hands

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.300
of entrepreneurs?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.800
This is part of a very interesting

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.100
basis, which is the agreement

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.460
that is established between investors

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.000
and entrepreneurs.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.000
It is an agreement in which

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.460
investors put the money, the entrepreneur

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.720
puts the work, but it is an agreement

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.980
that can be broken at any time,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.380
unilaterally, if the entrepreneur,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.960
whatever it is, says, hears,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.660
because I am no longer motivated,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.040
or I am no longer interested,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.680
or I can go out.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.360
This adds a point of uncertainty

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.580
to the investor’s investments.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.860
For the investor, the motivation

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.360
of the entrepreneur is crucial.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.320
An entrepreneur must have a very

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.060
high motivation, because an entrepreneur

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.520
who gets tired, burns and leaves,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.080
automatically loses

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.040
all the investment they have

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.120
made in that company.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.060
So, entrepreneurs start because

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.540
we are excited, because we like

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.980
it, because we want to change

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.640
the world, but we also

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.560
start for money.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.540
And starting is a very hard thing.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.500
In the end, one in three days you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.580
think about throwing the towel,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.160
you are earning two, three times

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.560
less than you could earn in the labor

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.020
market, working all the hours

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.980
of the day, and at the end there

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.340
is a phrase that says

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.360
that entrepreneurs live as

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.860
no one wants to live a few years,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.060
then live as everyone would

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.620
like to live.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.160
Then the carrots that are at the end of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.260
the stick, because they are those

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.800
hundreds of thousands or millions of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.920
euros that you expect to win when the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.600
company is sold.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.520
If you reach the end of

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.020
the tour with a very low percentage,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.740
one or two percent, it may

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.980
be that in the toughest moments

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.880
the motivation is not enough.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.360
To get this out of 10,000, 20,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.700
000 euros, I look for a

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000
normal job and I earn more next

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.040
year that I work.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.820
What would be the percentage?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.420
We are starting?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.020
A company, a startup, and the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.360
founders create the society

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.460
and have 100%?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.140
The normal...

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.000
From there down?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.880
From there down?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.080
and yes.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.220
That is, you start with the 100

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.820
and go the last day you have as you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.980
get into this of the venture capital

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.500
funds and the business angel.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.940
The industry standard, which,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.240
as we saw in the previous class,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.280
ultimately all depends on the money

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.440
you need and the percentage

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.780
you are willing to give.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.680
But one industry standard could

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.920
be said to be that in the first

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.920
round of financing you sell between

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.480
15 and 20 percent of your company.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.460
So, we are at a time when the entrepreneur

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.020
remains with 80%, cedes 15-20%

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.560
and therefore it would be like

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.040
the output shot to already

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.900
start diluting until it comes

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.160
to success.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.740
Here are a couple of interesting things.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.200
A too complicated corporate

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240
structure at the beginning in

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.100
this phase can make the company,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.000
no matter how good the product

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.720
is or how promising the startup

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.540
is, lose its attractiveness

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.780
to investors.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.600
We commented when we talked about the

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.940
different forms of financing,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.800
the round friends, families and full,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.920
when we started asking for

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.380
money to cousins, friends, so,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.080
I don’t know what, we can fall into

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.640
the error of starting to share

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.100
the equity of our company and that

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.860
when the first professional investor

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.760
comes to our society, he will find

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.220
a society in which there are

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.920
15 partners who have equally contributed

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.960
very little amount of money,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.120
who do not contribute any other

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.220
value, who are not professional

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.900
investors and who leave a structure

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.880
in which the entrepreneur

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.960
is already super diluted.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.160
Basically, of that 80, if the entrepreneur

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.100
who is the one who brings value, that is

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.840
the only one that the investor wants, because

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.690
the cousin, the uncle, I don’t know what,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.870
because it is that it does not bring

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.530
anything, if of that 80 already has a

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.310
small part, there is very little margin

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.890
already.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.210
There is very little room.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.430
And it is not only a matter of

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.410
margin that the entrepreneur has little

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.590
but also gives up to laziness.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.090
We were valuing a project a few

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.210
years ago that had a very good

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.950
look, an invention, a patent,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.670
a very spectacular thing,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.930
but that among the founding partners

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.810
was so spectacular that

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.790
they had managed to invest

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.490
everyone in their environment.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.910


00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.470
They were going to ask for money from the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.110
bank and the director of the office

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.570
was putting money, they were going to sign

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.270
the notary and the notary was putting

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.190
money, then the whole town has put

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.790
money to me, then the shareholder

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.110
was very complex.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.570
The moment we were going to arrive

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.550
we already gave a dullness bestial

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.870
because you are already anticipating

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.970
a lot of problems and really of all

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.070
of them there were very few, two in

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.390
particular, the founder and another

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.630
person who is a student of Pobre

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.730
Envía and also coincides, I am

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.450
realizing, that they were those

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.250
who brought some value, but the

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.990
rest not, the rest the only thing

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.410
I did was to bring complexity

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.510
to the shareholder.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.410
Here there would be two solutions,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.250
I would say that the ideal,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.530
that is, at the beginning,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.910
it is true that for example if you

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.670
want to attract talent, if you

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.170
have a project, a technological

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.950
idea but you do not have money to

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.490
pay a technological partner

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.010
or your first employees, you

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.530
need to incorporate people, although

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.750
as we will already see the

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.090
later it is incorporated better,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.710
it is true that equity

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.290
is a very good way to motivate

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.450
or incentivize or to attract

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.790
talent or even investment at

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.790
the beginning, but there are figures

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.630
like the phantom shares that

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.250
allow you to give options

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.190
on the equity of your company

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.790
but are not shares signed before

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.270
notaries, they do not form part

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.910
of the structure, but it

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.010
is an option that gives you

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.750
when the company is sold or

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.510
there is a liquidation

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.990
process because you take your

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.450
part, that is a very good

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.050
way to incentivize or

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.490
attract

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.290
Well then, we have described the

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.870
initial situation, which is

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.590
the first round of entry of an

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.490
investor and already has 20% of

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.630
your company and the remaining

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.510
80%, the advice we have given

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.750
is that the less diluted within

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.770
that 80 are the founders or people

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.750
who provide better value,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.250
but we will put ourselves in

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.250
the situation of a model that

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.450
needs to grow and need

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.610
to be funded and come X rounds,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.650
whatever they are.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.630
These X rounds, in addition one of the

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.170
problems that there is is that a priori

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.630
it is very difficult to predict or

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.530
know how many rounds we will have to

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.470
do and these rounds in addition what

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.550
sizes will have, then you have to apply

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.670
a principle of prudence, a good

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.530
investor told me that if you believe

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.810
your project the most expensive you

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.330
have is equity, but you have

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.070
to take care of your equity but

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.690
also without fear of losing control

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.330
or without fear of passing the

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.570
barrier of 50 % and understanding that

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.750
that money that will enter is what

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.370
will allow your company to get where

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.650
you want all that come both the

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.890
investor and the entrepreneur

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.210
that is to the final sale or

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.410
even to the exit to the stock

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.130
exchange.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.770
Yes, because in the cake as they go

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.950
giving those rounds each time the

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.510
percentage in green of entrepreneurs

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.330
is decreasing, if the entrepreneur

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.070
has an attitude that is I want

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.030
to stay with the largest percentage

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.050
possible will compromise

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.070
growth because it will enter

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.770
less money because your company

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.690
is less attractive to investors

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.690
etc.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.690
So what can happen if you have

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.670
70% of something that is not worth

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.630
anything and a competitor is

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.590
more ambitious than he but is more

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.430
unleashed from his equity and ends

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.230
up having 30% of a company that bares

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.130
the other because bares the other

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.690
because he has managed to capture

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.910
millions and millions and has

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.810
known how to use them well and

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.270
well ends up getting with the

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:53.630
market.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.190
So it’s a balance we all know entrepreneurs

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.790
who have made exits in which

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.570
they have earned a lot of money

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.810
and have managed to maintain

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.470
a high percentage of the company.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.970
Sometimes even surprising but it

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.830
is not the usual is not the vital

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.310
and if we talk about giant companies

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.890
the entrepreneurs do not know I

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.250
would like you to tell us a little

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.130
what is the standard a little

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.990
in a very valuable company exit

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.550
what percentage can aspire

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.690
to have the founder.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.630
It is true that it is very complicated.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.330
It is complicated but the photo finish

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.930
at the end when when it is sold or when

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.570
the bag is out, it usually runs

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.950
between a maximum of 20% and is already

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.690
a little exceptional and 8 or 10 12%

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.370
more or less.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.750
It should be noted that these are

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.930
very large companies.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.250
very large.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.610
It needs to be financially funded a lot.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.710
A lot of growth.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.490
They are companies in which they

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.070
have been able to enter tens

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.110
of millions or as we have already

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.030
cases in Spain hundreds of millions

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.830
of euros that is very much money.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.270
I would like you to tell us if there

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.290
is a situation in this world in

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.590
these companies and it is that before

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.690
coming to exit or before it came out

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.810
stock before these shares are liquid.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.850
There are entrepreneurs who have

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.890
already stopped being entrepreneurs

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.190
and they are entrepreneurs who are

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.710
owners of shares that are worth

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.070
a lot of money.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.250
Many millions but they can’t sell

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.750
them because investors don’t let

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.190
them go because if you are the

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.010
founder you are the engine of

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.930
a company and you tell

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.090
your board you say it’s not

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.790
that I want to sell part.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.710
This is because it generates

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.070
a perception of risk by the investor

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.270
altogether.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.250
In fact, in partnership agreements

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.210
there are clauses that regulate that

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.830
they regulate who you can sell

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.790
when you can sell.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.710
There are even a couple of clauses

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.150
that allow investors to sell

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.670
your shares to whom they want

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.150
when they want and for what they

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.650
want to avoid a little of this

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.090
type of case.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.790
I, for example, in my case at the

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.870
time of ninth box because I came to

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.210
have in notary several million euros

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.390
in shares that I could not sell or

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.590
then not to make a exit of the

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.710
company because they remained

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.370
in nothing.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.230
I was with a salary much lower

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.310
than I could be earning in

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.070
the market by working all hours

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.290
of the day with a supernormal

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.910
life but on paper it was millionaire.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.470
I know a lot of cases like that

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.890
of people who actually have

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.070
on paper if you multiply the percentage

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.350
they have for the value that

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.270
has been closed in the last

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.390
round are people who have tens

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.410
of millions of euros but have

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.430
a normal life because they have

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.670
a normal salary and because

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.030
until they don’t sell it because

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.750
that won’t materialize and what

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.750
you have to take into account

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.090
here is that it’s not easy

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.530
to sell.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.210
And the last one that can sell

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.990
is the founder curiously because the

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.790
rest are investors if the rating

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.850
has grown by 10 by 20 because there

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.530
are very many people who make

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.690
a lot of money along the way.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.190
In fact, it is very normal that

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.190
investors who enter a first

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.670
phase business angels profiles even

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.130
incubators or accelerators

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.310
of companies that in more advanced

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.570
rounds are out and in fact it

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.370
is a thing that professional

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.870
investors who enter later

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.410
rounds because it seems even

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.310
better to them.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.690
The more you pointed out at the

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.950
beginning the cleaner the company

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.230
structure and the less full

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.330
the board of directors

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.830
because professional investors

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.470
feel more comfortable.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.630
Then, as Borja said, it is very normal

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.990
that in a second third round the

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.730
accelerator that put 100 thousand

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.910
euros or 40 thousand euros in a low

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.490
valuation in the seed phase because

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.290
suddenly it comes out making

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.530
one by three one by four one

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.290
by five.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.970
At the time when a series enters

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.370
a more professional venture

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.490
capital fund.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.710
To finish I want to make it clear that

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.110
this career we are drawing is exciting

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.690
from the point of view of the entrepreneur

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.230
is exciting and really

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.110
not a lot of people have lived

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.690
not a lot of people are inside

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.030
this world of a company that

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.670
is worth millions that you are

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.430
diluting etc.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.770
But what people the number of true

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.690
hits of a million of tens of millions

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.130
that many of us know if you compare

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.930
it to the total world of entrepreneurship

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.350
at a global level is that

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.630
it is very small.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.090
In order for you to get an idea because

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.790
in Spain there can be quietly 300 accelerators

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.030
only in data accelerators that

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.430
startups that are starting there

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.430
will be thousands and the year

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.530
there are one two hits in

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.410
fat conditions.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.410
The percentage is very small I

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.110
like talking about the rounds

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.010
as an anecdote when I started in

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.630
a box a very successful Spanish

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.330
entrepreneur I just had to be

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.770
about to make a success and so

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.510
I told and I said it is not that

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.090
we just got married and I was

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.650
about to postpone the boyfriend’

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.970
s trip because I was closing

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.750
a round of funding.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.310
I at that moment thought I said

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.190
my mom or that more exaggerated

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.150
uncle you know or postponing your boyfriend

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.250
trip because it is closing a

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.990
round this uncle is fatal and then

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.350
when I saw in the funding rounds you

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.830
postponed the whole wedding boyfriend

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.610
trip and if you are pregnant you

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.990
tell the doctor that you propose

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.510
to do the cesarean before or after

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.810
to be able to close the round

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.230
because the tension is maximum

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.950
because at the end of that your

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.070
ability to raise rounds if you are

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.750
not profitable depends on the work

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.470
of a lot of people and many

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.730
hours.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.410
That has been invested and

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.490
the interests of many people.
