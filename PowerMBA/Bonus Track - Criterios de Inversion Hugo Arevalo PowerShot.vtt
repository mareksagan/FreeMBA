00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.940
You have said before that it is impossible

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.700
to have only successes, and you have

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
told an example, but the reality

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.240
is that you have demonstrated

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.480
an exceptional smell, because projects

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.000
that triumph over projects that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660
fail are very few and you have had

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.300
the luck, but not luck probably

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.160
to give with several of the great

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.660
successes.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.340
Then I would like it a lot, I think

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.260
it is if you tell us what you are looking

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.740
at, how you analyze a company,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.540
what you are looking at, whether

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.380
they are metric people, I don’t know,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.420
to invest or not to invest.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.100
Well, depending on the stage of the business,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.160
I fix myself on some variables or other,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.460
that is, in a company that you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.480
will be mounting from the start,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.360
obviously there are no metrics,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.040
I fix myself if there is capacity

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.820
for the market so that it is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.560
a model, a big business.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.120
And then, on the other hand, I got a lot...

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.480
I’m going to go for a look, right?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.180
The size of the market.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.520
The size of the market is fundamental,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680
at least for me, and that’s what

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.760
I need to know if so.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.340
Second, the idea, the business you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.180
want to build is creating real added

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.360
value, that is, there is a real competitive

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.580
advantage, that is, there are shortcomings

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860
in that sector in which you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.000
want to build it, that you

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.400
can cover by doing it better,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.080
with many fewer resources than

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.360
your competitors, because

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.820
they are much larger.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.180
Yes or not.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.980
If the answer is yes at that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.060
moment, it is when what I do is try

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.200
to surround myself with the best

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.620
team, the best team, and in the

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.600
end that choice is what will mark

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.120
your company.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.500
Then there is another

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.420
important thing, which I always

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.780
ask, is timing.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.860
I will give you a simple example so that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860
you can see it clearly.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.740
If I had 20 instead of being mounted

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.180
in 2004, when Facebook had not yet

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.800
arrived in Spain, if I had mounted

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.740
in 2008, I don’t know it with certainty,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.140
but I can assure that probably

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.480
in a very high percentage,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.340
it would not have been successful.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520


00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.200
Timing is also important.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.160
I love it, because you have

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.880
said four factors that are key,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.800
market size, value creation,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.660
because there is a problem that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.480
has not yet been solved, and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.760
also not only that it resolves

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.940
a problem, but it resolves a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.600
problem with certain competitive

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.920
advantages, in a more efficient

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.060
way than current solutions

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.480
or whatever.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.780
We said team, the third leg,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.340
and the fourth said timing.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.820
I think this is a good summary

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.280
of the four factors to be analyzed.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.840
