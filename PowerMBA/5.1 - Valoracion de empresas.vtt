WEBVTT

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.700
We will look at very briefly how

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.320
the valuation of a company is

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.100
carried out and we will introduce

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.500
the concept of valuation methods.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.500
Before we start, I want you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.880
to keep in mind, if there is

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.920
any doubt, that valuation of companies

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.960
is not a science.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.820
I would say it is art.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.360
What do I mean by this?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.520
Well, there really is no single

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.560
method or mathematical formula

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440
that allows us to reach a value

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.500
and that this value is undisputed,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.180
whether the target value

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.040
of the company.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.660
No to.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800
A review is really an opinion.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.280
This is an opinion that each

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.980
party has.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.400
In an operation, usually, since

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.120
a purchase-sale, capital

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.400
expansion, etc. operation

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.760
is involved, there are different

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.180
parties involved.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.440
For we have, for example, the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.060
owners or partners, we have

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.180
the managers, we have the potential

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.600
investors or buyers,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660
whether they are private

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.840
investors or funds, etc.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.180
In addition, analysts or, well,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.400
the advisors of the manie often

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.380
participate.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.400
The parties do use or apply

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.300
one or more methods of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.420
valuation.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.120
Each comes to its own assessment.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.560
Owners, for example, use one or

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.940
more methods, those they consider

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.600
appropriate, and determine

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.040
that their company is worth 300

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.120
million.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.440
And investors do the same and say

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.280
they don't consider the company

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.080
worth more than 200 million.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.320
Well, we already have a framework of reference,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.220
and from there you will come

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.520
to an agreement or not.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.300
What we will do now is, let'

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.780
s identify what are the main

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.420
valuation methods, the most accepted

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.000
or the most well-known.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.410
We can really say that we

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.730
have three different

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.330
perspectives from which we

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.390
can come to or estimate the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.770
value of a company.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.190
And it is convenient to use several

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.270
perspectives in a complementary

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.170
way, because it can help us, well,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.430
to have a greater perspective,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.210
being redundant, and not falling

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.890
into inconsistencies.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.970
Let us see them.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.650
The first is the value of the assets.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.590
We can value a company based

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.650
on the value of its assets.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.450
How will we get to the value of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.070
the assets?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.790
There are different formulas.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.930
We can do this, for example,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.630
from what books say, what accounting

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830
says, which would be the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.070
accounting value.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.290
We go to the balance sheet and see

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.550
how much is the net accounting value,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.030
for example, that we deduct the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.310
value of liabilities or debts

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.150
from the value of the asset.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.850
Another concept is the adjusted

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430
accounting value.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.510
Adjusted to what?

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.290
Adjusted to market value.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.030
Imagine you have an asset that is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.770
accounted for at purchase price.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.610
We compared a property five years ago

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.350
for 300,000 euros and in the market

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.510
now is worth 600,000.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.390
Well, then this common sense that we

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.230
should adjust the accounting value.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.190
What I want you to understand about

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.230
the value of this perspective, from

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.430
this first perspective, of valuing

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.670
through the value of assets,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.430
is that it is a limited perspective.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.570
Why is it?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.070
Because it doesn't take into account how

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.910
much these assets will generate in the future.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.270
Basically, when you buy a business,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.430
what you are buying is a series

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.890
of future cash flows.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.690
However, if the only thing

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.150
we value is the value of

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.270
assets today, we are not

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.310
losing all that.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.290
The second is the market.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.870


00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.430
In this case, what we will do is

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.210
draw conclusions about how other

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.470
companies are being evaluated.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.910
This is a reference.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.910
We analyze the value of other

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.430
companies, draw conclusions

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.370
and from there we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.230
value ours.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.710
It is done through the multiple.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.330
The multiple ones that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.030
they do is to relate

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.050
the value of a company

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.790
to some of the key

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.870
indicators, the most

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.750
important indicators,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.590
such as sales, EBITDA,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.950
net profit, etc.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.110
So you look at other companies

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.130
and say, well, the companies

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.850
in my sector are valued 7.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.310
Well, and that is a reference

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.330
framework, a reference to

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.530
value yours.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.150
Because you say, if my EBITDA is

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.450
one million euros, my company, applied

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.950
multiple, is worth 7 million.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.130
Here we have to make a distinction, we

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.170
usually make it between, when we

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.550
look at co-opted companies, in which

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.390
the information is very transparent,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.770
and in addition it is that the only

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.330
thing that we compare with the corresponding

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.710
indicators, and we calculate

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.490
the multiple.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.970
In the case of non-cotized

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.450
companies, imagine that we want

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.310
to value a pharmacy, what we

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.550
do is, we will apply the multiple,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.030
but we will apply it from transactions

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.070
or operations that have

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.790
already been carried out.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.610
For example, let's put it in

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.490
place, pharmacies are selling

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.690
to a multiplier of annual

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.390
sales by 1.5, between 1.5 and

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.110
2.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.050
Well, because that is the multiple

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.330
I will use as a reference to

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.890
evaluate my pharmacy if I want

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.390
to sell it.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.950
And last, the last of the prospects

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.630
is the discount of cash

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.590
flows.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.450
It is the most complicated one, we'

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.210
ll learn to do it, but it's the most orthodox one.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.310
What you help us, regardless

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.750
of what happens in the market,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.750
is to calculate or estimate

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.170
the value of our company

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.410
based on the future cash

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.490
flows it will generate.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.730
You already understand how the

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.990
discount of cash flows works, as we

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.470
will apply it to the valuation of

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.170
companies.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.110
We will project cash flows,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.170
we who know what is going to

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.810
happen, and we will discount

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.270
it at the cost of capital.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.770
We will see it in more detail.
