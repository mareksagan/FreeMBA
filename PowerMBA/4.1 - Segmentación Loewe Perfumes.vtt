To finish, we are going to analyze what Silvia has told us and we are going to relate it

00:11.400 --> 00:14.600
to the segmentation variables that we have learned.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.440
She told us that they have traditionally segmented based on the geography where their

00:19.440 --> 00:25.600
clients live and mainly based on demographic factors such as age, sex and

00:25.600 --> 00:30.440
socio-cultural level, taking into account that the OEB is a luxury product.

00:30.440 --> 00:36.720
They have also incorporated an analysis of profiles, which is the psychographic segmentation,

00:36.720 --> 00:41.600
such as personality, cosmopolitan position, lifestyle, etc.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.640
And all this, all these variables, which are the traditional ones, what they allow us to

00:46.640 --> 00:49.400
know is who our clients are.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.420
But as she said, they are useless because what they are not useful for us is to understand

00:54.420 --> 01:00.140
why they buy us from our clients, which is very valuable, it is very valuable knowledge.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.020
And what is the evolution of all this?

01:02.020 --> 01:07.780
Well, on the one hand, thanks to the internet, thanks to all the interactions on social networks,

01:07.780 --> 01:12.580
etc., we have a lot more information about the clients, therefore we can make a much

01:12.580 --> 01:18.580
greater segmentation, even in the perfume, as Silvia told us, it could be given the total

01:19.580 --> 01:23.900
segmentation, that is, that each person will buy a different perfume adapted to their tastes.

01:23.900 --> 01:30.180
And also, the last thing she told us is that the brands are doing is

01:30.180 --> 01:35.100
overcoming the product-centric approach, stop looking at the navel and start thinking

01:35.100 --> 01:37.540
why they buy from the clients.

01:37.540 --> 01:43.180
This is the last of the segmentations and it is the perspective that we always propose

01:43.180 --> 01:45.420
that all companies incorporate.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.660
Why do they buy from us?

01:46.660 --> 01:47.900
What are they looking for in us?

01:48.220 --> 01:58.140
But look, she even proposed in the perfume sector to go further and what we can do

01:58.140 --> 02:05.180
is not segment by person, that is, this person looks for us to determine the thing, this person

02:05.180 --> 02:06.180
another thing, etc.

02:06.180 --> 02:11.780
No, we can go further and segment each person or analyze them depending on the moments

02:11.780 --> 02:13.860
of their life.

02:13.860 --> 02:22.180
A person can be a traveler because he travels recurrently and spends all the weeks

02:22.180 --> 02:28.220
at an airport and can buy a perfume and also, as he is a husband, every so often he likes

02:28.220 --> 02:29.740
to make a gift.

02:29.740 --> 02:34.980
We are analyzing people based on what they are looking for in us and also based

02:34.980 --> 02:38.220
on what they are looking for in each of the moments of their life.
