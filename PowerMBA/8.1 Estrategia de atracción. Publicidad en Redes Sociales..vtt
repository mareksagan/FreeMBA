WEBVTT

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.330
Well, what I'm going to do

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.690
now is share with you a series,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.310
an analysis of Social Media

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.110
Advertising so we understand

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.250
why it's so powerful, why

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.430
it's grown so much and why

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.150
it's so beneficial for.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.740
We will highlight six factors.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.120
One is the scope.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.300
This is obvious, it is common sense.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.240
Each of these platforms has

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240
hundreds of millions, billions

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.380
of users.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.800
This is a great advantage because it allows

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.580
you to grow very, very obviously.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.720
The second is segmentation.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.860
Social media is taking segmentation

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.640
to the extreme.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.960
There is no one who has so much

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.320
data that allows you to segment so much.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.780
I will give you an example.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.500
Do you want to do a campaign where

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.780
you want to target Product Managers

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.280
of companies that have between

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.500
50 and 150 employees?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.100
You can do it on LinkedIn.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.640
You can segment to that point.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.340
The third is commitment.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.260
This is a broad concept, but if we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.760
compare it with other types of strategies

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.160
you will understand it well.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.860
You when you make ads, you make an ad,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.080
because it does the same on television

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.560
or a banner in a digital medium,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.680
for example.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.320
It's outbound marketing, you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.300
impact it, and so on.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960
There is no bidirectionality.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.580
When it comes to social media,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.100
it is a little different.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.600
Today we are talking about advertising

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.160
on social media.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.780
That is, we are paying to impact

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.940
you, but still there is more engagement,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.300
there is more bidirectionality.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.100
Why is?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.600
For many reasons.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.160
Because that person can like,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.880
comment, follow you,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.940
because you can do so through

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.460
different profiles, personal

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.840
profiles, etc.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.360
It's true that it's push marketing,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.560
but it's more bidirectional and that

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.820
generates more engagement with

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.540
that audience you impact.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.480
And already, for example, if you get

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.000
him to follow you, then you will be

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.040
able to impact him in a different way.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.660
Another very important factor to take

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.320
into account is that social

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.700
networks, these platforms allow

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040
us to manage the entire conversion

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.060
funnel, allow us from making prospecting,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.740
which would be to impact people

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
who don't know us or who have never

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.720
impacted us, then do all the follow-

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.900
up, go down, go doing all

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.200
the nurturing, capture the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.580
lead, convince you, make

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.000
offers to those who have

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
bought, return to impact

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.860
them, etc.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.060
This is an advantage.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.240
And as always I want to compare it with

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.920
other channels so that you understand

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.120
the If we make an advertisement on television,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.580
we impact it on television

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.740
and it's already.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.100
And then maybe you get to our website

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.840
or you don't get or whatever.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.080
And the extreme is the social network,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.300
in which we can impact you thousands

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.320
of times in different formats and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.560
with different messages.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000
Prospecting, leads generation,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.920
nurturing, sale, repetition,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.020
fidelization, etc.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.260
We can manage the whole funnel,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.360
stay with that.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
Another advantage is that social

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.220
media, this type of advertising,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.380
is very conversion-oriented.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.500
It is very oriented to your final goals,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.720
which is not only generating traffic,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.780
but capturing the lead or generating

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.100
sales, etc.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.760
Generating of income.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.740
We go to the extreme again.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.980
We are going to make a radio

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.820
campaign.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.160
What do you get from the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.840
radio campaign?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.720
Do you get awareness?

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.600
Do you get branding?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.540
Do you get people to know you?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.660
We have sometimes made radio

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080
campaigns trying to generate

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.220
traffic, for example, for

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.780
an app, for a landing page.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.940
There was no traffic.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.860
What you were doing was positioning

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.180
yourself in the minds of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.180
millions of people.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.520
Social networks are different.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.380
In social media, we always invest

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.600
with a very direct

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.420
conversion goal.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.820
And that is what we measure.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.260
On the platforms, you'll see it

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.580
on Facebook, it allows us to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.620
measure absolutely all metrics

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.720
instantly.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.280
If you are generating lead, if you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.940
are generating purchases, etc.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.920
It is therefore more aligned with

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.120
the objectives usually set by

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.780
companies.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.880
Most importantly, the companies

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.520
that we want is conversion, that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.140
what we want is short-term income.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.280
And finally, I want you to keep in

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.500
mind that they are easy to use platforms,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.740
which are very developed,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.640
very optimized and that you can

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.720
get in, sign up to your account

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.260
and within half an hour you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.160
will have ads in motion.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.820
This is also an advantage, in addition

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.820
to the fact that the minimum investment

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.180
is very small, etc.
