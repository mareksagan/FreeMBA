WEBVTT

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.940
We will use a case to analyze

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.160
which metrics would be appropriate

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.540
and which would not be

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.480
appropriate.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.300
Let's think of an application like

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.320
Tulotero.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.760
In one application, basically,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.200
invest in customer capture,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.720
they usually generate traffic on

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.160
your website, and the website you

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.480
have to convert, from the visits

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.880
you have to get people to download

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.720
the app on the smartphone,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.940
and, in addition, after, the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.360
next step, the next challenge

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.980
is that users who have downloaded

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.340
the app, because in an application

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.160
like Tulotero, they end up becoming

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.100
customers, they put

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.840
their data on the credit

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.900
card, and they end up

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.720
being players, and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.880
the more recurrent it is better.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.400


00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.780
We have drawn the tunnel.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.300
Well, what are the metrics

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.760
Eric Rice tells us we shouldn'

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.660
t be looking at?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.560
Well, if at Tulotero we are permanently

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.960
making improvements, product improvements,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.860
improvements about how we

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.800
communicate the value proposal,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500
incorporating new functionalities,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.980
etc., it is a continuous process,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.980
if we only look at that

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.760
sales are growing, that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.960
percent grow a lot, or

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420
the number of users,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.980
we are losing a lot of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.820
information.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.420
The metrics that come in that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.980
case could be sales or the number

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.740
of users.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.660
We'd be losing a lot of things,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.100
and now we'll see.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.240
We'll think we want to measure

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.460
the progress in terms of whether

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.800
we have a proposal that you

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400
like, whether people feel

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.560
the need to download an app

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.640
to buy the lottery, whether

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.280
they like our solution, whether

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.280
they like the experience

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.420
of buying lottery in an app, etc.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.360
How can we measure it?

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.440
So, let's look at a few

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.020
metric.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We could use, for example, the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.660
cost per lead.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.200
Why is it?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.960
Because if you are doing campaigns

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.680
on different channels of capture and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.300
really nobody would have an interest

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.920
in what you are offering, because

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.800
you would pinch very few people

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.780
on those links and the cost per

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.280
lead would be very high.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.760
If what we do is measure how

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400
the cost per lead evolves over

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.500
time, well, because we can draw

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.040
certain conclusions that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.200
can help us improve.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.800
There are metrics that are

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.660
very important that are

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.960
those related to conversion.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.020
In the case of your lottery, we could

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.360
define, for example, the number of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.440
facilities split by the number

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.720
of visits to the website.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.500
How many people access our

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.560
website by downloading the app?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.520
If we are continuously making improvements

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.280
on the website, improvements in how

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.520
we communicate our proposal,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.220
well, because this metric allows

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.860
us to know if we are on the right

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.780
track or not.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.300
But if we didn't measure this,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.640
if we only measured the evolution

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.340
in sales volume, we would be

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.720
losing, we couldn't

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.000
identify why it's selling

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.580
more.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.880
What is?

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.680
Why have we improved our

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.200
website?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.300
Why have we added new features

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.680
to the application?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.400
Why is it?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.720
Why are we investing more in marketing?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.620
We would not know.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.920
Instead, with this type of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.840
metrics like the one we are

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.180
seeing, the number of installations

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.560
split by the people who visit the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.020
website.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.400
We have isolated the effect.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.400
Another metric related to the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.900
conversion would be the number

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.320
of active users, i.e. the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.340
number of people who end up

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.020
becoming players, split by the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.760
number of total installations.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.660
If we are making improvements in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.640
the application, incorporating

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520
new functionalities, this should

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.580
be one of the metrics that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.720
we are constantly analyzing.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.920
And in fact, when you give up on

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.160
an improvement that really

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.100
has an impact, you can quickly

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.280
see this type of ratio as it increases.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.980
It is a good sign.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.640
And vice versa, if you

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.840
are mistaken, the metric would

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.420
probably go down.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.540
Other very important metrics

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.120
that your app works well, that

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.940
people like it, and that you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.640
also have to measure

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.120
permanently, is recurrence.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.580
In this case, your lottery is very

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.880
important, because it is a product

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.300
thought to be very recurrent.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.840
In order for people who like to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.900
buy the lottery, usually buying it

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.020
every week, we have to measure

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.500
with what recurrence they

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.620
resort to your lottery.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.680
Or the opposite metric,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.760
the opposite, which is the chan

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.960
rate, measure what percentage

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.320
of our users are giving off.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.640
And we would have to strive

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.040
permanently to improve the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.060
application, improve customer service,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.940
etc.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.020
Improve the identification with the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.160
brand so that the soil rate is increasingly

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.960
low.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.280
In addition, in the case of your lottery,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.680
in the case of an application of

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.240
this type, thought to have a very

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.700
long customer lifetime value, and

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.300
a great recurrence, it is very

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.360
important to permanently

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.300
monitor the chan rate.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.240
Or we can do surveys, use

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.180
typical metrics, related

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.360
to customer satisfaction, such

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.440
as NPS surveys, for example,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.640
or measure the number of customers

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.900
who are prescribers, who

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.640
recommend us to a

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.800
third party, etc.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.040
As you can see, all these metrics

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.360
can give us very good information,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.120
a very good perspective

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.380
on whether we are on the right

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.340
path or not, and also isolate

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.540
each of the actions we

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.700
are doing.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.080
How can we measure that profitability

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.580
is improving?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.420
What are we doing to improve

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.740
the model's profitability?

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.560


00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.980
The metric is the one you already

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.640
know, the most common.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.080
In this case it would be the ARP.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.260
We should constantly measure

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.380
the average expenditure

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.360
of customers in a year.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.760
If you do things well, it should

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.180
grow, because you're improving customer

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.640
engagement, that generates

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.660
more spending, etc.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.600
And the other metric that you also

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.820
know is the customer lifetime value

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.860
minus the cost of acquisition

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.460
that depends on the ARPU and also

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.220
depends on whether you are

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.100
using the capture channels well.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.800
If we want to use metrics to know

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.340
if we are on the right track and

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.700
we are finding the most suitable

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.140
channels.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.940
Well, because here metrics are

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.820
usually very common and is, for example,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.220
the cost per lead.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.920
How much does it cost to bring

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.960
a lead to the website?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.460
Or how much does it cost us to

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.580
capture a user who installs

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.280
in the app or who ends up being

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280
a buyer user?

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.500
What is the customer lifetime value?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.340
Because in the capture channels it is

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.680
important to also keep in mind that

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.200
not only you have to measure how much

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.460
it costs you to bring a customer,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.640
but if you are testing different

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.780
channels, it is interesting to

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.740
keep in mind that you can be capturing

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.640
users of different profile that

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.200
at the end of some are more

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.580
profitable than others.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.000
In a channel, it can cost you very

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.800
little to capture new customers, but

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.760
it turns out you don't buy any, for example.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.360
Well, and finally, it's very

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.920
interesting to do permanently

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.760
with this scheme that we've seen

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.100
of identifying metrics and

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.900
being permanently measuring

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.520
them to see if all we're doing,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.780
that continuous product

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.020
development learning

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.740
process, is having any impact

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.840
or not.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.640
It is very useful to do a B test.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.200
It is very useful to do concrete

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.520
experiments by comparing two hypotheses

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.220
and seeing whether one of the two,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.560
A or B, has a positive or

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.340
better impact on these metrics

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.060
that we have identified as important.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.020
For example, we have developed a

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.980
new functionality in the app

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.500
that allows you to subscribe to a

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.840
number, to say something.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.820
What is what we do?

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.940
What you can do is activate it with

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.760
two groups, do a test to B, activate

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.120
it only with a percentage of customers

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.000
and measure whether in group A or

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200
in control group, one of the important

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.920
metrics, for example, monthly spending

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.040
or recurrence, is increasing and

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.540
that allows you to isolate the

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.600
effects of that change you have

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.100
made and allows you to see

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.060
if you are on the right track

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.080
or not.
