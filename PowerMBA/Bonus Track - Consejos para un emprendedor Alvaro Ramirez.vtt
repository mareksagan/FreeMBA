00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.990
What advice would you give an

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.610
entrepreneur?

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.470
Someone who just created their

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.090
new project.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.340
Well, first I would say things

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.540
that are said very

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.020
often, but I want to emphasize

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.100
that failure is a success.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.440
There are very few entrepreneurs who have

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.980
success in their first project.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.020
I think statistics are like bonoloto.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.740
That is, more or less the same as the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.540
statistics of the bonoloto.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.140
The good thing is that you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.520
have opportunities and that you probably

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.460
have a huge learning opportunity

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.740
every time you do something of this.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.080
Frustration because a first

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.600
project has not gone well or

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.960
not ended kills half or 95% of

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.060
entrepreneurs.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.300
But we have to be realistic.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.660
How many projects are undertaken

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.460
in the world every day?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.040
How many are successful?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.560
How many are not successful?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.500
How many times do you have to undertake?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.100
What learning have you had?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.680
What variation of what you did two

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.480
years ago do you want to do now?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.700
I want to be realistic because

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.680
the rest is not realistic.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.020
Some people are doing a project.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.260
I was very lucky.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.840
I was in the 20 hours a day because

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.000
it was what I most wanted at that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.540
time and I was able to carry

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.780
out that project.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420
But that doesn't mean I've undertaken

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.600
many other things afterwards

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.700
and I haven't been able to put

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.080
them in place.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.620
Probably hundreds.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.420
Then I'd give you the biggest

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.160
advice is to stay with

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.820
learning if you're not able.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.080
Try it again, okay.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.960
Be constant in what you are doing.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.840
Don't look at the short, look

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.800
at the long.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.020
I have had success

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.580
many times.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.820
I remember a very curious thing because

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.060
there have been times of undertaking

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.440
within what is already the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.960
company.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540
I remember when we launched the Plus Elite

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.520
Account and it was a very curious

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.360
experience.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.140
We had our famous Plus Account of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.420
X money and we launched the Premium,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.560
the huge, which was a bet, imagine,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.100
it was all new.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.680
We made a setup, market studies,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.260
launched it and in the first

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.300
year we sold 25 units.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.360
The biggest failure in our history.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.720
Today, Plus Elite accounts for 70%

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.620
of the group's turnover.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.820
I think billions, billions.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.140


00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.800
What did we?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.420
For we changed the equation,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.480
we repositioned, that is, we were

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.640
able to find, we were persevering,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.020
in agreement, and we gave with

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.600
that key.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.180
And today it is the biggest success

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.740
the company has had, in agreement.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.620
Then, this is an example of perseverance,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.320
of re-focusing something that

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120
was a huge failure.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.060
And I remember that most of my

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.980
team said to me, forget, I said,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.760
we can't forget, we can't

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.340
forget because it's a bet

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.120
of us, we can't forget because

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.700
it gives a continuity to the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.640
vision we are having.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.300
Then, if we forget, we have

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.120
failed, right?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.520
And as we don't want to fail, years

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.660
have passed and that's the result.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.300
I will then summarize these

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.020
two important advice.
