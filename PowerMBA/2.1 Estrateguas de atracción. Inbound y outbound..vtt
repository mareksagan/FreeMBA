WEBVTT

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.020
We are at the top of the funnel

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.360
that is the top of the funnel and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.040
here you already know what

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
we want is basically generate

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.880
traffic, attract visitors to our

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.800
website.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680
Well, what we want is that there

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.680
is the largest volume possible,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.080
the better, the lowest possible

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400
cost and also not only is a matter

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.260
of quantity but it is a very

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.580
important matter of quality,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.460
that those visits be visits

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.820
of quality, that is, that it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940
is people who have a certain interest

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.080
in our value proposal,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.800
because otherwise it will

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.540
not buy us.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.840
If we get a million visits every

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.640
month from Chinese, who don'

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.500
t understand Spanish, well,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560
because even if we cost very

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960
little each of those visits,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.020
we are really taking

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.760
the money.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.720
The important thing here at this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.340
level is that you know what the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.040
tools are, the channels that can

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.460
be used to contribute to those

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.500
goals, to generate more traffic

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.040
at a lower cost of more quality

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.260
and there are many channels and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.040
what we have to do is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.740
know them, understand how each

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.320
of them works, what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.360
implications they have, what

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.260
is the cost, what is the effort

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.280
to develop it, etc. And from

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.100
there we will have to make a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.380
mix and opt for the channels

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.840
that jointly help us

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.800
to reach our goals.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
What I am going to do now is, I

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.400
will name them, I will explain

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440
them in a very short way and we will

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.180
leave you information if you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.240
want to go deeper.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.940
We'll sort the channels into two blocks,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.260
as we've seen in Outbound Marketing

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.920
and Inbound Marketing and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.720
we'll start with the Outbound.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.660
How can we impact our customers

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.000
by making an investment and paying

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.180
for that traffic?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.160
First, we cannot avoid offline

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.720
campaigns, advertising on

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.600
radio, television, in the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.720
press, making telemarketing,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.160
buzzing, etc.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.320
In this case it is not performance,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.180
that is, we will not pay in

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.300
particular, we will not be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.760
able to variate our investment, we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.440
will make an investment in a campaign

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.400
and we will see how much traffic

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.580
we generate.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.580
It is also normal to opt for online

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.500
campaigns and online campaigns

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.960
we can do in very different

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.480
ways, for example in social

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.980
media, social media

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340
marketing, hiring ads on

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.660
Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.480
We can opt for search engine

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.860
marketing, which is SEM, that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.080
when someone does a search,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.300
you appear on the top on the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.320
right and for every person

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.240
who clicks on you is costing

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.560
you.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.940
We can choose to do online advertising

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180
in display format, in video

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.160
format, in banners, this is very

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.320
broad.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.000
It is very broad in terms of different

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.160
formats and in terms of the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.720
channels in which we can appear.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.820
You can appear on social media,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.560
you can appear on forums,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.440
you can appear on other

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.880
websites, etc.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.320
You can, as I said, do it in

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.140
very different ways.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.420
There are also very different

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.700
ways to hire this.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.960
You can hire it directly to the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.840
medium, you can do it through

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.700
an agency or you can, for

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.020
example, use programming, which

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.560
is something we'll see, which

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.740
allows you to very agile

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.420
to hire space on a lot of media

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.020
at a time.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.460
You will see that it is very interesting.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.540
Another important concept is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.460
remarketing or retargeting, which

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.120
is what we do to impact

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.260
people who have visited

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.440
us or who have liked a post

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.940
on a social network, etc.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.880
Email marketing.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.660
Basically email marketing is

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.580
to make a massive emailing,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.660
communicating our proposal

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.960
and we can do it in different

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.860
ways too, with a base we have

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.020
or do it through an agency

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.340
that has its databases,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.960
etc.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.620
Or we can choose to do campaigns

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.020
with influencers, which usually what

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.780
you do is to hire an influencer

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.120
who makes a video or sponsors

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.580
a video of him or she recommends

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.080
you, for example, putting

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.820
a Twitter, etc.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.460
We also have the alternatives of

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580
the inbound channels and the most

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.500
known is SEO, which allows us to

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.540
be well positioned search engines

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.000
and when someone does a search,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.100
you appear, but in this case

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.680
the traffic does not cost you and

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.620
is a very sustainable

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.500
way to generate traffic.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.200
The ass is the same, but for

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.100
mobile apps to be well positioned

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.680
in Google Play or

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.960
iOS stores.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.980
When you do a search, imagine

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.200
you want to download an app

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.540
to check the weather, the

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.240
weather.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.280
You put the time and there

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.880
are several.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.760
The best positions are those that have

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.700
the most options.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.560
It works just like SEO.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.860
More inbound marketing strategies,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.080
well, because what is called

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.680
content marketing.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.180
Generate valuable content on social networks,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.780
blogs, in newsletters, on different

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.500
sites, which what it does is that

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.220
you are generating a lot

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.220
of traffic.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.500
Or, for example, PR, which

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.640
are public relations, which

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.780
we will do is try

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.800
to manage so that the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.160
media talk about us.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.320
Well, as I said, what you have

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.140
to have is the perspective of all,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.580
of which are the different

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.860
alternatives.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.480
And what we have to do is make

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.860
a comparison between all of them

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.320
based on different variables

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.240
to see which are the ones that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.080
are most suitable for us.
