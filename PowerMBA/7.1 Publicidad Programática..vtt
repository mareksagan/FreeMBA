00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.090
Javi, I'll ask you, that's a challenge

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.030
because this is very complicated,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.250
to see if you try to explain

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.050
to your grandmother how programmatic

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.270
advertising works,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.830
the trips that are behind.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.370
The process, if it is complicated, I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.610
will try to explain it in the simplest

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.210
way possible without getting into technology

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.550
or in very technical terminology

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.650
so that we can understand it Let

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
us say we go back to what we always

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.690
have, we have two parts.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.490
We have the part of the purchase

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.930
where the advertiser would be,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.170
the advertiser wants to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.630
buy advertising to a certain

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.390
goal and on the other hand we

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.850
have the side of the sale, where

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.210
the supports are and that therefore

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.430
are those who offer their inventory

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.890
to the advertisers so that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.050
they can buy those spaces

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.070
they need.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.810
Between the mediums of the two layers there

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.830
is a technological process that gives

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.030
support and optimizes for both sides.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.390
So what does the advertiser do with

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.070
all of these capabilities we have

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.870
talked about that has programmatic

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.570
advertising?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.850
Directly what it does is to say, hear,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530
I for this campaign determined

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.810
what I want is to impact a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.010
type of very determined audience

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.170
and if it can be at a cost that

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130
does not exceed Then, all that

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.070
gets in a small batcher and is

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.950
sent to a neutral platform

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.290
that is called The Change, which

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.910
let us say can function as a fish

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.270
lounge that is, they come

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.270
there with a demand of an audience

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.550
at a price that does not

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.230
ideally mean x euros and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.910
on the other hand in that

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.610
same lounge who comes is the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.430
part of the sale, the supports.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.970
The supports have an inventory and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.670
they will be the ones who decide

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.310
what part of their inventory they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.590
want to put inside that lonja

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.890
and want to make it available

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.910
to the market.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.390
And they also offer it with a series

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.550
of attributes, because when you go to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.150
browse the internet by putting a very

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.070
simple example and you put the country.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.490
com before even that it loads

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.010
the page, all that information

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.570
is already sent to the information

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.110
of who is loading the page, the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.730
attributes that accompany it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.050
and therefore is being put

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290
that user at the disposal of the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.970
market so that the market

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.570
can go for him.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.630
So basically we have an advertiser

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.030
who wants a user with certain

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.510
attributes and a support that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.950
offers that user with

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.130
those certain attributes.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150
When you see what the part of the purchase

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.750
is to go for it, this is a bidding

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.050
system, but not only bidding that

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.950
advertiser, they will go for all

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.830
those advertisers who are looking

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.010
for users with the same attributes.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.430
So basically who wins or who paints

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.730
the impression we call in advertising

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.310
is ultimately the one who has

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.430
paid or offered more money,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.450
but will pay only one penny more

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.570
than the second one who has

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.350
put the most.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.550
It is what is called that Comprice

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.870
Auction and it does not only

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.210
work in advertising but in other

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.550
auction models, so that you offer

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.170
a maximum price, you will pay a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.530
penny more than the second one

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.050
that has risen most and finally

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.930
you will take that impression

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.910
in such a way that you efficiency

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.970
in the impact, because

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.310
you are impacting that user

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.410
that you only want to impact,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.250
at a cost never higher than

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.750
you would be willing to pay,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.350
in an immediate and totally

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.290
automatic way.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.470
Because all this information you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.010
load on a console, the support

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.510
you load on its console and the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.590
whole process works automatically.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.510
And the most magical and wonderful

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.490
thing about this process is that all

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.470
this I have told you works in less

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.790
than 0.1 milliseconds, that is, since

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.770
you have put the name of the page

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.970
you want to enter before that page

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.530
is loaded, all this has already passed

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.230
and the advertising impact

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.890
you receive will be that of the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.070
one who has rushed to impact you

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.510
at that moment with that message.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.230
This phenomenal explained and I only

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.790
have a doubt, it is perfectly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.830
understood how you issue a request,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.070
the advertiser.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.210
Javi, it has been phenomenal

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.690
explained, I only have a doubt and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.070
I will put the situation.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.990
I am the advertiser and I want to

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.270
impact and I will go back to the example

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.390
before, I want to impact men

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.430
35 years old and I issue the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.930
request to the platform.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.670
And we have the other side of

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.910
the supports, the websites and others

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.850
that are selling that inventory.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.130
What I would like to know is

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.850
because those media,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.430
media, etc., are visiting

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.450
the man of 35 years, who

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.310
is who I want to impact

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.470
and I want the ad, my

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.390
ad, I want my ad to be printed,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.850
but also the man of 35

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.210
months, 22, but I don'

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.790
t want it to come out.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.490
So what I don't know is how the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.590
technology platform manages

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.710
to square this.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.630
To explain it in a simple way and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.470
that's why it's so beautiful programming

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.610
and that's why it's so efficient,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.190
it's because it's able to

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.150
outsource it.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.590
That is, what you have to be able to

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.370
do with the system is to recognize

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.770
that what the support is offering

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.230
is already going with that feature.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.330
That is, you hear, I am a certain

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.430
support, I am the country and

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.350
I am offering to the system before

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.550
it loads on my page, when a user

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.390
has searched my page, before

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.930
my page loads, I am able to

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.310
tell the system that that

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.230
user who is getting into

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.690
is 35 years old.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.030
That is, the country knows when the 35-

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.450
year-old visits you, when the 22-year-old

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.770
visits you.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.710
You can know if you have the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.550
ability to recognize that user

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.310
with the data capabilities you

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.270
have, either from your date or your

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.010
first party data, from the date

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.070
you are collecting from your

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.070
users in your browsing, or from

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.870
third parties that are data

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.950
providers that can, say, hyper

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.990
qualify that user.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.830
So, let's say that a rating is produced

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.530
of each of the users that has some

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.890
attributes that are offered

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.910
to the system and when an advertiser

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.970
says hears, to me what I'm

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.510
interested is only users

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.370
35 years old.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.850
If the support offers me that user

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.810
of 35 years and I see that he is a user

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.310
of 35 years and therefore I am interested,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.870
I will go for him.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.950
If you are not able to offer it to me,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.690
I will not even see it, I will not know

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.270
who you are, you will not interest me

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.630
and therefore I will never go for you with

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.870
what is on the one hand what I ask and

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.610
on the other hand what they offer me.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.650
If you are able to offer me what I ask

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.450
for, I will go up for it and if not,

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.970
it will never happen, the encounter

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.130
will never happen.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.110
Many thanks.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.770
to you.
