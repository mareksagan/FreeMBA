00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.420
To understand a balance sheet

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.460
well we have to know the first thing

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.720
that on the right side we have

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720
the origins of financing, that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.380
is, it informs us of where the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.820
funds come from.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.900
On the left side we have the other

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.380
perspective that is where we have

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.600
invested those funds, which

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.380
are the assets.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.320
We go with the right side, with

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.400
the sources of funding.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.440
Here we have three large masses.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.920
Current liabilities

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.260
are debts that have a

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.580
maturity of less than

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.940
one year.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.560
We have non-current liabilities,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.960
which are debts with a maturity

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.940
greater than the year, and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.740
we also have our own funds.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.980
Permanent resources

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.260
are called the own funds

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.080
and non-current liabilities.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.940


00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.490
On the asset side, what is it that

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.930
we have?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.270
We have assets that are more

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.090
liquid, called current assets.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.470
The criterion here is that they

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990
are assets that will be converted

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.750
in principle into treasury in

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.850
less than a year.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.870
They are usually the most

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.230
operational assets, related to

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.310
the company’s own activity.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.310
And then you have the assets that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.390
are not liquid, which are called

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.670
non-current, but good that they are

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.570
the immovilized, the fixed assets, etc.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.790
As you can see, we have classified all

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.270
of the assets and their requirements.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.250
Basically, we have two

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.790
large blocks.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.230
Permanent assets and non-current

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.650
assets, say they have a longer

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.510
term, and current assets

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.430
and non-current liabilities,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.030
which are more liquid

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.010
or are debts that have a higher

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.270
demand, that is, that will

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.930
expire in the next year.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.030
When we talk about the structure

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.750
of capital, we are talking about

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.830
the proportion of foreign funds

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.090
and own funds, that is, how we have

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.230
funded ourselves.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.850
This can be seen in the balance sheet.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.010
As we have seen before, on the right

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830
side we have the origins or

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.290
sources of funding.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.230
And here what is we have to understand?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.030
Well, we have to understand that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.410
the liabilities or foreign

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.290
funds have a risk, because you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690
have to return them, and if you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.970
can’t return it you’ll go bankrupt.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.390
They have a risk and have a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.590
cost, because you have to pay interest.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.510
In the case of own funds, it is not

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.790
so, because they do not pose any

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.030
risk to the company.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.430
The risk is assumed by the partners,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.730
who invest their money and take

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.250
the risk of not recovering it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.770
or not getting the profitability

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.910
they expect, etc.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.170
In addition, own funds do not have

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.770
direct cost to the company,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.490
because you do not have the contractual

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.150
obligation to remunerate

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.590
the partners.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.730
If so, dividends are paid,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390
but they are not like interest.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.390
Well, the ratio between one and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.250
the other is what is called the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.630
leverage ratio or the indebtedness

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.490
ratio, which is something you

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.290
have to be very familiar

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.570
with, because it has a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.350
huge impact on the company’

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.310
s risk, valuation, profitability,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.490
etc.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.230
We will see it later.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.840
We should understand what kind of

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.660
financing we should resort to depending

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.560
on the assets of a company.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.580
That is, it is that of course, it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.680
has nothing to do with having

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.460
a company in which assets, for example,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.080
are very liquid.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.860
Imagine there are stocks in which

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.840
you have a company in which, almost

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.560
if your assets are, for example,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.920
immovated, non-current assets.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.800
Well, it is very easy to understand this.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.460
If we have assets, how do we finance

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.900
assets that are not current,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.520
that are not liquid, that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.500
will not be converted

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.440
into treasury.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.960
Well, then in principle, I say in

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.720
principle because here we have

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.940
to make matches, but we will now

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.120
just stay with the idea.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.120
You have to finance them

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.180
either with permanent resources

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.100
or with own funds or with

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.860
long-term debts.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.500
Why is?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.140
Because those assets will not be converted

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.540
into treasury that will allow

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.280
you to repay those debts.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.900
Stay with this concept.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080
With current assets,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.520
we could do a similar

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.340
analysis.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.640
If current assets are liquid and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.500
will be converted into treasury,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.720
we could finance them

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.960
with short-term liabilities,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.320
right?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.600
They will be able to make

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.100
money to repay those debts.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.120
But in this analysis, there

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.540
are other factors that need

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.860
to be included, right?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.660
What are the operational

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.200
funding needs we will see.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.140
We need to look at the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.840
funding needs of

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.660
a company.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.440
So how much do we have to finance?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.840
Well, let’s start with the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.780
asset, because what you have to

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.960
finance is the asset.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.300
We have a non-current asset,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.400
which is fixed, immovilized assets.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.820
We also need to add current

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.860
assets.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.200
And in this case we will think only of

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.500
the operative ones, which are

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.940
necessary for the activity.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.160
Let us put, for example,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.580
stocks and customers.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.720
Well, that’s all we

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.860
should finance, right?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.280
Well, here you have to consider

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.640
a very important concept, which

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.700
is spontaneous financing, which

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.420
are the providers.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.900
Because suppliers help us to

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.840
finance part of our activity.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.400
You think, imagine you have a trade

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.300
where you don’t have fixed

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.280
assets.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.700
You only have to fund the

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.820
stocks, the purchases.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.600
You do not have any other assets.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.140
You sell at the expense,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.660
but pay your suppliers

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.020
90 days.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.820
Well, it’s that your suppliers,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.160
in this case, are helping you

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.940
to finance your entire activity.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.700
You do not have to put money

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.540
in advance.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.720
You sell at the counter and pay the

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.320
supplier 90 days.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.760
Well, from this, what we calculate

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.440
are operational fund needs

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.040
or working capital, which

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.760
are absolutely basic

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.060
concepts in finance.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.940
How is it calculated?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.480
Well, because we have current

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.700
assets less current operating

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.120
liabilities, less suppliers,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.400
basically.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.060
The NOF is the amount

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.320
we really have to finance, because

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.960
the rest helps us to

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.080
finance suppliers.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.640
So, let’s think about what is

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.060
the total amount that a company

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.840
has to finance?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.540
The total financial needs

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.240
we have here in red.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.900
Well, because it is the non-current

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.720
assets plus the operational

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720
needs of funds.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.100
So the later you pay your suppliers,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.560
the higher the balance of suppliers,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.440
the better because our overall

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.640
financial needs will

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.600
be better, they will

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.320
be lower.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.660
Let’s go to a case where NOFs are

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.600
negative.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.860
That is, suppliers help us

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.280
to finance all our operational

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.940
activity, not only that, but

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.020
above all help us to finance

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.560
part of our non-current

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.620
assets, as we can see

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.860
on the screen.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.260
Well, because that’s what it

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.260
does, as we’ve seen, decrease

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.960
the total financial needs, which

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.180
is much better because we have

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.400
to put the partners less money,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.760
you have to resort to a lower

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.240
amount of liabilities,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.180
debt, etc.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.700
Why is?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.660
Because it’s the providers

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.940
who are helping you

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.620
finance.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.200
Regarding the state of results

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.700
or results, what you need

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.780
to know, yes or yes, is what

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.720
are the main magnitudes

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.460
and what they inform us.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.300
We start with the gross margin,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.580
which we do is deduct

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.160
only the cost of sales.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.160
And here this is always thought

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.040
of any business, it is not

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.180
a high-margin or low-margin

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.080
business.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.260
Then we are going to rest the personnel

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.320
expenses, other operating

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.380
expenses, etc., and we come to

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.600
levy, which is the depreciation

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.860
and amortisation tax, which is

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.320
a very well-known size.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.580
If we take away the amortization

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.260
and depreciation we get to levitt.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.540
Well, what I want to happen here

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.460
is that Levittda and Levitt are

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.060
usually considered the most representative

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.600
magnitudes of operating profit,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.500
of economic profit.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.160
What do we mean by economic operations?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.740
Well, we are not taking into account

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.040
how we have been financed, we are

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.360
only taking into account the operational

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.680
activity of the company itself

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.700
and this helps us in many

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.480
cases to compare different

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.440
companies.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.920
Why is?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.000
Because how you have funded

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.420
you responds to other kinds of decisions

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.660
and when we consider the operational

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.340
economic benefit good because

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.180
what we are analyzing

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.160
is only the activity itself of

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.920
the company.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.800
Then we go down and we take away

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.980
interest on debts and we have

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.680
the gross profit and then we take

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.900
away the taxes, which also taxes

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.260
because you have in mind that

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.840
they depend on each country, taxation,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.420
etc., and we get to the result

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.540
of the exercise.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.000
Depending on the information we

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.120
want to obtain, if we want

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.640
to compare companies in different

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.960
countries, etc., we will

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.480
use one size or another.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.290
It is important that you understand

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.750
well how a company’s profitability

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.510
is calculated and is

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.690
mainly done using two sizes

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.710
that are the ROA and the ROA.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.390
ROA is economic profitability

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.550
and we call it economic because

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.810
it is the profitability on the asset.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.930
As you said economic refers to that

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.890
we only measure the activity of the

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.210
company if we do not have in mind how

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.850
it is funded and the ROA is equal to

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.750
the net profit part by the total asset

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.350
and subsequently we have

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.250
the financial profitability,

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.890
the profitability over the own

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.030
funds, the profitability over

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.010
the equity that is the ROE, which

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.930
is the magnitude that matters to

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.170
the partners and how it is calculated

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.450
because very easy also the net

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.330
profit in this case we divide it

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.830
between the equity and what is

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.050
interesting here is that you

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.570
know what the relationship

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.270
between the two is.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.610
Well, ROE depends mainly

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.910
on two things.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.390
It depends on the profitability we

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.750
get on the asset, that is, on the

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.090
economic activity itself, on whether

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.310
we are better or worse, whether

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.450
we are more profitable or less

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.310
in the use of our assets, and

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.090
also on how we have been financed.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.010
It depends on leverage.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.630
Basically, as long as the profitability

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.870
on the asset is higher than

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.890
the cost of debt, the more you

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.850
have leveraged, the more

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.590
you have borrowed, the greater

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.570
your profitability, the

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.890
profitability of your own

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.210
funds, because you have

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.270
put less money.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.970
We always understand this well

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.330
when we put the example with a housing.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.570
You buy a house and you mortgage

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.470
at the maximum, imagine a lot

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.070
of money and the price of the house

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.350
results in a year, two years,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.470
whatever, and you have obtained

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.450
a plus value of 100,000 euros,

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.690
for example, and you still put

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.790
very little money.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.810
The profitability of that money

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.590
you put on your own funds

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.250
is very high.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:18.950
Why is?

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.690
Because of the leverage, thanks

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.850
to the financing that has allowed

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.470
you to make an investment

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.610
in an asset with a value,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.270
but putting very little money.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.590
Therefore, ROE depends on the profitability

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.410
on assets and how we have

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.830
funded ourselves.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.130
It is interesting to understand what

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.430
the rotation of assets consists

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.670
of and how it affects profitability.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.630
If we see the definition,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.290
the rotation of an asset is the

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.010
number of times in a period that

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.150
that asset becomes sales.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.610
We could do so with the entire

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.790
asset or we could do so, for

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.950
example, with specific items

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.610
such as stocks, which are the

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.490
assets that are constantly rotating.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.690
What is what happens?

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.390
The higher the turnover, the

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.930
same amount of assets generates

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.210
more sales or, seen from another

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.230
perspective, for the same volume

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.290
of sales you would

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.690
need to finance less

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.850
asset volume.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.030
What I want you to understand is that

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.110
the higher the rotation, the higher

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.410
the profitability because

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.170
we need less assets, as we

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.930
were seeing.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.970
This affects the ROE on the

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.330
profitability of the asset.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.730
In this formula, we see it.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.310
If the profitability on the asset is

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.610
equal to the net profit taken by the

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.570
asset, if the rotation is greater

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.270
and we need fewer assets, because the

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.790
profitability is greater, right?

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.330
And here, look, we have it more disaggregated.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.590
The ROE is equal to the margin

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.030
you get for every euro you sell.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.630
How much is net profit?

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.510
The more margin the more

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.910
profitability, obvious.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.270
And, in addition, it depends on the rotation

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.070
because the higher the rotation

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.510
you will need a smaller amount

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.430
of assets.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.020
Cash flow is the amount

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.380
of cash flow that has

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.880
been generated in a business,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.980
in a company, in an investment

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.180
over a period of time.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.740
There is a difference

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.780
between net profit and

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.600
cash flow.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.500
Net profit is calculated

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.960
income minus expenses, but what

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.260
you have to keep in mind is that

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.240
income and expenses are

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.120
purely accountable sizes, not

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.180
objective sizes.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.340
What do I mean by this?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.700
It depends on the rules

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.140
of each country, how you apply

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.880
them, etc.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.720
You can periodize income,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.900
periodize expenses, amortise

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.780
more, less, etc.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.820
Instead, cash flow is totally

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.120
objective, it is the treasury

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.700
it has been able to generate.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.480
We also need to know what the most

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.740
popular cash flows are and how they

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.840
are calculated.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.700
In the world of finance, there

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.240
are basically two sizes of cash flow,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.660
mainly, which is the free cash

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.720
flow, which is the free cash flow,

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.020
and the cash flow of the shareholders.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.010
Let’s see how it is calculated.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.230
We start from the magnitude

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.610
of profit related, which I will not

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.650
explain here in detail, but basically

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.910
we start from the profit

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.630
and what we do is adjustments.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.630
The first thing we do is adjust

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.710
it with lots that have been taken

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.250
into account to calculate the

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.930
profit, but that really don’t

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.930
affect the box.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.470
The most obvious example is

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.710
the amortisation.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.530
You when you amortise is a cost

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.530
on the result account, but

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.830
really the amortisation is

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.430
not a cash out.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.890
We must start with the

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.970
profit and add the amortisations.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.770
We also have to pay for the

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.350
investments we have made over

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.670
a period of time, over

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.450
a year.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.790
If you make investments,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.750
those investments are not

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.230
included in the income account.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.390
They are assets you have acquired

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.670
or have increased whatever.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.250
Well, because those investments

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.850
do what you have less treasure.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.110
You have devoted treasury to making investments.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.630
They are usually divided between

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.910
investment in circulating capital,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.310
working capital, operational

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.630
fund needs, i.e. more operational

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.930
needs, and investment

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.310
in fixed assets in capex.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.050
We have the free cash flow

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.570
and the free cash flow.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.190
The free cash flow is the

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.810
cash flow generated by the company

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.810
without considering how we have

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.170
funded ourselves.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.790
That is, until now we have not

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.370
taken into account the entries

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.870
or exits of debt, we have not taken

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.950
into account interest, etc.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.930
Well, if we want to calculate,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.870
make the final cash flow that

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.710
remains for shareholders, what

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.970
we have to do is start with

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.210
the free cash flow, add the

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.130
debt entries if we have

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.650
received debt, restate the

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.950
debt amortisations and also

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.830
restate the interests we had

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.970
to pay for those debt.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.190
The only thing that remains is the

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.630
cash flow of the shareholders.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.120
You should understand very well what

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.300
it consists of and how capitalization

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.500
or discounting and updating

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500
of cash flows is done.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.140
We start with capitalization.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.120
Capital is to carry a cash flow to the

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.780
future, that is, to calculate how much

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.840
it is worth in the future.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:23.980
And how do we do it?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.960
In this case, what we do is multiply

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.820
by a capitalization factor

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.880
that depends on the type of

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.520
interest we expect to generate

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.660
that investment.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.460
The opposite is done with capitalization

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.360
or with discount.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.040
What we do is calculate how much

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.760
cash flows are worth today that

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.340
are predictable in the future.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.700
In this case, we do

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.900
not multiply, in this case

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.980
we do divide by a discount

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.140
factor.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.860
We apply a discount rate.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.160
What you have to understand is that

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.680
the discount rate depends on the

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.280
expected risk in that investment.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.660
We also saw that we can disagree

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.760
this way, it depends on the interest

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.800
without risk, which is the cost of

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800
opportunity, and it depends on the

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.020
risk premium you estimate or apply

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.680
to that investment, to that particular

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.460
company.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.390
This is the basis

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.610
of cash flow.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.250
In this case, when we discount cash

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.490
flows, what we have is a series

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.730
of future cash flows and we

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.390
will discount them and bring them

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.550
to the current moment by applying

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.950
a rate that, as we have seen,

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.310
depends on the required

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.370
profitability.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.990
If we perceive that it has a lot

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.530
of risk, we demand a higher profitability,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.950
we apply a higher rate, because

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.670
the current value of all those funds

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.290
will be lower.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.820
It is important that you understand

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.540
well how a company is valued, what

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.160
are the main methods and more.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.320
Well, basically we could say that there

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.240
are three approaches.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.940
The first is to estimate the value

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.380
of a company from the value of

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.380
its assets.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.700
Within this approach there

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.660
are different methods, we can

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.940
do it in different ways, but we

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.440
will not go into detail now.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.980
The second would be to estimate the

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.660
value of a company based on

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.040
the market value of other transactions

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.640
that have been generated or

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.260
what companies listed in

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.020
the sector are worth, etc.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.320
That is, we look at how much companies

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.080
are worth that are comparable

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.480
and we get some conclusions and

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.320
apply it to ours.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.320
This is done with the multiple,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.060
with the comparable multiple.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.680
There are some that are well known, such

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.640
as EBITDA, for example, or as the

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.900
PERC, which is the Price Earning

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.420
Ratio.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.960
For example, imagine that in similar

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.520
transactions of companies

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.200
like yours, in your sector,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.680
etc., the transaction has been

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.500
valued at an EBITDA of 7.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.900
Well, you will do what you will do

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.140
is apply that multiple to your

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.180
company and you will get the value

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.060
of your company.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.200
It is very easy to do.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.440
The last of the methods and the

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.000
most orthodox we have is cash

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.340
flows.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.880
In this case, what we do is analyze

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.040
the company and project

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.060
the cash flows that we expect

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.340
that company will generate

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.980
in the coming years.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.680
And then we discount those cash

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.440
flows, bring them to the current

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.940
moment, applying it to a

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.800
discount rate.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.500
This discount rate depends on the risk.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.300
It is not the same thing that

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.780
we are valuing, imagine, a startup

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.180
with a very high degree of

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.240
innovation and very high risk that

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.240
we are valuing an investment

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.740
because that is very stable in

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.900
which we know almost to science

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.640
what will happen and more.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.000
So we project cash flows

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.120
with expectations, etc.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.440
We discount them using a discount

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.720
rate that is representative

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.640
of the risk.
