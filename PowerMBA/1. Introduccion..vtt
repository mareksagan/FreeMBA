00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.010
The goal of this class is to understand

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.390
digital marketing from an

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.210
integral perspective, to

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.830
understand how all the pieces

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.930
fit.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.970
By the way, I advance you that

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.410
there will be concepts that come

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.450
out in today’s class that you may

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.610
not know, but that we will

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.770
develop in the next classes.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.250
Today, what we’re going to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.830
do is share with you a model we’

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.890
ve created, a model that allows

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.430
us to create a marketing

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.850
plan or that allows us to

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.450
manage a company’s digital marketing.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.950


00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.690
This model is made up of four

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.970
factors that we have on screen.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.870
We start with the funnel or customer

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.690
journey.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.230
We will set goals for each of

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.670
the stages of the funnel, in addition

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.510
we will identify which are the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.830
tools or the appropriate channels

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.650
to those goals and finally

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.390
what we have to do is to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.430
have very clear what are

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.990
all the metrics along

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.390
the funnel to be able

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.030
to permanently optimize them.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.230
Well, let us start.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
The first of the aspects, the first

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.710
of the blocks from which everything

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.650
is born, is the customer.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.270
We always say that the most important

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.710
competition for any marketing

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.830
expert is to understand the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.630
customer well, systematically

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.070
trying to understand

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.230
what is what moves the customer.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.990
In this particular case, in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570
digital marketing, what we have to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.010
do is understand very well what

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.570
are the phases or stages through which

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.210
a customer goes through in the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.170
process of buying.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.670
Here are some models that give names

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.890
to these stages.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.850
For example, this is the most known.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.430
Knowledge, consideration, evaluation,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.570
purchase, recommendation

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.430
Well, I think it helps you understand

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.550
a little about what we’re talking

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.870
about, but you don’t have to memorize it.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.530
What you have to do is draw or

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.070
identify what the specific

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.770
steps are for your case.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.810
Imagine that we have an e-

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.650
commerce of glasses, of sunglasses,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.390
for example.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.290
What would those stages be within

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.810
the funnel?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.270
Well, the first thing is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.710
that we impact our target

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.370
audience through many

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.790
channels, for example, through

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.170
social media ads.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.430
And then we get a percentage

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.830
of those people visit

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.690
our website.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.930
And some do it is to browse the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
website and enter the detail

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.410
of some of the glasses.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.850
Compare with other models, for example.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.190
And a percentage of those what

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.710
they do is add it to the shopping

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.530
cart and some end up buying.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.310
It is important that you identify what

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.930
the phases are and it is vital

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.810
that you understand in each of the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.610
phases what the customer wants, what

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.970
is what concerns him, how he

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.690
acts, etc.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.890
There are many pseudo-experts

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.410
in marketing, digital marketing who

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.170
are experts in some of the channels,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.710
etc., who are experts equally in

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.910
analytics, but do not understand

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.190
the customer.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.630
And since they have not made the effort

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.910
to understand the customer, to know

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.550
what moves them, the results are

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.530
half as always.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.990
If you really know your customer

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.270
well, if you know what moves them,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.070
everything else will be very easy

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.630
for you.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.430
You are sure to sell a lot, you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.030
are sure to earn a lot of money.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.490
Well, what we’re going to do is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.550
structure the entire plan from

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.370
those stages, the next

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.490
thing we have to do is define

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.630
very clear goals or strategies

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.070
for each of those stages.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.270
And in digital marketing the reality

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.890
is that we can define common

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.730
goals that apply to almost

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.750
every funnel.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.690
You will understand well.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.510
At the top of the funnel, what we

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.870
always have to do all the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.910
companies in the world is to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.710
attract visitors or attract

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.930
for example facilities in our app.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.030
It is to put gasoline in the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.850
top of the funnel.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.910
Later on, we have to get

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.650
those visits to become customers.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.370
Then what we have to do is that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.650
those customers who have already

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.190
bought us or buy us more,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.870
products of more value, or buy

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.270
us more recurrently and get

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.090
to have loyal customers.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.790
And finally we incorporate an additional

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.130
phase in the funnel, in the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.830
lower, expansive part.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.590
Why is?

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.650
Because we have to get our

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.470
clients recommend us to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.210
become promoters, prescribers,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.110
etc.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.910
This will create additional business.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.410
Well, this second section, this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.830
second factor that are the objectives

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.090
is very important to have very

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.790
clear and manage very clearly the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.610
different objectives by assigning

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.350
different responsible within

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.930
the organization, measuring

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.730
it with metrics or with

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.430
specific indicators,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.570
using appropriate tools, etc.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.270
There are many companies that have a

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.070
mess in this, that have not defined

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.430
the plan so and in the end what

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.470
they have is different agent

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.110
pursuing in many cases

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.230
different goals.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.450
Well, we really recommend

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.910
that you identify what all

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.130
the stages within the funnel

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.030
are and define the very clear

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.110
goals for each of those stages.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.410
When we have the tools,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.610
the channels, the tactics,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.850
whatever, as you want

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.470
to call it, that allow us

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.670
to those goals.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.410
And what are they?

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.310
They are very many.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.190
So what we have to do is in

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.230
the next classes you know them.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.810
What are the tools or channels

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.890
to attract visitors, to convert

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.810
visitors into customers, etc.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.250
You have to know them all, understand

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.330
them and know what their pros, their

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.790
disadvantages, etc. are.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.590
Now, let’s go to the last factor,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.570
and that is optimization.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.450
Here I want to make an incisive.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.530
If you go to books or the orthodox

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.050
theory of digital marketing

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.490
or marketing plans in general, you

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.230
are sure that what they propose

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.630
is that you define a number of

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.430
goals or quantitative goals.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.740
Imagine increasing the conversion

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.300
ratio over the ID from 10 to 15%.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.640
Well, I tell you that it is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.400
not true, that it is not

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.460
how we act companies.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.800
It is not so.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.860
What we do companies are measure

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.900
everything we can and try to

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.020
optimize permanently.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.840
That is, it is not that we want to go from

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.260
12 to 15 percent and this year we mark

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.620
ourselves that goal, no.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.400
What we do is permanently that

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.440
12 and try to be 13, that is 14,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.980
that is 15, and when it is 15,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.160
we want to be 16.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.360
What is the key here?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.440
The key is to identify which

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.760
are all the metrics we’re going

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.180
to measure.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.080
We have proposed you, we have

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.200
classified the metrics in three blocks.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.800
On the one hand, the indicators,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.180
which are, look at, at the top

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.440
of the funnel are basically

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.220
visits or facilities, for example.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.240
Then we will do a deeper detail,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.440
for example, we can sort the

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.080
visits according to the different

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.780
origins of those that come, whether

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.860
we have paid for them or

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.660
not, etc., we will see.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.360
But the main indicator at this

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.560
level are visits and we are going

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.060
down and we have leads, which

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.280
do not always apply, but in many

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.080
cases we have the indicator of

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.460
leads.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.040
Below what we’re going to measure is,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.600
well, because the new customers

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.320
we capture or the operations

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.680
that are generated, the sales,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.740
the number of sales, we continue

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.200
to drop and we can measure the

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.620
number of recurring customers

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.480
we have or the recurrence the

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.020
times that each customer buys, etc.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.020
And an absolutely vital perspective

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.820
are conversion ratios.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.720
As we go down the funnel,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.740
as we go down from visits,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.200
leads, customers, etc., we

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.560
have to be constantly

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.800
measuring what conversion

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.540
rates are for each of the

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.340
levels and why this is

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.540
very important.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.820
First, because these conversion

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.820
ratios are representative of

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.300
how we are doing things.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.920
If we improve, that percentage

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.260
will increase.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.500
If we improve messages on the

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.680
website, we will increase

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.200
the percentage of people who leave

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.300
us the data on the website,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300
for example.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.960
Or if we improve the experience of

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.440
using it on the web, we will that

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.880
there are more people to buy.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.420
We have to be obsessed with those

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.980
conversion ratios that have

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.920
a direct impact on what customers

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.280
will cost us, the number

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.420
of customers we will capture,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.000
etc.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.780
And it’s also very easy to

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.580
manage the ratio, because what

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.260
we have to do is permanently

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.920
optimize it.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.600
Instead, absolute values are harder

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.480
to manage, because we don’t

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.120
have 100 leads now and we’ll

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.260
have 120 tomorrow.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.280
Well, it’s okay, but the important

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.940
thing is to know the percentage

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.000
of visits that become leads

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.400
and to permanently monitor

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.600
that data.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.840
The last one

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.040
is the most economic.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.760
It is to allocate costs or revenue

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.520
to each of the stages.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.840
What are the costs?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.120
Because we can calculate the total

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.940
investment, we can calculate what

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.900
it costs us, because what visits

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.000
cost us, what leads cost us,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.580
what each of the purchases

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.840
cost us and we also have to

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.860
be able to measure what are

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.320
the revenues that each of

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.540
the customers is generating

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.820
to us, etc.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.500
Let us take a look.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.320
Four factors within the model.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.500
The first of them is that you

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.660
understand the customer very well

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.800
and understand the phases through

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.440
which it goes and what moves him.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.860
This is the most important of all.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.040
As we said in the funnel,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.400
then we go to the goals.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.880
Clear goals for each of the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.220
stages of the funnel.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.460
We will then put in place

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.780
the tools, the channels

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.320
to those goals and

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.700
finally we have to permanently

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.420
monitor the

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.960
main metrics along

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.160
the entire funnel.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.940
With what purpose?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.620
The goal is to always optimize.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.900
Because if you are not able to measure

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.520
it you will not be able to manage

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.040
it and for this we will need to

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.860
understand analytics, have

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.800
systems that allow us to measure, etc.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.320
We will see it in the next classes.
