00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.430
Competitive advantage is one

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.170
of the key and basic concepts

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.210
of business strategy.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.150
It is also very easy to understand.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.730
What is a competitive advantage?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.150
Well, because it’s a feature that

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.910
allows you to get some better

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.030
results than the rest.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.290
It puts you ahead of others,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.490
right?

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.210
It is a very broad concept, it is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.050
a concept that can be used in the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.470
business world, it can be used

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.770
at a personal level, it can be

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.510
considered that there are countries

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.730
that have competitive advantages

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.330
over others, right?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.570
And speaking of the business world,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.530
because the competitive advantages are innumerable.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.690
I will give you a few examples,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.850
just to illustrate it,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.910
so you can get a little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.590
idea.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.510
You can have like Harvard, for example,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.950
a very powerful brand that allows

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.910
you, in this case, to make any program

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.010
you launch to the market, well,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.410
because it is a guaranteed success.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.350
Or you may have, in the case of Apple,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.310
it is very similar.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.910
In addition to the brand, it has

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.090
millions of users with a great loyalty

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.190
who absolutely trust Apple,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.790
which allows it to make products,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.450
other products, a success.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.810
This is a clear competitive advantage.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.710
Or, for example, if you have

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.670
the restaurant with the best

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.650
location in the city, with views

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.050
like those we have on screen,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.210
because it is clear that it is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.290
a competitive advantage.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.530
Or if you are able to offer a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.010
superior customer experience at

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.130
the point of sale.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.750
And in the end, customers choose you for

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.050
that.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.770
Competitive advantages can also

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950
come from operations, from

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.370
internal operations.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.050
If you are able, as in the case

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.490
of Inditex, that since you identify

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
a trend, design that product, make

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.550
the designs, create the product

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.590
and the finished product is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.870
in the points of sale around

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.090
the world and has passed

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.150
a record time, as we will

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.130
analyze later, because it is a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.250
competitive advantage.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.590
The case of Amazon.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.050
Amazon has many competitive advantages,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.610
but one of them is that it already

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.090
has millions and millions of people

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.910
around the world who are accustomed,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.170
who have already paid with

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.430
card, that their data is recorded

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.190
within the marketplace

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.490
and absolutely faithful.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.810
Any new product that Amazon launches,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.850
it’s very easy to grow like that.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.870
As I said, it has very competitive

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.950
advantages because the logistics

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.870
network that allows you to buy

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.130
and tomorrow you get the product,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.830
because it is very competitive

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.510
advantage.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.030
It can also come from people.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
If you have the best talent, if

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.230
you have the best managers, or if

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.610
you are a restaurant and you have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.750
the best cooks, or in the case

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.750
of football, then it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.510
is clear too.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.970
This is something that puts you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.570
ahead of your competitors.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.730
Well, as we have seen, competitive

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.810
advantage is a very simple concept

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.010
that already ensures you make

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.630
the idea.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.470
What we’re going to do now is let’

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.330
s define three criteria to consider

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.850
whether something is a competitive

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.210
advantage or not, right?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.470
They are mainly three and it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.390
is the first one you are able to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.510
put in value, that is, to get

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690
a performance of that advantage

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.330
you have or that feature.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.210
You will understand it with an example.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.310
If you are the smartest student

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.510
in your class but you suspend

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.850
everything because you don’t study,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.230
because despite having a competition,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.450
a ability, well, because in this

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.890
case you don’t get any performance,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.050
therefore it’s not a competitive

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.030
advantage.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.750
In the case of companies you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.830
have to convert, you have to move

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.770
into that you are able to earn

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.010
market share by stealing customers

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.210
from your competitors, to grow

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.030
more than others or to get

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.150
higher returns, higher profitabilities,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.870
forgiveness.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.010
In this case, it is a competitive advantage.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.630
It has to be sustainable,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.110
it has to be sustainable.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.590


00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.730
The competitive advantage you

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.530
have created must allow you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.950
to that performance over a period

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.890
of time.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.730
If we talked about Harvard,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.430
for example, it is clear that

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.810
this brand will allow you to

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.110
sell programs with high

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.450
profitability and being a market

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.390
success for many years.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.990
And it has to be hard to imitate

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.090
because if what you have can easily

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.470
be copied by anyone, it

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.270
obviously ceases to be a competitive

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.310
advantage.
