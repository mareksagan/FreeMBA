00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.980
I always say that the value curve

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.400
is an exceptional tool because

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.460
it helps us visualize very intuitively

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.120
how the value proposition,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.120
the competitive proposal

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.860
of the different segments, is.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.020
And it also helps us to analyze

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.860
what others do, analyze what

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.260
your value proposal is, to look

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.180
for innovations, to look for

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.820
your gap in the market, etc.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.240
Today we will do as we asked

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.420
you, with the restoration sector.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.120
I think it's easy because it'

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.700
s a sector we're all customers of.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.100
And what we will do is visualize

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.540
through the value curve how

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.120
the proposal of the different

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.480
segments within the offer is.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.940
Of the top restaurants, which

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.060
have for example Michelin

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.820
stars, of the luxury restaurants

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.360
or Prime, of the day menu restaurants,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.260
of the low cost chains,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.280
etc.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.100
What we'll see is what factors

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.640
they invest in and how they seek their

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.420
differentiation.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.220
Well, the first thing I've asked

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.200
you is let's identify the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.420
competitive factors, that is,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.340
those factors in which restaurants

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.760
are almost all investing

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.140
to offer a greater value to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.040
their customers.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.860
I hope my analysis is in close

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.140
agreement with yours.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800
The price has to be included because

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
it is always one of the competitive

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.740
factors.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.240
In the case of restaurants, location

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120
is very important.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.440
If you are located in a better area

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.360
within the city, you can charge

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.500
more, it will offer more value, clearly.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.380
The quality of food, sophistication,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.460
personal service, all restaurants

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.860
invest in having waiters

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.620
and people of attention to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.240
the public that offer a greater

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.060
value to their customers.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.560
It is one of the main investment

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
steps and one of the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.300
main determinants of perceived

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.120
value.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.840
The chef, especially

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.160
in the most valuable restaurants,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.080
the chef is something

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.580
now needed.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.280
Invest in recognized figures.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.180
The environment, the decoration, be

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.720
beautiful, be pleasant, etc.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.920
The environment and the environment

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200
are all about the public, the rest

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.580
of the customers.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.880
When you go to a restaurant you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.560
expect, depending on the type of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000
restaurant it is, you expect a different

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.440
atmosphere.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.280
The Marker.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.560
Restaurants invest in brand,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.160
invest like all kinds of

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.920
companies.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.660
And how do they do it?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.220
The most valuable do so through

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.540
certifications, such as Michelin

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.460
Stras, but they are all present

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.040
on networks like TripAdvisor,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.920
invest in having a presence

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
on social networks,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.780
etc.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.740
A brand is a common denominator in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.060
which everyone in one way or another

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.620
invests.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.260
The convenience.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.380
By convenience I am referring

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.880
to the proximity to where

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.060
you are, speed, comfort, etc.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.680
It is easy to get to this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.080
restaurant.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.220
This is a very important factor that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.380
many of you may not have included

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.700
in the analysis of competitive

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.720
factors.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.200
And finally, I have included the number

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.980
of points of sale, because depending

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740
on whether we are talking about

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.720
chains or individual restaurants,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200
well, because here the difference

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.220
is between them or not.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.540
Well, I think these are the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.940
main competitive factors around

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.320
which competition revolves,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.700
or that we could say more

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.220
if we would later identify

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980
some more.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.660
Some more associated with particular

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600
proposals from private restaurants.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.600
But this would be common to everyone, right?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.800
I think you will be with me.
