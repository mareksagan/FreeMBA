WEBVTT

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.640
The background of manoeuvre is one

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.120
of the key concepts in accounting

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.440
and finance, which you have probably

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.680
heard thousands of times.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.140
But you may not understand

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.780
it well yet.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.660
So we'll do a class on that.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.960
First, in the previous class we

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.160
have seen how assets should

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.700
be financed according to whether

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.220
they are non-current or current.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.000
But remember that non-current

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.160
assets, fixed assets, should

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.080
be financed with permanent

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.440
resources because they are

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.460
assets that are little liquid

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.940
and that will not generate the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.460
treasury needed to meet

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.960
debt payments.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.460
And in the case of current

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.880
assets, they can be financed

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.200
with current liabilities because

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.520
they are liquid assets that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.380
generate treasury and allow

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.900
us to pay our short-

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
term debts.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.520
By the way, if you don't understand

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.660
this I'm telling you right, you

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.140
should see the previous class again.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.880
It is important.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.780
Now, let's go to the subject.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.660
Imagine we have such a company.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.240
We have a business in which

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.480
non-current assets were financed

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
by permanent assets

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.160
and current assets

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.360
by current liabilities.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.580
As you can see, the games are

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.240
exactly the same.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.800
This situation, based on what we

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.000
have seen in the previous class,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.880
is a correct situation.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
That is, we are theoretically

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.500
fulfilling the precepts we have

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.580
seen.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.420
We will have current

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.940
assets, they will generate

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.620
fair and sufficient liquidity

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.120
to meet short-term debt.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.400
I want to be fair and fair because

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300
there is no room for error.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.240
There is no margin of error.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020
If any unforeseen event occurs,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.580
we will not have liquidity

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.780
to meet short-term debt.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.100
Back to the balance.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.840
As we have seen, there is no room for error.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.740
We have the fair and necessary

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.280
amount of current assets to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.380
repay the debts.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.740
How can we increase that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.480
margin of manoeuvre?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940
How can we do this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.280
to be more secure?

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.840
I will do this by pulling

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.720
the permanent resource.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.140
If we increase the share of permanent

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.180
resources in this situation,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.300
the risk is less because here

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.860
we already have a backdrop,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.560
we have a margin of manoeuvre.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.060
The liquidity that will generate

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940
current assets is more than

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.100
enough to repay short-

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.960
term debt.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.220
And as this part of permanent resources

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.880
grows, our margin will be

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.000
greater, our security

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.980
will be greater.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.980
Do you understand?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.600
We have gone from a situation like this,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.060
where there was no basis for

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.640
manoeuvre, where we have the just

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.140
and necessary liquidity, to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.380
situations where we have greater

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.020
security.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.960
If we go to this situation,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.560
what would it be?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.760
The maximum security.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.320
We have long-term debt.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.560
We will have no problem.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.180
I'm sure you already understand the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.020
logic and the concept.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.860
Now let's go to the definitions

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.740
and let's go to the formula.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.140
We can explain it in two ways.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.420
The fund of manoeuvre is the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.020
surplus of the permanent

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.680
resources, what we have left

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.020
of the permanent resources, after

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.380
financing the fixed assets,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.000
the non-current assets, and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.580
which we use to finance

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.040
short-term operations.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.740
Well, it looks a bit complicated.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.840
Permanent resources, if we increase

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.160
them, we have a surplus

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.900
of permanent resources

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.840
over non-current assets,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.420
which allows us to

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.940
finance current assets.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.840
and Visto?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.860
The formula would be this.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.420
We are left with the total of permanent

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.360
resources, we are left with the non-

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.920
current assets and we are left with

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.780
the backdrop.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.690
Well, there is another way to explain it.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.610
There is another perspective that is

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.310
the same, but seen from a different perspective.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.610
And in this case the fund of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.050
manoeuvre would be equal to the amount

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.030
of current assets that we

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.730
finance with permanent resources.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.350
Instead of starting the definition

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.750
with the passive, we start with the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.910
asset, but it is the same.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.390
What is the formula?

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.370
Current assets are less current passives.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.460
Let us see it all with an example.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.860
Let us think that we are

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.120
mounting an antique e-commerce,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.720
that is, we are going to sell

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.660
the antique fund through the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.300
internet.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.520
We have a total asset worth

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.980
$50,000.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.780
$30,000 are non-current assets,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.300
they are fixed assets, in this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.760
case it is the website.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.220
And the non-current asset is the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.960
commodity, it is the first batch

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.260
of antiques we will buy.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.800
We have to fund all the stock.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.240
How can we finance it?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.240
Let us see.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.320
Well, one option is that the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.500
partners contribute the total

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.240
asset, the $50,000.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.960
In this case, we will finance

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.300
with permanent resources, as

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.580
we see here, the whole.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.380
So what is the background of manoeuvre?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.920
The current fund is $20,000,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.160
which is equal to the entire

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.020
current asset.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.740
Let us now look at an example.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.500
We are planning to build

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.700
an antique e-commerce.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.140
The business is very simple, we

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.420
will sell antiques through the

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.020
internet.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.160
The total asset is $50,000.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.080
We have a website worth $30,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.220
000, it's a non-current asset.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.920
And we have goods, which is the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.240
first package of antiques we will

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.060
buy for a value of 20,000.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.340
Let us now see how to finance

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.220
ourselves and according to how, from

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.100
our financial structure, we will

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.120
calculate the fund of manoeuvre.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.100
The first option.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.640
Options with less risk.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.120
The partners donated $50,000.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.080
Obviously a business that has no

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.280
debt, because it has no risk.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.780
At least, there is no

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.800
financial risk.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.680
In this case, the maneuver

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.180
fund has a sum of $20,000.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.330
Option of 2.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.070
The partners don't have $50,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.790
000, we have $10,000,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.770
but we have a long-term

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.330
loan worth $40,000.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.110
The fund remains the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.670
same, remaining $20,000.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.250
If we drop the permanent

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.650
assets minus the non-current

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.750
assets, we get an amount

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.090
of $20,000.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.930
Here the risk is also very

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.930
low, because we have permanent

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.890
resources to finance

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.290
the entire asset.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.690
We see you in a third case.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.190
There is no ground for manoeuvre.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.570
The partners have $10,000,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.910
as we saw, and we get debt.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.190
However, we do not get the

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.310
full long-term debt, as

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.430
we have seen in the previous

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.430
case, but we have a long-

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.530
term debt worth $20,000,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.290
but during the first 12 months

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.790
we will have to face the

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.350
repayment of these

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.430
20,000.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.270
What happens is that we

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.430
have goods worth $20,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.330
000 here, so we

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.730
are in a situation

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.350
where there is no risk.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.850
The problem is that there is no ground for manoeuvre.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.770
And we go to the last case, in the

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.650
case of the negative fund of manoeuvre.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.170
It turns out that banks do

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.710
not grant long-term financing,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.950
so we have to resort to

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.270
other mechanisms.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.830
And during the first year we

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.130
will have to pay payments

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.370
worth $40,000.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.850
As you can see here, I put it in red because

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.290
the background of manoeuvre is negative.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.290
We are in a risky situation,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.750
in theory.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.530
Why is?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.090
I think we have funded the

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.390
website, these 30,000 euros.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.370
We have largely funded

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.230
them with a loan we have to

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.050
repay within 12 months, which

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.790
is theoretically incorrect.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.470
I hope you understand the functioning

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.410
of the manoeuvre fund

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.750
and the analysis that we

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.990
can do from it.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.130
I also tell you that interpretation

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.290
is not so simple, it is not

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.210
mathematical.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.010
In this case 2 plus 2 are not

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.770
4 because there may be other

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.030
variables that influence.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.350
I will just give it as an

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.010
example.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.030
If during the first year we are

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.310
able to buy and sell these goods

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.190
worth 20,000 euros, buy and sell

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.530
and make them rot many times

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.450
in 12 months, it is possible

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.070
that we are able to generate

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.430
the liquidity needed

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.070
to return these short-

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.690
term debts.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.490
It is an example of why the background

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.250
of manoeuvre we cannot take

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.330
conclusions literally or mathematically.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.010
