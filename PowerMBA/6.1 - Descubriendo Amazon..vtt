00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.590
In this class we will analyze one

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.210
of the most exciting and complex

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150
companies that exist.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.970
Today what we're going to do is, let's

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.770
look at Amazon's major strategic

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.850
moves throughout its history and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.450
it'll help us understand much more

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.010
what Amazon is, something that's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.570
not easy, and how it's come

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.750
to be what it is today.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.650
In later classes, we will

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.390
now look at Amazon in more

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.590
detail from different

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.590
perspectives, such as its

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.750
competitive advantage

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.190
or its growth strategy.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.870
I always say that to understand a

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.390
company you have to know the founder,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
you have to know the leader,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.810
in this case it is Jeff Bezos, because

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.130
if we analyze how Jeff Bezos is,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.570
from that analysis it is much

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
easier to identify what have

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.350
been the keys to Amazon's success.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.290
Well, Jeff Bezos is a dreamer, he

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.970
is a very brave person who has always

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.930
proven to be able to challenge

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.330
the status quo, and as an

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.710
example, as an anecdote, his

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.170
latest project Blue Origin is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.890
designing a rocket to make

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.670
space travel.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.790
Well, let's go back to the year

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.830
94-95, let's go back to the first

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.930
steps or the origins of Amazon.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.370
Here we have Jeff Bezos working

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.050
at Wall Street, he provided

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.050
computer services to a company at

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.890
Wall Street and at some point it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.270
seems that a report fell into his

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.530
hands that vaticinated that

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.170
the growth of the digital channel,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.590
the internet, the e-commerce would

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.550
be exaggerated, and at that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.790
time he decided that he would

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.770
not let that train pass, which

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.950
would take advantage

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.450
of that opportunity.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.470
So I decided to start

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.250
an e-commerce.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.910
E-commerce of what?

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.050
Because you have in mind that at that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.750
time still the electronic

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.130
sale, the sale through the internet

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.170
almost did not exist, was something

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.730
with very much uncertainty.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.670
The categories that seemed

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.050
to be more successful and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.110
faster were mostly books

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.310
and music.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.150
Why is it?

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.390
Because it is a very standardized

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.030
product with very high margins

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.430
and that in principle seemed

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.470
to give little fear to buy through

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.250
the internet.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.410
Now everything has been bought through

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.510
the internet, but at that time it was

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.130
unthinkable to buy, for example,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.730
clothes or food or something like

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.430
that.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.230
Well, total, that Jeff Bezos

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.710
decided to set up an e-commerce,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.110
competing with traditional

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110
retailers of physical offline

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.610
bookstore like it was

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.950
mainly Barnes & Noble.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.550
This was not the first e-commerce

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.870
book that existed, there were already

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.390
some, a couple of them.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.330
Amazon has quickly outperformed

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.010
its competition.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.430
In the first 12 months,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.950
he was present in 40 countries

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.130
and billed about $100,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.810
000 a month.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.370
Conclusion of this?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Two conclusions are.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.510
One, that international

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.830
expansion was immediate, that their

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.670
vocation was always to be global and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.750
two, that quickly valid that there

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.050
was demand, that people were

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.230
willing to buy books over the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.970
internet.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.390
Well, the first years are passing,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.130
we are in the year 98 and we

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.170
already have the company of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.730
a certain size with a turnover

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.330
of $148 million annually.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.220
Amazon was the world leader

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.620
in selling books over

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.240
the internet.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.540
However, Bezos's vision

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.100
went far beyond.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.100
As we have said many times, a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.640
company's strategy should start

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.620
with a vision.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.640
What is the vision of Amazon?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.600
It is the largest store in the world.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.840
A store where you can

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.040
find and buy anything.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.660
Anything any.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.400
And they have succeeded.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.980
And how did they it?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.620
Well, then if you part that in

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.140
the year 98 you have an e-book

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.960
trade, what is it that you have

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.000
to do to become the world's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.880
largest store?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.620
It is important

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.660
to systematically

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.020
add new categories.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.440
And they are doing so until today.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.160
They are constantly

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.280
adding new categories.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.000
The first was music and music.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.960
It was easy to incorporate toys,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.780
home, video games, fashion,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.060
food, furniture.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.280
And I recently incorporated

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.740
subscription services, such as

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.960
streaming music or a movie service

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.120
similar to what Netflix

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.940
might have.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.900
What is Amazon today?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.720
It is the largest store in the world.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.260
I think that's their main

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.380
competitive advantage.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.640
The main competitive advantage

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.740
of Amazon is that you can go

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.700
in and buy anything.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.240
The next day, you have it at your door.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.210
Let's look at all the major

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.970
strategic moves of Amazon.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.310
It is vertical integration.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.270
We will put ourselves in a situation.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.870
Amazon quickly became the most

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.390
book-selling company in the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.750
world.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.290
It acquired a huge dominant

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.810
position in this sector in

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.070
very few years.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.270
This has created a lot of tension.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.770
Why did it generate attempts

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.350
to establish new aggressive conditions

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.510
with publishers?

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.410
Publishers depended on Amazon and

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.930
Amazon depended on publishers.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.250
What is what happens?

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.450
Amazon is now integrating backwards

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.890
and creating its own

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.930
Amazon Publishing.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.850
Enter the publisher's business.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.330
It becomes your own provider.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.830
And within Amazon there is content or

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.210
books that are from Amazon

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.350
Publishing and other publishers.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.290
But this move allows you to

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.990
enter the publishing business

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.550
with huge competitive advantages.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.690
It allows you to increase the

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.050
margins of your business because

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.850
you are left with the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.170
corresponding margins that were

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.910
previously created by publishers.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.330
And most importantly, it

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.570
is a weakness for publishers.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.810
Amazon is no longer as dependent

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.970
on publishers as it used to be.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.350
That makes publishing companies

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.130
lose has allowed Amazon to have

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.650
much greater control over the

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.110
sector and greatly strengthen

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.950
its competitive advantage.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.350
Another key strategic

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.250
move for Amazon was that in the

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.850
year 2000 it went from being a

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.170
pure e-commerce to a marketplace.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.590
Amazon Marketplace is born.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.970
What does this mean?

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.730
Until 2000, you could only

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.010
buy products from Amazon.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:40.630
Products that Amazon becomes a

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.810
platform, in a marketplace

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.130
where you can buy products

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.230
in some cases are from Amazon

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.910
but there are also third-party

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.310
companies that sell through

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.170
Amazon.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.610
As there are third-party companies

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.730
that sell through eBay for

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.270
example or Alibaba that are

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.290
pure marketplace that connect

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.630
supply and demand.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.950
Well since the birth of Amazon

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.050
Marketplace sales, the percentage

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.710
of third-party sales that

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.490
are not direct from Amazon

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.510
has been growing

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.210
and is currently 45 percent.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.410


00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.730
I'll tell you a little

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.690
bit about how it works,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.530
right?

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.190
On Amazon as I said you can buy

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.830
products from Amazon and on the

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.330
page when you see an offer because

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.310
you can see it here because it

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.350
says sold and sent by Amazon is

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.970
worth it?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.450
But you can also buy products

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.770
that are not from Amazon that are from

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.470
other companies and in this case

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.790
there are two options in some cases

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.510
Amazon takes care of logistics,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.030
takes care of stock, it is called

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.090
Fulfilled by Amazon and we have

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.620
it here that says sold by the

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.080
name of the seller but managed

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.500
by Amazon is it?

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.540
But it is also the case that it

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.500
is the third company the seller who

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.240
takes care of absolutely everything.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.780
Not only does it sell it but it also

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.240
manages logistics in this case Amazon does

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.980
not provide you with the logistics

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.900
service, right?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.020
And it costs less.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.780
And here we see it sold and shipped

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:12.450
by the seller's name Another very

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.810
important evolution in the

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.850
business model is the

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.030
incorporation of subscription

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.550
services mainly is Amazon

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.870
Prime.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.430
Until the birth of Amazon

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.510
Prime, Amazon only made money

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.010
for each transaction

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.370
that was made within the

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.410
e-commerce or within the marketplace.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.490
I was paying a percentage of that sale.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.350
The subscription model is very different

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.290
from the Amazon Prime model,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.130
which won a percentage

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.130
of one year.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.130
And in the case of Amazon Prime,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.450
the annual model to benefit from

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.450
a number of services.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.850
They have better conditions than

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.430
the rest in terms of distribution,

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.290
in terms of logistics services

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.890
but also have access to

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.050
Amazon Prime Video, which is

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.890
a movie and series service similar

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.970
to Netflix or HBO for example.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.270


00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.850
Amazon Prime is a success.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.090
It currently has around 65 million

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.790
subscribers and generates

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.810
sales of $6.5 billion.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.250
But the important thing is to understand

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.230
the difference in the business model.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.330
The benefits of a subscription

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.790
model system are that they are

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.170
recurring income.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.550
You pay for those 65 million

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.890
subscribers, you pay for them

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.790
every month and you make

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.230
those customers become much

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.770
more loyal to Amazon because

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.310
they are getting more and more

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.410
value-added services.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.750
The movies, music, deliver

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.850
in better conditions than

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.830
the rest, etc.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.670
You are getting more loyal to

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.130
your customers, which also increases

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.750
your expenses.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.090
Amazon Prime customers

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.330
are also buying more

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.670
products.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.030
In addition to paying the fee, you buy

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.710
more products.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.220
By the way, and in line with

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.400
the incorporation of subscription

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.940
services Amazon has created Music

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.020
Unlimited which is a streaming

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.400
music service similar to Spotify.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.660
Amazon's most successful

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.240
diversification

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.000
growth strategy is

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.460
undoubtedly the one we'll

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.940
see now.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.100
Amazon is entering the cloud

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.800
service through Amazon

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.980
Web Services.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.520
You think Amazon had developed

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.980
a huge internal infrastructure

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.840
to support its internal

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.600
operations.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.740
But what did you do is start selling

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.860
those services to third companies,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.500
right?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.440
by a monthly end.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.160
Amazon Web Services already

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.260
earns more than $12 billion

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:42.900
a year.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.960
And not just that, which is most important.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.040
74% of Amazon's total profit

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.940
comes from Amazon Web Services.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.420
Amazon is now much more than

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.200
the world's largest store.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.200
The main growth engine

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.500
is Amazon Web Services.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.980


00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.620
But Amazon's diversification

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.520
strategy really doesn't

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.560
end here.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.780
What Amazon has done is for all

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.880
these years and it continues

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.020
to permanently get into that

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.380
are more or less away from

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.940
their traditional business.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.900
Amazon is a hardware

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.580
manufacturer.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640
Kindle is one of the biggest

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.700
manufacturers of tablets, but

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.300
it also produces Kindle tablets.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.100
He tried it with mobile phones, with

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.220
smartphones.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.100
It is an online supermarket

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.240
through Amazon Fresh.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.700
Not just online but offline because you've

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.940
bought Whole Foods.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.400
As we see the entry into offline

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.480
retail, offline food distribution

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.440
is a business that is more

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.320
away from its traditional

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.220
business.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.020
He is also a fashion maker through

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.500
his brand Find with which he

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.700
wants to compete with large

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.240
groups such as Gap, H&M or

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.020
Inditex.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.180
Over the years, he has been

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.160
buying many companies.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.680
The most well-known probably because

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.460
Zapos or Alexa with which it is having

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.440
recently a lot of success.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.400
As we can see, it is a large group

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.460
that is present in very

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.240
many sectors with very different.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.220
And finally I will explain the

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.900
key that Amazon has been covered

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.560
for all these years to enter

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.820
so many, putting in Y is the

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.060
policy of so extreme reinvestment

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.220
it has had, which has

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.360
even generated a lot of

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.280
distrust in the markets.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.040
I remember a few years ago people

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.300
were asked if Amazon would

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.560
be profitable at some point because

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.600
it didn't generate any profits.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.440
And why?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.940
Bezos has always decided to reinvest

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.200
absolutely all the margins

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.020
that were generated.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.900
What I wanted was to always be

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.600
ahead, to innovate permanently

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.760
at any cost, regardless

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.580
of whether it was not efficient.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.520
Of course, when you enter, when

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.480
you diversify, when you enter

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.720
new, at first those demand

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.260
a lot of treasury and

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.720
you are not efficient.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.240
That is why the curve

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.940
with the evolution of sales

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.340
and net profits has this unique

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.020
shape.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.120
And the sales have been shot.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.540
Fijaros has sold $136 billion.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.440
The benefits have been

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.140
very planned.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.240
This never happens.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.960
And the difference between the

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.440
two is mainly due to what I'm

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.640
talking about, the huge

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.200
reinvestment that has been made

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.400
and that's the key to what Amazon

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.460
is today.
