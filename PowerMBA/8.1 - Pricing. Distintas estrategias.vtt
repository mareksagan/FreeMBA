00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
The first one is the leader, the leader in losses and this is a pricing strategy that

00:13.720 --> 00:18.600
many companies do, especially retailers or e-commerce.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.000
What is done is when you have a wide range of products, you use one or several products

00:23.000 --> 00:29.160
as a hook and you put a price that in many cases does not allow you to make money and

00:29.160 --> 00:33.280
in some cases you can be even in losses, but it has a benefit and that is that you attract

00:33.280 --> 00:37.520
many customers, you attract them to your website, you attract them to your store, etc.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.520
This is called the leader.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.820
What you are going to do is you are going to attract customers with those products with which you earn

00:42.820 --> 00:45.760
very little money but you are going to make those customers profitable with another series

00:45.760 --> 00:51.440
of products that you have or because the customer lifetime value, the permanence of your customers

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
is very high.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.080
I'm going to give you an example.

00:55.080 --> 01:01.720
Walmart, Walmart, the basic products are, you could make the purchase at Walmart and

01:01.720 --> 01:04.240
they really do not earn anything with you.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.840
What happens is that this is allowing them to attract a lot of traffic to supermarkets

01:08.840 --> 01:11.960
and in the end, as it has such a wide offer, you end up buying more things.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.060
That is a leader loss strategy.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.520
The same strategy was used by Amazon when it launched its tablet, which is the Kindle

01:18.520 --> 01:21.240
Fire, the first Kindle Fire HD.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.120
It came out with a much lower market price than its competitors, it squeezed the margins

01:26.120 --> 01:30.760
a lot, Amazon did not care at that time, what it wanted was to attract more customers

01:30.760 --> 01:33.160
that it was going to make profitable in other ways.

01:33.160 --> 01:41.000
Let's see another example of the leaders, which are the blades, for example, the Gillette blades.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.160
When Gillette sells the mango, the margin is much smaller.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.400
I don't think it loses money, but it has squeezed the margins a lot because what they want is not

01:49.400 --> 01:55.000
to make money with the mango, what they want is to make money with the blades that they sell later.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.160
This price fixing tactic, in addition to being a leader loss, to use that concept,

02:01.160 --> 02:06.800
what we can move on to the next one, which in English is called captive pricing, which is to use

02:06.800 --> 02:08.840
the captivity of customers.

02:08.840 --> 02:14.040
And the same thing Gillette does with the blades, for example, does it in Espresso.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.040
With the coffee makers, it earns little money, it has greatly reduced its margins, but what it does

02:19.040 --> 02:21.280
is make money with the capsules.

02:21.280 --> 02:28.080
Or they do the same, the printers have always done it, they sell the hardware,

02:28.080 --> 02:36.160
they sell it with very low margins because they know they are going to make money by putting a higher price,

02:36.160 --> 02:42.800
not a higher price, but by applying much higher margins to the cartridges.

02:42.800 --> 02:49.200
In this case, the concept of loss leader is given, because we apply very low margins to a product

02:49.200 --> 02:55.120
to make it profitable with another series of products, but we go further because they are customers

02:55.120 --> 03:01.800
who are almost captive, because if they don't buy the blades, if they don't buy the ink cartridges

03:01.800 --> 03:07.600
or if they don't buy the coffee maker capsules, the purchase they have made of the coffee maker, etc.,

03:07.600 --> 03:11.200
is not worth anything, therefore the customer is captive.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.200
Let's see now a very interesting concept, which is the bundle.

03:15.200 --> 03:24.200
Bundles consist of grouping a series of products of your offer and putting a common price.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.200
And this is very common, for example, in the menus in the hamburger shops,

03:29.200 --> 03:36.200
that you have the hamburger, the potatoes and the drinks, and the bundles that they make in the cinema are very well understood,

03:36.200 --> 03:40.200
that you go and buy the popcorn and the Coca-Cola.

03:40.200 --> 03:47.200
And it has many advantages, it is a very effective pricing strategy, for several reasons,

03:47.200 --> 03:52.200
you will understand it well, from the point of view of the seller, let's think about the cinema,

03:52.200 --> 03:55.200
what it allows is to increase the average ticket a lot.

03:56.200 --> 04:04.200
You go to the cinema and you spend almost always, per person, another 10 euros more for this bundle.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.200
So you can increase the average ticket, but also from the perspective of the customer,

04:09.200 --> 04:13.200
it is very comfortable, because it is usually given in complementary products.

04:13.200 --> 04:18.200
And in addition to the comfort of buying complementary products, because you want both,

04:18.200 --> 04:24.200
there is another quite psychological factor, and it is that when you buy a bundle you are perceiving that you save.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.200
And the curious thing is that in some cases the savings is minimal, that is, the cinema could put,

04:29.200 --> 04:35.200
regarding the prices separately of popcorn and Coca-Cola, could make a reduction of only 5%,

04:35.200 --> 04:39.200
and customers would go directly to the bundle because they would perceive that they are saving,

04:39.200 --> 04:41.200
when the savings is totally residual.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.200
Therefore, as you can see, it is a technique that must be understood well, because it has many benefits for the seller.

04:47.200 --> 04:55.200
In some cases, bundles are used to give way to products that individually have a lower demand.

04:56.200 --> 05:02.200
And it occurs to me, for example, when in a tailor's shop they sell you a tailored suit with a shirt,

05:02.200 --> 05:04.200
for example, two shirts and a tie, two ties.

05:04.200 --> 05:10.200
Well, those ties are likely to be costing the tailor to sell them, you are touching too much.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.200
And the bundle allows you to give way to that type of product.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.200
Let's now see a concept that we all understand, which are promotions and discounts.

05:19.200 --> 05:25.200
We are talking about a tactic, a tactic that leads you to increase demand on a timely basis.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
We are not talking about a low-cost strategy.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.200
And what happens sometimes with promotions and discounts is that if you abuse,

05:34.200 --> 05:39.200
you are transmitting a message to the market, you may be destroying your positioning,

05:39.200 --> 05:42.200
or you may be becoming directly a low-cost competitor.

05:42.200 --> 05:49.200
And if this is not your strategy, if it is not what you have decided, you may be destroying your business.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.200
Because you get customers used to buying always with discounts,

05:55.200 --> 05:57.200
and it turns out that in the end they end up perceiving you as...

05:57.200 --> 06:00.200
It is impossible for customers to buy the original price again.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.200
There are different ways to do it, to make promotions.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.200
There are some that are more elegant, so to speak, in some way than others.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.200
And there are some that are more destructive to your brand.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.200
Coupons, for example, you can play with coupons if you do not do it too aggressively,

06:12.200 --> 06:16.200
because the coupon only gives a discount to someone you have chosen.

06:17.200 --> 06:23.200
Someone who, for example, I don't know, you can offer a coupon in exchange for their data on the website,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
or a coupon for loyalty, etc.

06:26.200 --> 06:31.200
It is true that the coupon strategy, if you do it too aggressively,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.200
you may be causing a huge damage.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.200
And, for example, there are platforms of coupons in which to position yourself there,

06:38.200 --> 06:41.200
like Groupon, for example, is quite dangerous.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
At least it is dangerous.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.200
There are the discounts that we all know, in which in this case what we do is a discount for everyone.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.200
Usually the discounts are given in retail, in the selling points,

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
whether physical or e-commerce.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.200
Another way to make promotions is that in English,

07:00.200 --> 07:03.200
they call it BOGOF, which is Buy One, Get One Free.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.200
Well, in the end I have put buy two and get one free.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.200
What you do is give away the second or third unit.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.200
And the best of all, perhaps, are the cards or the decentralization programs,

07:15.200 --> 07:18.200
because deep down they are promotions, they are discounted,

07:18.200 --> 07:21.200
but you are only rewarding your most loyal customers.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.200
Therefore, you are giving them a positive message, not a negative one.
