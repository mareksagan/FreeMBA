00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.110
Lets talk about SEO.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.430
We are talking about SEO.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.770
We all have heard

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.450
of SEO.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.710
Yes, we have heard a lot.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.550
It is a very complex world

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.150
behind SEO.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.930
Yes yes.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.410
Search Engine Optimization.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.410
It encompasses many things,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.010
but the fundamental goal is to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.410
optimize your website to appear

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.510
in organic search results.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.410
Google is now the two largest

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.270
search engines in the world.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.830
But not only do your links

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.790
appear, but generate free

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.310
charity traffic to your

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.030
website.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.390
Some things you said, I will

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.670
highlight, are appearing first

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.190
on organic search engines

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.070
without paying.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.710
What has an advantage is that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.270
it will generate sustainable traffic

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.290
in the medium term without paying

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.890
for each of those clicks.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.010
This can be very beneficial

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.050
for a company.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.790
and totally.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.970
It is also often a charity

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.870
trade.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.530
I think we understand the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.030
main benefit and it is sustained

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.350
generation of traffic without

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.130
variable cost.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.290
But having said this, what can we do?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.110
What can a company do to, instead

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.710
of being on the eighth page,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.070
that no one comes, be in the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.670
first, in the fourth place?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.700
To answer this question correctly,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.760
you need to understand a little,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.080
very schematically, how

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.000
a search engine works.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760
How Google works.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.680
What we see as a user is, I do a search

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.740
and it gives me this of results.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.360
But to get to this there

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.200
is all a pre-work, which

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.300
we call indexing.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.320
Is it a pre-work that does who?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.360
The search engine or the company?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.240
What the search engine does.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.120
The search engine is a process, let'

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.060
s say more than a job, it is a technological

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.560
process.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600
What he does schematically is, command

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.520
the search engine, what we call

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.200
robots, through all those computers

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.960
of the earth, across the Internet,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.540
and goes listing

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.540
all the web pages.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.920
And when you find this robot

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.480
or spider, this spider, a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.960
web page, what it does

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.860
is behave exactly like a standard

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.100
user.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.140
It's that you read the web page, analyze

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.860
what's there, see a link, go to the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.820
other page, etc.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.000
This is an indexing process.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580
The purpose of robots is, what is it?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.680
For each of the URLs, for each

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.300
of the pages, it is to identify

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.100
which keywords are, put them

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.320
in your database, and from

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.120
there build the search

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.540
results for each of

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.300
those words.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.520
This is schematically.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.000
So, the first job to do when

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.160
we want to optimize SEO

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.300
is to facilitate this job,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.320
this indexing process.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.600
This is basically technical.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.320
We have to let these robots,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.060
these spiders, pass by so that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.740
they do their job properly.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.100
That is the first job.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.540
There are several tools that allow

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.540
you to identify whether your page

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.400
is well indexed, the problems there

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.100
are, etc.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.700
This is almost a computer

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.640
work.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.820
You can also prepare your website so that the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.820
robot can read it better.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.060
It is exactly that.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.580
The second job is a much more

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.640
marketing job.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.360
It's a job of defining what the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.720
famous keywords are for which

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.240
I'm going to try to appear.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.820
And for this, what I have to do

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.040
is, again, analyze what the searches

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.460
are.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.720
Google tools give us some ideas

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.680
and we need to have this idea

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.160
of a pool marketing.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.980
Users are looking for things.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.340
Do I want to answer or do I not want

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.620
to answer this question?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.320
If I want to answer, I will give you

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.840
the right answer.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.040
Do I have good content?

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.240
Yes or not.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.140
If I have it, what I have to

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.480
do is optimize this content.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.640
That is, to go back to the indexing

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.740
part, it's to place where this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.360
keyword is allowed and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.220
where it makes sense within

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.060
my content.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.240
This is like deciding where you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.300
want to compete or where you

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.800
want to play.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.940
It is exactly this.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.360
The NBA Power.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.180
A key word would be the power NBA,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.700
but that's very easy, that's the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.300
example we've put.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.380
I think we can compete in the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.280
NBA.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.500
The NBA online.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.520
Or we can compete, imagine, I don't

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.500
know, in startup or in digital marketing

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.280
or in business.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.060
We have to decide where we want to play.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.840
actually is.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.980
And once you have this decision,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.200
this list made, you look at your

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200
website and you say, hear, what I

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.860
have today, this page in particular,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.480
this category or this content,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.220
because it does correctly

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.080
respond to this.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.070
There the job is, I have to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.110
adapt a little bit of things to

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.910
put this keyword here or this

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.130
word here so that the robot

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.130
understands that it is this one

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.470
I want to press.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.850
So this is a job, there is

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.190
a lot of writing work.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.790
Besides the discussion, there

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.230
is also a writing part.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.830
If you have nothing, you have

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.690
to decide and write and produce content.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.430
The third element, to understand the

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.450
third element, is to understand

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.990
a little the mission given in

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.970
search engines.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.710
The mission that is given is, I will

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.750
give my user the best result for

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.970
their search.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.350
That is their mission.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.630
At least they are advertising that.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.540
They consider a web page to be

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.120
relevant to a topic, for a keyword,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.220
not only if you have indexed it

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.740
well, or if it has relevant

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.060
content, but if there are

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.060
other external pages that talk

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.560
about redirecting traffic

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.680
to this same web page.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.480
That is a job of analyzing and

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.940
encouraging the links referring

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.360
to your website.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.160
This allows you to build an

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.920
element that we call popularity

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.240
of your website.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.180
The more pages talk about you,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.740
the more popular you get.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.920
As followers, we will say that.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.280
A little the same logic.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.480
This is a key point of SEO.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.040
I will summarize the three things

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.000
you said very quickly to finish.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.120
If we want to optimize SEO,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.740
go up, we have to, first, prepare

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.560
our website technically so

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.720
that that spider, that

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.040
robot that scans everyone

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.960
is able to read those words.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.700
But we have to choose which

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.460
word is key.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.180
We want to compete or play, which

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.240
depends on many things, as you said.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.580
And finally, what we have to do

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.060
is keep in mind that robots are

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.740
not only a subject of reading the

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.540
word, but they also take into account

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.020
which pages are more relevant,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.520
more popular, etc.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.020
And the main criterion that

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.240
Google uses to tell whether your

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.220
page or the competitor's page puts

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.520
it higher or lower based on

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.660
relevance, is that there are

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.760
external links from other web

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.380
pages, social networks, etc.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.160
Let us say they are...
