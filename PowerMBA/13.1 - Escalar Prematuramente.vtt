00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.800
I would like to analyze Nonavox

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.600
from the perspective of the

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.960
phases of product development

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.820
that we have defined four

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.680
phases that are the problem

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.680
solution fit, problem market

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.440
fit, the growth engine

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.840
and finally scale.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.380
And you did some things well and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.600
others didn't, and the mistakes you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.900
made can be explained from this

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.900
perspective.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.120
Could we make a development?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.360
Well, because in a first phase Nonavox

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.740
emerges from my experience as

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.420
a country manager of Glossybox

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.960
in Spain for Rocket Internet.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.060
Glossybox is a cosmetic

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.860
subscription model, so while I'm

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.300
launching Glossybox in Spain

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.040
I realize that the subscription

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.480
model is a very interesting model

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.540
at the economic level because

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540
you have a very good recurrence,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.580
you have very high margins and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.560
it's also the typical business

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.300
model in which it's a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.140
win-win.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.680
That is, you win the brand that collaborates

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.240
with you, the customer wins because

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.380
it receives more value than it is

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.120
paying and in the middle you win

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.360
because you have very high margins

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.760
and a very high recurrence.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500
Therefore, here is a key point in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.720
the business model that was ultravalidated,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.480
because that model you were running

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.300
in another sector and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.840
then you had checked that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.720
it works, that the accounts

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.740
come out, that the brands

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.360
give you free products and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.680
you charge a subscription

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380
to customers.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.500
That mechanism was...

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.640
It was working very well in the cosmetics

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.620
sector and what we saw was that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.520
in the cosmetics sector the costumer

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.260
live value was not too long, that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.740
is, at four or five months the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.900
clients were bored and were

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.540
down because they already had

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.760
very many samples and did

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.960
not have the power to try

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.440
it all.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.700
So, in the desire to look for a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.140
market in which this costume live

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.980
value would be longer, wider,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.380
we find ourselves in the baby

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.700
sector and in the baby sector from

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.080
birth until they are two years

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.440
old grow so fast that there

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.140
is a hole to send them

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.000
different products continuously

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.580
without the subscriber,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.920
in this case the mom, losing

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.920
interest.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.200
You had to validate that what

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.900
worked in the cosmetics sector

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.760
would work in the baby sector,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.720
not only would it work,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920
but the custom would be bigger

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.280
because the lifetime would

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.100
be longer, more months.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.840
Basically, with this more elaborate

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.700
pitch we got 40,000 euros of funding,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.880
this was in November 2011

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.440
that we were surrounded by cabides

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.820
and partners and what they asked

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.000
us was, you have these 40,000

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.420
euros to develop a MVP, get

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.420
the brands of the baby sector

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.680
to give you up to 5,000 boxes,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.800
that you can fill 5,000 boxes

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.820
without product costs by the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.720
brands and that you can

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440
get the first customers.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.640
With these 40,000 euros in three

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.760
months we launched the web, achieved

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.100
the first 15 clients and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.760
filled the first 5,000 product

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600
boxes without cost by brands

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.560
in the sector.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.780
That is, the first step that could

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.440
be problem solution fit because you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.240
validated it perfectly because in

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.480
how many months?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.980
Three.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.620
In three months you validated that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.520
the brands were ready and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.100
validated you on a very small scale

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.920
because you said 15 clients,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.880
15 clients is almost, you tell

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.660
them around, but at least

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.900
that seemed to make sense

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.100
that people saw value.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.400
justly.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.260
With this small validation of the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.300
problem solution fit, cabides gives

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.660
us 110,000 euros more to start

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.640
validating the capture channels.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.300
Hear, we have already validated that there

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.580
is, it seems that there is a hole in

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.640
the market, now we will validate which

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.320
channels work for us and to what extent

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840
they work for us to capture customers

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.880
on the v2c side for this point.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.080
I would tell you that at this point

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.000
when you have 15 customers and you have

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.920
to have thousands are not the capture channels,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.240
that is, you have to validate

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.000
that there are no 15 crazy.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.920
Yes, that goes a little further.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.360
There is a market.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.560
You validated that the problem existed,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760
that the solution existed, it is

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.540
true that you validated it because

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.460
there were people who were

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.440
willing to pay for it.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.740
I think the next challenge is to say

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.280
there are people, but how many are they?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.640
Let's see if they are 15.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.660
justly.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.180
So this was good, this was already

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.560
March 2012 and with these 110,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.460
000 euros we started to invest in marketing,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.480
but as always when you start investing,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.500
well because you are trying

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.720
a lot of things and you still don'

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.580
t have the metrics as very clear,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.920
but well with the little we started

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.660
to invest suddenly we have a thousand

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.160
customers, they call us in

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.520
Italy for a weekend, for a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.960
Global Celebrator Week, I don'

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.600
t know what, of startups and that

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.500
weekend we come out with 750,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.700
000 euros committed to

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.900
investment and with the commitment

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.240
on our part to launch Nonavox

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.880
in Italy and Germany.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.000
That is to say you were in a good

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.440
place really because if you had a thousand

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.880
customers and it hadn't cost too

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.980
much to catch up.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.400
These things are known quickly,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200
that is, when you go out to the market

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.900
and it doesn't cost you much to

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.960
capture, not only online, but

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680
sometimes it seems a little bit

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.880
of wipes or common sense, but

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.900
when you are a very good product

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.820
you tell it to people around

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.220
and people around want to buy it.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.440
It is very simple, many times we

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.140
go crazy, but you did, I imagine,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.520
not much investment, because

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.880
you were, how many there were?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.620
110,000 and we already started to have

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.380
a little structure, we had invested

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.500
very little in that stage.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.060
I think you could say that you

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.160
were close to the Product Market

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.840
Fit because at least you were seeing

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.780
that you were bringing value,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780
which I don't know if at that

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.020
time you had checked that the clients

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.440
stayed, probably

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.760
didn't give you even time.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.200
Of course, we had checked that

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.040
we were having good acceptance

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.300
and that the three boxes we had

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.420
sent, because we had not given

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.560
time to send more, because the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.380
reviews were good by the clients,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.560
it is true that there were

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.500
bad reviews also that were not

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.440
serving to improve, but well,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.820
the three months had been left,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.280
but it is true that we could

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.460
not have visibility of the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.480
Costumer Lifetime Value because

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.000
we were sending boxes for three

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.740
months.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.940
Yes, but the signals were actually

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.540
very good.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.600
In the end, when you have to validate

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.660
a business model, it is that

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.760
you draw the canvas and it is almost

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.980
a checklist, that is, we have validated

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.340
that this people like, because

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.300
you were validating it

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.740
because the reviews were good.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.120
Are you sure they will be with

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.940
us for 15 months?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.320
No, but it's not 15

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.920
months.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.260
Well, then you are at that point,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.440
everything was very good and we

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.280
started to internationalize.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.240
He warms your heads with people.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.960
We all warm up, suddenly it makes

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.720
us all like a lot of illusion.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.500
We see that in Spain it is growing

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.860
fast, it is true that in those

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.140
years, 2011-2012, it was now as

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.520
they are with blockchain and with all

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880
that kind of things, at that

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.500
time were the subscription models.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.720
There were subscription models

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.700
of virtually anything you

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.340
can imagine.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.280
It was like Birchbox in the

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.260
United States raising millions

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.960
of dollars, Rocket Internet

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.180
with Glossybox was doing it

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.160
super well in Europe and

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.920
they were starting to come out

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.560
subscription models everywhere.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.880
And it was beginning to have very interesting

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.980
successes, that as we have seen in

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.760
the financing module,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.620
because it is true that sometimes the

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.060
sexiness of the market also influences

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.700
and that there are other people

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.900
making a lot of money or there

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.420
are successes in the same vertical

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.440
that you are doing or are

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.040
raising very large rounds, investors

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.640
are served as validation.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.520
Then, at that moment of boom

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.600
of subscription models and

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.700
with the good initial metrics

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.080
we were beginning to have,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.920
we all excited and launched

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.260
to internationalize.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.040
Well, what happened?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.140
What happened?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.820
Well then...

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.120
What happened?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.080
Because you were in a very good

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.160
position, that is...

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.300
We were in a very good position

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.000
that now looking back,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.480
what we did was skip

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.820
one of the stages.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.400
So, without having validated

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.880
what our channels were and without

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.380
having the clear key metrics, which

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.020
are the CPA, the costumer life value

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.200
and the churn, we launched to

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.280
open new markets.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.040
In July, or four months after

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.320
launching Spain, we had four

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.780
boxes sent to Spain, we launched

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.280
Italy and in October we

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.860
launched Germany.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.820
Four months.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.880
Four boxes and we had four months

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.880
starting to do attempted marketing.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.580
We go to another market, but not

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.660
only go to another market,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.680
but at that time no one is aware

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.640
that to sell in Germany or

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.100
to sell in Italy by digital

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.620
we do not need a physical

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.740
office there.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.560
So we opened a physical office

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.200
in Italy, with equipment in Italy,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.780
we set up a company in Italy

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.760
and we do the same in Germany.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.680
Automatically, our structure,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.080
which was super simple and super

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.800
link, complicates a barbarism.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.720
We are starting to get duplicate positions.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.840
We have three marketing directors,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.020
three country managers, three

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.840
logistics suppliers, three

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.880
box suppliers.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.340
That is, it begins to complicate

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.640
the thing, costs increase and

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.720
the corporate structure also

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.780
increases, because we also have

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.340
three companies that all belong

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.320
to a holding company.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.860
We are in a time of complication.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.780
Beyond the money, because at

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.800
that time we had money, we

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.120
had raised almost a million

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.600
euros.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.000
The problem is that we lose focus,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.700
which is one of the things we have

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.780
talked about and we will talk about

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.960
in subsequent classes, the

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.960
importance of focus.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.320
That is, at the stage we

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.040
were in, our focus had to be

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.760
on validating the capture channels.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.960
And our focus is, suddenly, on traveling

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.300
a lot, managing a much bigger

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.080
team, starting to validate

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.580
other kinds of things when

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.520
we didn't have the base.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.840
It is that you have skipped the

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.040
third phase that we have called

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.860
the growth engine.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.160
And it's a pity because there are

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.420
many companies that do it just

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.080
to scale before they get to Product

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.540
Market Fit.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.040
And Product Market Fit is the

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.500
most complicated thing to

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.560
get, but you got it, because people

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.140
were paying, people saw value,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.340
and so on.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.460
You were taking a path,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.980
a very good path, and

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.440
you committed the imprudence,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.240
which also pushed us to commit

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.400
it, to skip the third phase

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.840
and to go straight up the ladder

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.120
when the channels through which

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.720
we had to grow were not

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.480
entirely clear.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.380
It's like we've drawn before, if

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.380
you see a forest and you have to run

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.220
through that forest, you'll stumble

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.160
a thousand times.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.800
But if you first do what you

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.660
do is walk through the forest,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.680
you can already run around.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.420
In fact, this was the main

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.200
reason why we realized that

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.720
that very loquid structure

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.280
we had mounted had no

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.980
meaning.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.440
When we had already mounted all the

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.360
equipment and with all the

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.220
complexity I supposed, we started

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.500
trying to make the phase that touched

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.360
us that was the validation

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.640
of the capture channels.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.520
And what happened there?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.880
That when we started trying

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.840
to unify the campaigns we realized

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.780
we were losing a lot of business

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.020
intelligence because we had

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.160
given so much autonomy to

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.400
the country managers who were

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.740
doing things each in their

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.500
own way.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.960
We were not making a common

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.700
strategy.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.880
This made us realize that

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.800
it was being a real madness,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.980
because our idea was to encourage

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.360
country managers to

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.460
perform for their

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.560
country.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.560
What did we like that?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.260
That if, for example, the community

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.800
manager of Italy discovered a fantastic

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.080
way to sell through Instagram,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.400
instead of sharing it with the

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.680
rest of the countries so that

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.220
we all benefit from that

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.480
learning, she would be silent

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.160
because she was also encouraged

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.460
to see if Italy was going better.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.580
Then, suddenly we realized that

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.820
we were losing a lot of good practices

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.100
and a lot of learning that

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.480
we could take advantage

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.620
of between countries.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.820
I think it is the fruit of...

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.140
We could do a detailed analysis

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.940
of the mistakes made in internationalization,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.980
but it is the

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.180
result of the

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.200
rush.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.100
But really, I think the key is

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.560
not those mistakes you would

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.740
make like that detail.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.640
The key is that you did

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.260
it too soon.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.720
Too soon, because then when we

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.620
realized all this and closed all

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.040
the offices we had in Europe and

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.540
we brought it all to Spain and

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.000
started to manage, that at that time

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.660
there were already six countries,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.840
but we managed them all from

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.100
Madrid with a much smaller

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.580
team, when we started to make

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.180
the stage that had corresponded

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.680
to us, the one of validating

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.040
the growth engine, the metrics

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.600
we achieved were good, that is,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.240
at that time we captured the leads

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.800
to 40 cents, super qualified leads,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.100
which we multiplied the investment

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.160
by 4, we recovered

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.780
it in the month 2, that

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.160
is, it was a CPA of 15 euros

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.020
with a costumer live value

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.120
of 120 euros in profit.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.660


00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.460
And moreover, it is that here your

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.980
growth engine or your channel

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.500
channel of your customer capture

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.780
channel was purely digital.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.340
Purely 100%.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.140
That was, then the mistake was that

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.260
you directly developed

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.700
other channels, because you did

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.520
not know validated on a small scale,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.400
but if you had done that, if from

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.100
Madrid, without getting crazy,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.800
without a multinational structure

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.140
and you would have put you

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.200
to validate how it was the

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.880
best way to capture customers

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.200
in Italy or the like.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.780
I think we have to have made the

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.200
way, the reverse path that now seeing

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.560
it from now on is the most logical

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.420
of hearing, I start in Spain and

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.200
when I have validated my channels

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.020
in Spain, that are those strategies

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.540
that we have managed to develop

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.040
capto customers for 15 euros through

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.100
leads capture, through test, then

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.540
with inbound marketing, we have

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.520
a whole strategy in which I have

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.020
that validated, with that I open

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.580
Germany and replicate it in

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.960
Germany, I open Italy and

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.720
replicate it in Italy.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.580
Especially with a very scalable

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.460
product.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.280
Well, the only thing that wasn'

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.020
t scalable or the marks were worth

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.780
it for all...

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.740
No, but in the end we discovered that

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.340
with an account manager per country

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.780
more or less and without having

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.300
to travel, we telematically

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.560
achieved, that is, the value

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.880
proposal was so potent for

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.400
brands that with a aunt calling

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.160
brands we got it.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.140
And above all you just needed people

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.380
for that side of the customers,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.860
for the brands, for the capture

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.660
you could have taken

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.660
directly from here.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.560
Centralized marketing and doing something

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.540
more scalable of I have a type

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.880
of campaign that works for me in

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.660
Madrid, which is what we end up doing.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.180
Mother's Day campaign.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.380
We designed it in Spanish, then

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.940
it was translated into all languages,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.100
the creativities were replicated

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.460
and it was replicated in all

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.800
countries.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.080
Did this model work

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.800
or not?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.840
This model, i.e., looking back I would

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.620
say it was a model for launching

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.580
a viable business, but it wasn'

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.980
t a model for launching an investmentable

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.120
business.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.060
That is, with less investment, more

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.640
steady pace and so on, we actually

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.040
become profitable in Germany,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.440
Austria, France and Spain.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.620
That is, it was a profitable model

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.100
and it was a model that made sense,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.300
what it wasn't was an invertible

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.440
model to get it sold for 100 million

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.060
euros and those models' rhythms

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.760
were totally inviable.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.440
It was possible because you proved it.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.700
If you cost you to capture 15 euros

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.720
and you take 25 a month to each of

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.880
your customers and above are with

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.340
you 15 months, because the numbers

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.100
come out phenomenal.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420
What happens is that you have already

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.760
committed the mistake to finish, you

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.160
have made the mistake from this perspective

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.840
of the phases of business development,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.240
the product, the business model,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.460
to skip the phase, to validate the

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.980
channels and how money directly entered

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.620
to scale, above international

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.080
expansion with the risks that it

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.160
entails and that is good, because

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.800
it ended up addicting the company.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.800
It penalized us, we lost a year

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.220
and a half and a million euros

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.880
to expand and then bring

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.080
it all back and for when we wanted

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.060
to have those clear and validated

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.760
metrics, we had a valuation

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.760
already too high for more money

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.540
to enter and they could make

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.160
one in ten.
