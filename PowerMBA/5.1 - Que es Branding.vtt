00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.100
Miguel, you have already explained

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.960
what branding is, what it is not,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.580
what it serves, at what point we

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.700
must turn to what always,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.860
basically, and what are the benefits.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.120
We have also seen a case.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.060
But of course, we are in doubt, well,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.560
everything is very well, but

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.140
how do we land it in our business?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.420
In the business of each.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.280
And if you could give us a series

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.520
of concrete keys, based on your

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.260
experience, that help create a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860
powerful brand, I think it would

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.160
be very enriching.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.340
If you allow me, I will address this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.800
issue from what we do.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.360
When we help, entrepreneurs,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.160
brands in general, we identify

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.360
a series of elements that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.920
don’t just work well and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.220
we group them into five

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.240
major areas.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.020
The first is interiorization,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.540
what we call interiorization.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.060
Interiorization in the sense of knowing

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.440
that what you have in your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.640
hands is really a brand.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.700
And that that interiorization of the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280
importance of the brand can be silenced

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.360
in the rest of the organization.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540
Often it is the marketing director

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.740
who orders a review project,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.080
brand repositioning,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.880
and what you realize is that

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.740
there is a cultural problem

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.400
of interiorization.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.080
The CEO is an engineer or

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.760
a financial expert who has marketing

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.140
knowledge, but who does not just

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.060
understand the importance of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.900
branding so that it silences

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.420
first from within and then from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.300
outside, but first from within.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.140
A good general manager is a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.040
marketing expert who also knows

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.620
how to interpret a balance sheet.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.320
I cannot agree more.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.100
I also totally agree.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.620
That is, sometimes those people

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.820
don’t have great knowledge, but

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.500
they intuitively manage to create

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.040
their project from a marketing

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.360
or branding concept,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.100
if you want.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.360
The first key is to internalize.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.660
It is an internal work.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.680
You help all organizations

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.860
be aligned with that.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240
If we ask one who we are, and he tells

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.420
you one thing, another tells you another,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.900
many of them have contacts with

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.340
the end customer, because in

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.120
the end what you are

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.060
transmitting, the one who hires the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.840
marketing campaigns has an idea

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.040
in the head of what we are.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360
The market has others, etc.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.760
It is very important fundamentally

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.980
certain departments, but

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.700
in fact all.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.220
Branding is also that the person

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.840
who is receiving a visit or who

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.040
is on the other side of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.080
the phone respond appropriately

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.300
based on values, a personality,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.400
having very clear who is that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.800
brand, what it is and why

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.080
it is doing what it is doing.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.460
So the architecture of the building

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.200
is transmitting things of your

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.760
brand.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.920
The telephone operator is broadcasting

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.840
things of your brand.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.800
The product, of course, is the one

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.240
you are online or not online.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.660
Therefore, there is an exercise

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.020
of interiorization that is essential.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.920
Branding is important.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.300
What is at stake is a brand.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.660
We understand all and keep that

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.680
all in all the departments of the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.280
company.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
The second is the strategy.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960
Once we know who we are, what we are

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.040
and what we are not, we

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.380
define the strategy.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.420
The strategy is to know where

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.120
we are going.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.480
Seneca said that there is always a favorable

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.800
wind for those who know where they are

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.300
going.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.180
Well, because if we know who we are

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.860
and know where we are going, we

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.580
have already gained a lot.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.480
And large companies, small,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.460
entrepreneurs, can imagine

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.940
the number of dishonest

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.920
people that exist.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.140
Many, a huge majority.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.840
So let’s define the strategy

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.300
well and all align ourselves with

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.780
that strategy.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.260
Once we have a clear strategy,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.840
let’s project.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.940
And this is the third step, the projection.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.620
That brand has to consistently

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.860
move what it is and what it wants

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.780
to be at a strategic level.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.200
And starting with the name,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.980
following the visual identity, ending

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.420
with communication, by the development

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.840
of products and services that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.800
must be or not equal in all

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.280
countries and that there enter

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.340
strategic elements, elements

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.120
of brand coherence, brand

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.660
consistency, etc.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.640
So I still have the doubt here.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.940
In the projection, we will do

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.220
the job of identifying what are

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.640
all the aspects that have to

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.380
project our brand.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.080
Your brand is projecting.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.320
It is in every contact point

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
with the customer.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.800
We need to identify the contact

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.760
points with the customer journey

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.060
or some tool like that.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.700
exactly to.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.440
And from there, seek coherence

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.600
with what we say we are and with that

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.260
strategy that we have given ourselves

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.540
and that we have decided.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.260
If you want, in agreement.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.340
From that point on, the outlook

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.920
must be logical.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.780
It has to be meaningful in the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.280
framework of brand positioning.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.740
If I am a daring brand, I have

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.800
to show daring in the products

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.920
and services I launch and

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.060
in the way I communicate.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.960
If I am a conservative, it

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.740
is the opposite.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.620
One of the biggest problems

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.520
with brands is incoherence.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.120
In one country I am this and in another I

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.700
am this another.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.340
And the customer who goes and travels to

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.400
another country says, well, and this

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.360
brand what exactly is?

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.880
I start doing a lot of things and

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.460
I end up being nothing.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.640
The fourth element is leadership.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.540
We talked about the wolf.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.280
We don’t want wolf policemen.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.620
We want this shared leadership.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.020
Not so much of the person, of the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.720
CEO, if you want, but of those who

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.860
are pulling the brand.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.800
The set of leaders must be clear

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.020
that what they have in hand

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.700
is a brand and lead from the

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.880
point of view of what they

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.160
have in hand.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.260
The last, fifth, is to have

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.180
a brand management system.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.540


00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.960
Some systems, if you want, of surveillance.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.060
Some control systems, some

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.360
projections.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.900
For example, you need to

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.140
investigate what your brand reputation

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.580
is, what your brand image is, how

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.200
customers perceive your brand

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.280
in relation to the rest of competitors.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.000
All this allows us to

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.200
manage the brand properly.
