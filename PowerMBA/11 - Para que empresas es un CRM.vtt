WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.200
Jaime, we already understand very

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.400
well what CRM is, and I think

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.660
we have assimilated it as a tool

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.940
that can help us understand

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.000
and improve the customer, etc.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.640
What happens is that you are

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.480
the global CRM manager at Philips,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.360
because it's a big corporation,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.620
and our students have people

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.260
working in giant companies

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.800
like yours, but there are

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.160
people who have small.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.860
And what we have to make very

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.300
clear is that CRM is a

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.260
strategy applicable to any type

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.280
of company.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.120
to everyone.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.980
An example would be the neighborhood

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.200
carnage.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.480
He always has that close relationship

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.220
and he knows what we like, when

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.620
we go, this is extrapolable to a

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.280
big corporation.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.600
We should behave exactly

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.560
the same with our customers,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.520
know them, know what they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.360
want, what they need and when

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.320
we will be there.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.800
What kind of tools?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.760
I would like to give you a little

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.980
visibility based on the size of

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.540
the company.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.940
What types of tools can we use and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.160
how much does it cost?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.140
I think the main thing here

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.920
is to know your company and know

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.860
what you will need, because depending

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.880
on that one tool or another

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.800
can serve you.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.900
As we have mentioned before, maybe

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.440
a simple Excel in a starting state

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.380
can serve you, or an Access

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.800
where I have a list with my clients

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.880
and what things I am dealing

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.920
with them.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.720
If we start talking about

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160
platforms that are on the market,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.120
we could distinguish them

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.000
in three large groups.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300
The big players who are the leaders

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.120
in the market, if we go to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.460
Gardner's magic squares and things

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.500
like that, those who are always

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.700
up on the right, that can be

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.040
Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.420
Dynamics.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.140
All this is true that it has a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.860
relatively high price compared

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.580
to other players, but it is true

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.660
that it also has a lot

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.060
more capacity to adapt

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.420
to your company.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.440
In many cases you can customize

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.380
it simply with clicks, in other

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.600
cases at best if you need

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.480
some development of IT

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.800
teams behind it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.620
This is the vast majority of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.480
large companies they use,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840
also by the amount of integrations

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.020
they have with other

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.520
systems.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.120
In the bottom, what we are looking for

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.080
is to have information from all sides,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080
we will want to integrate it with

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.240
a RP system, with a SAP, or we will

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.560
want to integrate it with the web

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.160
or with an e-commerce.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.540
And these are, to make us the idea,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.000
almost megaprojects.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.560
They are usually megaprojects,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.020
although for example Salesforce

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.540
has licenses, for example, for

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.960
NGOs.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.080
I worked on projects in which there

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.700
were NGOs that were five people.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.180
There are also small packages

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.120
for this type of...

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.240
I'm not thinking from the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.320
software maker's perspective,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.260
but I'm thinking for large

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.040
companies, a CRM project is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.020
a megaproject.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.440
They are usually mega projects

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.660
because it's the amount of people

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.300
involved and the massive

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.560
amount of information we have

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.140
to store.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.520
They are usually massive projects.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.680
You usually need a consultant,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.160
who implants it, etc.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.420
justly.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.280
And it is a high cost.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.180
They are usually costly.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.680
Can you give it or is it...?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.380
It can be millions.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.640
Depending on which areas you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.520
are automating.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.220
You may decide that you just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.660
want to start by selling.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.860
But maybe if you want to

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.320
automate sales, marketing, customer

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.800
service, you will put in marketing

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.860
tools, automation, connections

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.100
with RPS, we can go

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.120
to millions.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.220
and perfect.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.920
In the second stage we would be in

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.480
tools or companies that are more medium-

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.460
sized.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.120
They are not startups, but they are

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.060
not big corporations.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.040
In this case, we might probably

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.180
go to, we could name, for example,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.560
Sugars CRM.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.820
It is a very powerful

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.480
tool too.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.000
The cost is a little lower than

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.440
in these cases, than in the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.460
previous cases, than Salesforce,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.860
than Dynamics.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.860
But it can also be customized quite a bit.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.240
It can be adapted to business.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.340
I think that would be a good example

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.960
for a medium-sized company.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.160
It has 150 employees and accounts for

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.760
20 million euros.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.180
I have a question about the march.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.220
How is this paid?

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.960
What is the cost format?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.660
Historically, they were licenses you

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.300
compared, implemented on your own

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.660
servers, and they are already there.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.220
You paid it once and you

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.020
should have to make a renovation.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.800
It's true that with the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.860
entire explosion of cloud computing

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.220
and SaaS models, this is a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.960
subscription you pay monthly.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.460
It has a certain trick because

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.740
usually what they ask for is a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.380
minimum stay of one year, which

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.100
also makes sense.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.500
Pay per user and per month.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.340
Depending on how many users you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.600
want to put in the platform and what

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.100
functionalities you want to put in,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.280
having small add-ons.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.340
It is usually monthly.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.120
Basically, and if I am wrong or

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.480
you correct me, you have

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.460
to pay initially in almost all

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.640
cases an implant.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.720
The company can do it for you.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.760
an external partner or a consultant.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.880
If you have an internal person, you can do it.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.640
But that has a cost and it is the implementation.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.840
And then what you pay is monthly

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.940
SaaS software that goes according

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.360
to the number of users.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.720
And also often depending on the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.400
functionalities you are going to hire.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.900
There is a cost many times that is

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.120
indirect, that people forget and that

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.160
I think it's important that it's

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.540
the whole part of managing change.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.940
In the bottom, this

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.620
is a tool that is alive and

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.660
will evolve as the

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.700
company evolves.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.640
You will always need

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.680
to update.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.440
Not in terms of software, but in

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.540
terms of processes, in terms of

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.060
the business rules you have implemented.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.560
This is a constant cost that you

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.760
will have to keep up to date.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.700
The same is true

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.120
of all users of these

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.140
platforms.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.500
This is a cost that people

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.860
and often forget.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.180
But if you really want this to

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.420
go ahead, it's a small game

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.720
that you have to always reserve.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.960
Basically that I think is

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.120
that over time you are learning

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.640
to use it better.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.540
Because your needs are changing.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.960
This is a permanent

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.940
adaptation.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.200
Today you want to measure this of the customer

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.380
but tomorrow you want to measure something else.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.320
Because you realized that the value

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.200
is in another data for example.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.940
That is.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.240
So if you have a rule of

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.480
automation that captures

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.160
that data.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.880
You should update it to capture

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.660
two or three more data.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.740
And make two or three decisions based

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.540
on all of this.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.080
There are constant

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.440
updates, both in knowledge

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.480
and technology.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.540


00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.540
How can or what tools

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.120
or how does CRM work

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.040
in small companies?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.020
In small, you usually have

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.220
software that is free or

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.200
that is premium models.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.860
That is, you may have certain

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.460
features or certain limited

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.500
users free.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.740
And according to that, you can then

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.320
pay certain salaries.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.960
There are companies, for example,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.180
you have Zoho CRM.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.340
There are many other types

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.680
of CRM, for example.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.060
There are several that are also

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.580
for SMEs and are thought for them.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.420
They do not have large integrations

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.300
with large systems.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.780
But these companies will not require

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.360
it either.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.400
It is just the best you

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.340
have.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.420
They have integrations.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.160
In some cases, we use what we use.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.120
They have integrations, for example,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.660
with tools to make mailings.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.880
They all have integrations.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.360
All of them.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.740
I think that's a very important

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.620
part that they have.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.840
So it's a bit what I was talking about at

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.200
the beginning.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.180
You need to know what your company

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.460
is going to publish.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.000
And based on all that, look for

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.760
which tool is the one that

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.780
best suits your needs.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.760
I always see it

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.740
as a kind of dress.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.900
It will be a company.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.620
In this case, a manufacturer.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.700
These are the models.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.880
But you have to adjust it to your needs.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.960
There are no two companies that

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.040
are exactly the same.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.180
What is the cost of a software

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.200
as a service, CRM?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.860
The analysis is too

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.920
simple.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.040
Let's make a little idea.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.460


00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.000
Take CRM for example.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.460
Just in that I don't know.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.180
It is true that we are on

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.700
average.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.800
This is the lower segment.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.860
It can be between 10 and 20 euros

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.780
per user per month.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:29.960
Something of that style.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.260
is well.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.360
To make us a little idea.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.100
For a higher price, it is

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.220
best to go up.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.980
The Salesforce Company.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.580
He has several licenses.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.860
The highest of all I think is 170

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.280
euros per month per user.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.340
But it includes a lot of functionalities

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.220
that do not have the small ones.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.880
It can vary between that.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.420
Maybe 5 or 10 euros a month.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.220
From a basic to a more advanced one.
