00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.800
Silvia, segmentation at the end of

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.540
the day, the goal of segmentation

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.940
is that it allows you to understand

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.840
your customers very well, but if it

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.620
does not go in line with your product,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.940
your proposal to value, the channels

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.940
through which you arrive, the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.520
messages, that is, if you do not

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.620
adapt to segmentation because

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.100
it does not serve you for

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.620
anything.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.780
And I know that you have an

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.680
example that you did it halfway

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.860
or didn’t get enough to adapt

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.020
and eventually everything failed.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.540
Evidently, in the end this is a subject,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.780
I think in the end the key

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.860
to success is a practice of coherence.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.100
It has to be consistent with everything

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.020
you do both at the level of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.480
product and communication, as well

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.640
as distribution, etc.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.380
And the practical case you comment on is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.660
a case of a product we launched before,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.220
I don’t remember right now, because

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.640
I don’t know if 10 years or 12 years,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.460
that was called ILOVU.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.600
Our goal, once again from the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.400
point of view of the Now we

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.060
want to get into the young people,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.660
who do not want to buy us.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.000
In the end, what you are seeing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.740
is more what your needs with brands

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.800
are, you are not really thinking

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.660
what is what the consumer

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.840
is demanding or will want

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.800
to demand you.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.560
In this particular case, the brand

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.820
said it needed to rejuvenate,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.360
so what do we think we

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.960
should do?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.920
We are going to launch a new

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.180
product for young people.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.640
Then we launched Ilovo.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.720
The name was young, the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.700
communication was more or less

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.920
young, the design was more or less

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.720
young, but neither the price,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.060
nor even the format is really adapted

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.780
to that younger audience and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.620
of course the distribution.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.460
We kept both communication and distribution,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.800
as well as what I commented

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.540
now, as the formats, as

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.960
the rest of our products

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.000
from the rest of the portfolio.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.120
Then at the end we realized that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.500
we were offering a product

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.540
for people probably, that we were

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.720
looking for the 18 or 20 years,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880
because also at that time we were

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.160
still seeing the topic of we

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.080
were still inventing by age, younger

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.400
people in a distribution

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.200
that is used to buying people

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.780
because that from the 40,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.140
with which...

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.540
They are the same selling points you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300
used for, probably along with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.340
the other product of your whole

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.980
life, right?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.600
Of course, then you are going

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.500
only older people or people

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.720
of course who are not adapted to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.100
that type of product, selling

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.840
in addition to a price that was

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.060
not the right for that type of

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.680
product with a communication

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.340
that was still the most classic

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.680
and using the same supports

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.300
we were using.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.520
What are your media advertising?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.920
Is it the case with television and things

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.300
like that?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.100
Exactly the same.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.300
You don’t have to do digital

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.740
marketing.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.440
No, not no

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.460
You have adapted nothing.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.640
We adapt absolutely nothing.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.560
It was phenomenal, wasn’t it?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.540
It was so for us.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.980
and disastrous.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.960
No, but at the end of those good experiences,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.280
of those bad experiences, I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.200
think that at the end of that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.400
is very good because the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.620
learning is much better.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.820
If in this course learning is very clear

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.520
that good several because you have

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.720
introduced one.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.800
First, what you did is not that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.480
there was a customer segment,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.760
not what you wanted to create

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.500
it because you wanted to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.260
rejuvenate the brand, right?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.360
A little behind the customer, right?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.880
in this case.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.160
Yes yes.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.240
That is, whether the studies or

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.920
people were telling you what the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.760
brand had to rejuvenate with which

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760
if or if we had to launch a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.460
product that somehow rejuvenated

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.000
what we had.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.800
And then what happens is that no, the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.640
non-cadence you did not adapt or

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.100
the sufficient value proposal the

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.120
formats, the formats are the sizes,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.600
right?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.620
You did not adapt the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.980
sizes, you adapted the name,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.040
the name mola.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.180
You did not adapt the channels

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.200
through which you reached those

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.280
customers that could perfectly

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.500
be because that for digital channels,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.840
direct sales etc. and you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.100
do not adapt the communications.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.740
Then apart is true that clear at

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.920
those times the ignorance

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.440
there were no studies in any way

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.960
with which you wanted to go to

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.740
a young audience that you had more

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.720
or less a notion that it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720
really is what you were looking

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.760
for but you really didn’t know

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.660
what they were wanting, right?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.200
With which you were giving a little

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.100
blind palos and tried to do an event

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.500
in a party room, a club or you know

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.080
but you were really doing

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.440
things that if you saw that you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.520
had no return immediately because

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.660
like that I stopped doing when

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.700
at best if I had had a continuity

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.940
because at best it would

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.020
have worked but you did not have

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.700
that information that would really

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.880
allow you to adapt to that

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.100
audience because you didn’

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.660
t know it well.
