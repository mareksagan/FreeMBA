WEBVTT

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.070
No is?

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.970
Sometimes it’s not obsessing with what, no,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.210
this will be like that, yes or yes, isn’

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.550
t it?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.190
It’s to be flexible and say, mmm, and according

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.290
to what’s going on you’re going to

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.570
adapt, right?

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.030
That is the product, the proposal, the

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.990
proposal, etc.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.730
Especially in the initial stage of the process.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.430
And it is that the UNESIA told

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.890
me, if this is of transfers, this

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.110
is a real follon.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.730
Half of our students

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.090
are from Asia, for example,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.290
China.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.450
And many of them are called Li or

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.430
Wang or with very similar names, right?

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
Of course, we see transfers and we

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.590
say, and this one belongs to whom?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.250
And sometimes, many times, it is not even

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.690
the student, it is the father or grandfather

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.230
who makes the payment or an uncle.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.850
So, of course, this thing is so stupid,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.770
isn’t it?

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.530
Like when one looks at the card

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.650
extract and says, what is this payment,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.350
right?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.210
As if you multiply this by 5,000

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.470
students, the chaos is absolute,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.170
isn’t it?

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.790
And then, no, then if this, if we

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.130
can’t solve it, it would be interesting.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.630
So what I was almost saying,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.830
please, could you tell your

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.850
students that they would

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.430
use us to send money?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
It turned into, oysters, if we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.490
turn the business and almost what

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.270
we do is make your life easier

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.190
and thanks to you we will reach

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.090
all the students who

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.810
will make payments to you.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.190
So here we have achieved two things.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.670
One is trust.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.570
That is, I don’t have to

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.050
convince a student if it’s not the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.250
UNESIA that is almost telling

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.310
the student to pay through

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.010
the platform.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.730
And then you reduce the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.050
purchase cost greatly.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.970
So you suddenly buy 5,000 instead

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.130
of 1 to 1, right?

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.870
So, in the end, I think this...

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.050
That is, you move from a peer-to-

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.510
peer platform, as you said, to a means

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.390
of payment that connects institutions.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.910
For example, the one who receives the payment

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.570
is the university.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.410
It’s a B2B2C where we sell

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.170
to UNESIA and that channel, right?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.070
The channel bar customer brings us

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.870
to the customer really our end, right?

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.090
In a way where both of them contribute

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.670
to the same.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.630
Then you rely on them, you contribute,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.710
of course, to these institutions

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.850
to capture a lot

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.470
of customers.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.030
So, you a little, if you extrapolate

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.790
it a little, conceptually

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270
it is, you hear, I am thinking

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.090
about the end user client,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.070
but there are ways to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.670
get that are not directly,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.150
they are indirectly.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.850
And if it makes sense, yes, it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.110
reduces my purchase cost, generates

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.430
confidence, etc.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.750
That’s like if PayPal, for

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.250
example, grows into a portal, into

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.130
a new e-commerce that has

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.330
millions of users, then at that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.750
time it’s capturing, it’s gaining

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.610
daily visibility in millions

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.270
of users.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.410
So this makes sense in the end

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.930
when your channel also wins something,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.730
right?

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.270
Ideally is.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.710
Because if you don’t win anything, you’ll

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.730
end up saying, well, so how much do you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.510
pay me for this, right?

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.470
So, it becomes a bit more

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.150
expensive to you if you think

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.290
about acquiring customers.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.970
But do you consider that, for example,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.930
in that case, the university

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750
is your channel or is it a client?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.690
It’s both, because we created a

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.650
solution, a solution because it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.870
simplified life for them, didn’t it?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.550
So basically, the model is that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.850
we give you a little bit of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.750
all the information they need

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.150
to process that payment.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.390
So a bit of the platform I think

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.190
consists in case of use,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.610
right?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.810
You’re going to study in Spain,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.070
at a university abroad, well.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.530
You come to that university and you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.070
say, hear, the tuition is $30,000,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.110
it’s worth it.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.910
So, they would tell you, don’

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.730
t make us a $30,000 transfer.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.670
Go to this, go to this, right?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.250
What do you imagine, is it, right?

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.150
University of Borja.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.690
The Power MBA.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.030
That is, Power MBA or at the time

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.510
was www.peertransfer.com Power MBA

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.330
bar, right?

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.130
And then I would tell you, and where do you come from?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.150
I am from Spain, well.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.630
They will say, don’t send us

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.830
$40,000, send us $30,000.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.270
Then those euros would send us to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.250
a home account, in a home payment

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.650
method that you will feel comfortable

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.330
with.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.170
There is a lot of money

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.270
in the bank that is free,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.850
right?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.790
Or a debit to your account, right?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.810
And then we picked up those euros

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.850
of you, we added them with many

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.870
other students coming, and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.150
then we made a conversion of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.490
euros to dollars at the wholesale

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.150
level.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.910
And with that we have achieved a kind

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.770
of very, very good change.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.350
Part of the money we share with

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.450
the student and part of the money

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.350
we share with the student.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.410
And then those dollars, along with

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.750
many other Korean dollars, Chinese

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.630
dollars, of such, you demand a $10

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.070
million payment to the university

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.350
with the details of all the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.010
payments they needed, right?

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.290
What is the savings for...

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.430
The cost of saving for the user?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.130
The user would be that, about 2 to

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.290
5 percent of the transaction volume.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.750
It is the savings...

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.490
So how much is it?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.130
and yes.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.370
Is the company today...?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.990
Would this be saved compared to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.950
doing it in the traditional way?

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.350
of a bank.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.610
Today, the company is saving

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.670
about 50 million euros a year

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.450
to students from around the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.910
world.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.030
In exchange rates and so

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.110
on.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.430
Are you saving that?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.090
and yes.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.330
I started this business until 2013,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.490
when my first child was born.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.290
I studied a year later in the council.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.090
I am still a shareholder today.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.010
I am not involved in the management

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.050
or administration.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.290
Now, the origins

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.010
of...

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.570
Hear, education payment is a case

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.630
of use for many.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.950
And again to say, well, on this platform

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.950
that I have created for you,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.750
what else can we do?
