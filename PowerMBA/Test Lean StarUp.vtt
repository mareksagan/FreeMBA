WEBVTT

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.780
We will review the correct answers

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.760
of the Lean Startup test.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.600
Lean Startup is created by Eric Rice.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.380
Let us take an example, a fictional case.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.240
We will create a software that allows

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240
us to make attractive presentations.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.480
The idea is that we believe, it

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.600
is the hypothesis, that there are

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.320
millions of people in the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.520
world who are currently using Power

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.020
Point, but one could offer a service

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.100
by leveraging us in the new

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.360
technologies a different service.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.780
But that's the problem, that the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.280
use of Power Point is not optimal.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580
And then the solution is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060
to use an online tool

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.400
with drag and drop,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.200
image banking, etc.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.370
And we believe that the customer

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.210
segment is mainly people in

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.390
the workplace, because clearly

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.830
in the end they have to pay

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.190
for software as a service

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.150
format, and only people who

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.590
are in the workplace, who can

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.810
be either freelance professionals

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050
or small, will pay.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.950
So what is the first thing

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.590
we need to do?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.470
What should we do?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.930
Preparing a business plan with a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.930
for example three-year projection,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.650
identifying the business model

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.830
hypotheses, we have seen some

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.770
by the way, or looking for suppliers.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.150
Most people do what they do,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.230
usually the first thing they

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.390
do is the A and the C.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.950
They start to develop technology

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.250
and also prepare a business

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.110
plan, when what you need to do

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.270
is the B, is to identify the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.370
business model hypotheses

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.550
and then validate them.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.310
What is the first of the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.730
possibilities we need to identify?

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.890
Well, the first is always to identify

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.270
and validate that there is a problem

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.850
and that the problem also

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.770
has a sufficient number

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.390
of people in the world.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.710
If there is no problem, it will

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.810
be very difficult to build a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.910
business model from it.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.150
As we said before, we think there

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.130
are a lot of people in the world

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.550
who would be happy to stop using

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.690
PowerPoint and use our software.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.370
How do you think we can validate it?

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.650
We can make a landing page and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.150
do certain experiments to measure

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.650
what interest is.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.050
We can also make a landing

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.670
page and interview us with 50

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.110
people for example and see how

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.950
they respond.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.690
Or we could also do campaigns on Facebook,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.430
explaining a little about our

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.250
solution and measuring the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.170
result, interest.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.210
All of these are correct

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.890
and I recommend that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.810
you use these tests.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950
We have already validated that there is,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.910
we have validated the problem, we have done

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.170
these experiments and it turns out that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.550
there is some interest.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.710
What would be the next step?

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.330
What do we do?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.570
We create a mockup of the software,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.570
what we do is instead of creating

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.750
the entire software we use some

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.070
tool to create a mockup that

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.910
is like a model that can

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.810
be used.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.430
We either start building the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.730
software or we seek funding.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.810
Well, I would first do as soon as

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.310
possible would create a mockup

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.190
that allows us to interact in the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.690
most real way possible but as soon

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.030
as possible and with the least

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.010
possible investment with customers

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.990
to see what type of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.310
functionality they like, which do

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.370
not like, etc.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.090
And once you have gotten

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.410
conclusions from the mockup, it'

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.370
s when you have to start building

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.390
the software.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.300
When do you think we should

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
build a first version of the software?

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.440
This requires more investment.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.280
When did we validate problem solution

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.080
fit?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.300
In other words, when we have done

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.360
the previous paragraphs we have

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.480
had some success.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.820
When we have obtained enough direct

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.220
feedback from potential customers

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.040
that allows us to know what

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.260
is what we have to build.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.260
When we have validated as much

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.900
as possible that interest

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.140
is large enough to pay for

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.940
it.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.840
Whenever you can, try to validate

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.300
that people will pay for it.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.020
Give them the most real situation possible.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.240
When we are sure that there

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.480
is a large enough market because

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.220
we have validated it on a small

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.640
scale.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.860
All of them are very reasonable.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.560
At that point, if you have done your

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.720
duties well, it is when you have to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.100
start spending money and creating

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.760
the product.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.240
What happens when you don't take care of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.960
the inner startup?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.620
That you are very likely to end

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.560
up building software that no

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.060
one wants.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.560
That we will be without resources

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.860
before reaching product market

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.580
fit because you probably spend

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.740
them on a product that no

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.340
one wants.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.260
When you realize that you no longer

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.540
have enough resources.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.700
Or that we build software

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.600
from ideas in our head

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.140
but not from real

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.880
evidence with customers.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.130
All the previous ones.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.630
I think all the above are consequences

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.010
that will happen to you if you

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.810
have not understood the inner

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.950
startup well and apply it rigorously.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.080
Well, we have already validated

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.980
that we have a product that has

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.320
interest, we have acquired a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.900
sufficient number of customers,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.600
we have controlled something,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.540
we have validated some customer

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.320
acquisition cost and also do

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.900
not give off.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.220
At what point are we?

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.380
I think we have reached

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.000
product market

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.600
fit.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.920
It is at that moment that you

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.560
validate that this has some

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.060
meaning that adds value.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.380
I want to reinforce this Sonelis's

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.420
reflection.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.840
Sonelis what comes to us is that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.120
really the companies that grow most

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.400
are those whose engine is based

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.620
on a very potent product market fit.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.000
That is, the most important thing

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.320
is not how they use the capture

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.940
channels, etc., but that you

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.300
really be able to create a product

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.160
that loves people, that the market

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.020
is waiting for it and sure that

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.900
from that product market fit everything

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.120
goes very well.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.890
Which of the following metrics

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.790
can lead us to error?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.170
Conversion rates, sales volume,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.530
chance rate, the ratio of customers

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.550
that is agreed upon

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.370
in promoters.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.510
Well, it is the volume of sales

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.430
that can lead you to error, because

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.090
it is not really representative

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.790
of the value you are bringing

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.650
the volume of sales.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.730
You have to remember that you

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.650
can do it in some way.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.910
If you're investing a lot

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.290
in marketing, you may have

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.470
high sales, but you may be

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.150
losing customers, for example.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.980
When do you think we

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.100
should start obsessively

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.480
worrying about increasing

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.880
sales and total customer

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.540
volume?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.080
Well, really once we have reached

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.360
product market fit, we have

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.840
clear that we have a product

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.420
that brings value and that people

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.100
like and we have also validated

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.940
and sought the optimization

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.480
of the capture channels.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.360
At that point, we need to start

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.840
investing heavily and worry

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.520
about the absolute volume

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.660
of customers.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.000
Until then, absolute data

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.580
is not so important, it is

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.760
more relative, it is more

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.460
representative metrics of

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.560
what customers like, what

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.020
customers repeat, etc.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.800
Lidl Startup has transformed the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.560
strategic approach with which

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.800
we have to deal with any innovative

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.580
project.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.380
Why is it?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.280
Basically because what it tells us

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.680
is that until we have validated

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.480
all the major hypotheses, what

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.420
we have to have is a look-

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.960
for-look approach, not a run-for-look.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.820
What is the MVP on Dropbox?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.720
and a video.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.500
What are the challenges in the

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.600
growth engine phase?

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.810
Search for the capture channels

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.190
with the lowest CPA.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.830
Yes, find channels that allow

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.870
us to very large volumes,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.270
effectively, and to be clear

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.510
about what will be the fate of

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.590
the growing investments, since

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.670
all the previous ones.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.110
The very low chan rate and a very

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.570
high promoter ratio are very

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.530
representative metrics of what?

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.650
We have a product

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.870
market feed.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.950
The chan rate under what it implies

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.110
is that there are very few customers

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.050
who give us a drop and if the ratio of

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.230
the recommendation is also very high,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.530
it is representative of that.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.000
Why does the total volume of

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.300
sales and the total number

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.780
of customers sometimes give

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.780
us a wrong outlook?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.180
We have explained it before, because

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.320
it can end-up, that is, if you invest

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.380
a lot, you can have many customers,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.380
but it doesn't mean, it'

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.320
s really not directly representative

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.500
of value, because you can be

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.780
capturing many customers,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.000
generating a lot of sales,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.920
but that many are giving down

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.220
and the soil rate is high,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.380
and because sometimes sales

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.000
are not a direct reflection of

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.340
having reached Product Market

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.820
Feed.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.560
I think all three

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.010
are good ideas.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.250
Which of the following decisions

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.410
can lead you to escalate prematurely?

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.550
Investing heavily in marketing

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.890
from the start or over-monitoring

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.570
the chan rate and NPS?

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.950
Clearly it is this.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.490
Until you validate the Product

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.670
Market Feed, the growth channels,

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.270
really the investment

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.550
in marketing does not have

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.690
to go targeted to growth,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.470
it has to go aimed at getting

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.730
enough customers to be able

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.870
to go learning.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.950
What is the main cause of a

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.670
startup's death?

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.910
Create a product that no one

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.670
wants to buy.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.890
When do you think it is

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.110
appropriate to make a business plan?

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.870
From the beginning, to be able

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.990
to plan the entire development of the

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.590
business model, or when you have

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.270
managed to validate the business

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.450
model hypotheses, then we already

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.090
know what will happen, or we already

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.610
have more guarantees of

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.810
what will happen, and at that time

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.110
it is when we project it

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.030
into the future.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.470
Who is Lean Startup for?

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.610
Lean Startup is a methodology

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.930
that everyone needs to know

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.050
and that must be used in

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.950
managing all organizations

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.110
regardless of whether they

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.610
are large or small.
