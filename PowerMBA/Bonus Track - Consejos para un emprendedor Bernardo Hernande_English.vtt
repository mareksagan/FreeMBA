00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.660
Bernardo, there are millions of people

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.640
in this world who are not

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
happy with their work situation,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.380
who dream of being an entrepreneur,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.060
in many cases they only dream of

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.180
it because they never give the

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.540
pass, and of those who give the

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.660
pass, in addition, many,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.920
by pure statistics, many fail,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.540
fail at first, not even are able

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.500
to take forward their project,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.260
which is a pity because

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.000
many resources are lost, people

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.840
suffer a lot, etc.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260
What advice would you give

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.320
to any of our students who are

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.740
in that situation, who want

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.700
to take the first step?

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.660
The first thing you have...

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.880
I would tell you three things.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.360
The first is that they are

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.280
convinced that they really want

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.980
to do this and that not only

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.120
a dream, that they have the real motivation

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.660
to want to build something big

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.880
and to make the effort, will probably

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.440
be the most difficult thing they

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.680
do in their life, being an entrepreneur

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.600
is very, very, very difficult.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.080
It is an adventure often alone,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
with a leadership both emotional

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.200
and technical, as strategic,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.300
very important, where it will require

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.940
an extraordinary effort

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.100
on the part of the person

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.260
and they have to be aware.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.220
I think that the entrepreneur is

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.400
not born, I think that we can

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.140
all be entrepreneurs, but you have

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.680
to be aware, many times you are

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.780
not aware, but you have to be

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.920
willing to make the effort

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.500
that will require.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.480
I would tell anyone who has the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.260
motivation that it is not a job

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.300
option, it is a life option.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.400
How do you perceive the fact that, I’ve

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
seen it many times, there are people

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.640
who fall in love with maybe too

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.560
much of their idea?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.320
It seems that the world stops and that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.420
they have the idea with which they

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.200
will solve the most important

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340
problem and sometimes lose objectivity.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060
Have you met such people?

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.080
I have always said to myself

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.580
that you should love the problem,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.260
not the solution.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.320
In the test, our egos tend to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.100
think that the solution

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.480
we have found to a problem

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.300
is unique.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.080
And you have to fall in love with

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.320
the problem and not the solution,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.580
have the sucking humility

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.660
to recognize that maybe your

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.020
approach is not the right one

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.900
and that you are doing that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.060
to solve a problem, not to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.260
show the world how ready you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140
are, but to solve a problem.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.760
It is important to remember it and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.740
always recognize it.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.860
This is a very important issue

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.240
because I have seen entrepreneurs

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.340
who don’t end up having failure

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.700
is fundamentally a matter

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.260
of ego.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.840
Being a successful entrepreneur is

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.040
that fine balance between having

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.520
a very strong personality, with

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.600
a very strong ego, that makes

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.740
you face very serious challenges,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.460
but at the same time the sucking

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.160
waist and humility as to recognize

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.860
when you are wrong and change.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.900
Then that balance between not

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.480
being too weak to be constantly

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.020
changing, because then you will

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.600
take the breath to a wind, not

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.740
too stubborn as not to be flexible

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.860
to change when you have

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.640
to do so.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.860
And that belt, that balance is very

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.440
complicated.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.840
I’ve already told you that I’ve seen

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.560
many entrepreneurs who have failed

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.800
because they’ve been very weak and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.080
have thrown the towel immediately, or

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.060
others because they’re too dull and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.700
believe they’re more smart than the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.720
rest of the people and crash against

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.460
a wall 200 kilometers away...

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.640
Even though everyone is leaving them...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes, but when...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.420
One characteristic of entrepreneur

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.160
is that, it is the opposite,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.180
it is the ability to go with the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.680
counter-current.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.320
So many people who grow up, when

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.820
more they say no, no, no, no,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.800
the most convinced is.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.560
Then the line between timidity

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.100
and being brave and bravery

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.760
is very fine.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.440
What advice would you give them about associating

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.600
with more people or not going alone

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.400
or what to look for in accompanying?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.960
In this line I just said,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960
being accompanied

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.000
helps a lot.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.760
If you are able to have the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.860
generosity of integrating a partner,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.700
you are demonstrating a skill

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.420
of being able to understand the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.640
world differently, and that helps,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.540
not only because you have 50% of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.920
the load, but because you have

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.340
someone next to you who is complementing

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.200
you and intellectually challenging

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.700
that that’s fine.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.640
It complements you.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.760
In addition, I think it is convenient

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.620
to look for people who are

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.440
not exactly the same as you, that

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.940
generate some synergy in the team.
