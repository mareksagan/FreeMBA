00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.260
The aim of this class is to

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.280
acquire a strategic vision of

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.420
marketing and the different

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.040
models, concepts, tools, etc.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700
that are integrated or englobated

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.860
within marketing.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.420
There are many models that will sound

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.680
to you, sure you will sound the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.460
four OPs of the marketing mix, you

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.240
will sound concepts like positioning,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.400
such as segmentation, etc.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.980
But it is interesting that we

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.620
understand, from a more strategic

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.460
or earlier perspective in

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.480
many cases, how all the pieces

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.580
fit.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.180
Because it's really a marketing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.720
plan, whether what we're creating

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.200
is the zero proposal or the zero

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.080
plan, we should consider all these

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.860
steps, we should understand

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.860
what the relationships between

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.100
one and the other are.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.580
By the way, marketing professionals,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.800
especially if they work

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.260
in large companies, usually

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.800
focus their work on some

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.780
of the more operational

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.940
or tactical parts.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.840
For example, imagine the P of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.120
marketing mix promotion, in

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.300
giving to know.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.580
Or maybe they are in pricing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.520
or in product issues, etc.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.000
But you'll only have the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.800
chance to really design everything

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.420
from the top if you're the most

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.680
responsible or if you're creating

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.260
a new product, a new service

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.020
or if you're an entrepreneur,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.080
for example.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.580
The first thing I'm going to do

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.820
is share with you a model that is

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.540
STP, which is segmentation,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.660
targeting and positioning, which

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.880
is ultra-known.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.080
It has to sound this, although it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.180
is true that it is more known in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.880
the American business

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.060
schools than in Spain or Latin America.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.640
It is a model that describes

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.800
the phases in the strategic

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.840
marketing process.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.740
And we added two phases to it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.000
because we believe we have enriched it.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.280
And we have the following model,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.920
segmentation, targeting, customer

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.000
person, positioning and marketing

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.760
mix.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.560
The first thing I will do is to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.060
divide this model into two blocks.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.160
The first thing is to decide who we are

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.760
going to address, not only to decide

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.160
who but more to know him well.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.900
And this how do we do it?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.260
We do it with targeting,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.240
we do it with

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.100
customer person.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.580


00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680
And then what we will do is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.220
decide how we will target

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.660
that segment or those segments

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.200
that we have decided to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.060
be our targets.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.460
Here comes the marketing

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.420
mix.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.480
We start with segmentation.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.500
Segmentation consists of, from the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.240
entire market to which we could be

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.100
directed, from the entire market or

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.980
target audience, dividing it into

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.760
different segments or homogeneous groups.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.700
And how will we do it?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.020
We will do this by using

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.160
a series of criteria

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.940
or segmentation variables.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.960
We see this in detail in the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
Customer Centric module.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.540
They are geographical

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.040
or demographic by age, gender,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.600
etc.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500
Psychology by Profile.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.140
We can use criteria such as,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.860
I don't know, conservatives,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.060
cosmopolitan, etc.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.680
urban and rural.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.500
The behavioral variables

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.960
that we do is use criteria

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.520
or segment based on the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.620
interactions you have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.440
had with us.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.200
I give you an extreme example.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960
We can segment into two large segments

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.100
based on the fact that they have already

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.100
bought us and we adapt everything

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.280
that comes after to those who

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.060
have bought us and those who have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.160
not bought us, customers and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.800
not customers, so that you have

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.360
the idea.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.140
And the last of the variables and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.420
the most important is to segment

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.960
according to what are

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.180
the problems or needs that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.920
the different segments seek in us.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.060
Then what we do is use the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.900
five criteria or those that correspond

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.500
to you and you determine

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.420
segments.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.080
The next step is targeting.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.240
It is up to us to decide which of

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.680
these segments we will be addressing.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.260
By the way, the reality is that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.480
segmentation and targeting

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.360
are done unified in reality.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.860
Although they are two distinct stages

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.980
in theory, when you are segmenting

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.100
in the bottom, you are already

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.500
deciding who you want to address.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.440
What criteria can we use to decide

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.540
within all the segments that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.780
exist which ones we will be addressing

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.440
or which ones interest us?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.000
You can use common

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.840
sense.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.060
You have resources

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.140
to access them.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.800
If we have made a geographical segmentation

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.980
and one of the segments is China,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.380
and it can also be a giant, super

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.560
interesting segment, but

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.260
it is that we can't get

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.420
there, it is that it's a very

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.620
simple criterion.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.180
Another reason is that this

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.900
segment is growing.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.700
It has a potential for growth or

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.800
is profitable.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.840
And one very important one is, within

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.220
that segment, how is the competitive environment?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.180
There is more or less competition.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.540
Will we be able to be competitive

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.220
in this segment?

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.800
This is often a very important

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.500
criterion.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.280
Do you recognize that there is

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.960
a potential in a particular area?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.920
But there are very strong competitors.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.520


00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.780
Better to play something else.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.120
In this phase of targeting, here

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.640
they apply concepts or models that,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.200
for example, the DAFO.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.460
We analyze our strengths, weaknesses,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.100
threats and opportunities.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.720
And that will help us a little

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.660
to decide which segments

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.040
we can go to.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.300
A model for scaling the market

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.980
or each of those segments.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.860
As for the Samsung TAM, we will

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.040
see it in detail.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.760
Well, we have already classified the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.460
total market into a number of segments.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.960
We also know which areas

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.280
are most important to us.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.720
The next thing we have to do is, we

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.780
have to understand them very well.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.760
We need to turn those targets into

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.140
real people.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.040
We use the Customer

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.680
Persona tool.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.280
We see it in detail in the

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.360
Customer Centric module.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.780
We put him face and eyes,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.180
describe what he does, what he thinks,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.940
with whom he relates, what social networks

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.140
he consults, etc.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.520
Well, we already have clear who we are going

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.700
to address and how it is.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.440
This is very important to do well.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.280
It is really the basis of success.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.140
And then, let's see how we

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.560
will address that Customer

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.520
Persona.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.540
Our customers are those who

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.340
are our goals.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.960
Here we enter the positioning phase.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.920
It's more strategic than marketing

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.540
mix.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.380
Positioning is basically deciding

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.220
what place we want to occupy in

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.500
the minds of our target audience.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.260
This is very dependent on

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.940
competition.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.300
In many cases, it will be the hole

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.560
that leaves you competition.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.160
Competition already exists.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.720
Are there tools or models that are

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.160
related to the positioning?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.220
Again the Dafa.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.600
As we say, we have to see

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.780
what the gap leaves the competition.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.640


00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.620
Concepts such as competitive advantage.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.840
Or the differentiation.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.100
We also talk about branding.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.420
We need to create a

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.920
brand.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.160
The brand is closely related

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
to positioning.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.700
How do we want to position

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.100
our brand in the market?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.000
All the existing brands.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.840


00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.080
How do we position it?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.620
What hole do we want our brand

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.200
to occupy in the mind of consumers?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.280
The positioning is very

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.080
strategic.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.340
Branding is very strategic.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.740
Then we go to the most operational level.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.820
This is the marketing mix.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.040
It is the famous model of the

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.500
four P's.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.280
conditioned by the above.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.060
We are determining the product,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.160
the price.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.840
How we will introduce

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.320
our customers.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.540
How we will get to them.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.320
The product.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.380
For example, the product or

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.280
product list.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.180
This is the model of the Boston

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.220
Consulting Group.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.160
We will see.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.840
You need to understand the product'

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.500
s life cycle.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.020
That's another model we've met.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.020
The pricing strategies.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.300
As for promotion.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.560
We talk about advertising, etc.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.320
or distribution channels.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.640
How we will reach our customers.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.920
As you can see, this is the last

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.980
of the stages.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.620
That's what they usually

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.440
work on.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.140
People and professionals.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.940
Related to marketing.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.080
They work on marketing

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.740
mix.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.300
But it is important that we understand.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.800
It all comes from a

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.340
previous strategic planning.
