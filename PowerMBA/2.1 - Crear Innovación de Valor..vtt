WEBVTT

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.320
Carlos, so that our students can better

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.900
understand the concept of value innovation

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
and how to use the RICE

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.920
matrix, I think there are some

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.420
cases that are very illustrative

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.480
and I will ask you to explain

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.300
them to us.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.020
The first is curves, the gymnastics

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.060
curves.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.960
Tell us briefly what it consists

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.840
of and how you have managed to generate

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.960
this so differentiated proposal.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.880
Well, because curves is a good

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720
example of value innovation

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.160
thinking in the women's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.800
customer segment.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.540
Curves are female gyms only for

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.460
women, in which they adapted

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.340
their value proposal to bring

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.280
the greatest possible value to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520
the segment, for women, while

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.320
making an innovation in value

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.500
containing the things associated

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.360
with the launch and operation

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.820
of this type of gyms.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.780
How can they reduce costs?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.960
Well, they can reduce costs

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.440
because being a gym only for

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.160
women, some aspects such

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.260
as dressing rooms, services,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
coaches are reduced.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.260
They also reduce costs because

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.320
the model, as we will see

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.020
when we talk about value, is

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.560
a model based on everything

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.940
happening on a small area, in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.620
a circle, so that the square meters

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.180
a gym requires curves is much

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.540
smaller than a traditional gym.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.300
And they also reduce costs because

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.080
the type of machines that this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.160
gym uses for curved women

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.060
also requires a much lower investment.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.240
Clarissim, clarissim, is that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.540
you see, seeing a gym curves, you

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.360
see clearly that the machinery is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840
simpler, it is all simpler and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.160
smaller locations, etc.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.480
And how do you get to increase

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.200
value thinking about this segment

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.260
of customers that are women?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
Indeed, the magnificent thing

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.020
about this example is that in

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.240
addition to having reduced costs,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.420
as we have seen, it has greatly increased

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.760
the perceived value for

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.320
the segment, for women, obviously

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.720
not for other segments

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.800
because it is a gym only

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.560
for women.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.460
The mere fact that it is only for women

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.260
I understand that it adds value to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.040
the segment.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.920
Women go to the gym more focused

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.580
on exercising and therefore the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.820
one that only women, since from

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.040
a point of view of intimacy

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.180
and others, possibly provides

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.080
a lot of value.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.460
It brings value because everything

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.060
happens, as we said, in a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.800
circle, in a relatively

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.400
small room and in a circle in such

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.620
a way that while we exercise

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.980
we are doing networking

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.380
or relationships with other women.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.720
And it also adds value to thinking

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.980
about women because in curves

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.160
all the exercise you do two

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.940
or three times a week happens

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.500
in 30 minutes, unlike traditional

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.420
gyms where we normally

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.060
have to be an hour, hour

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.960
and a half.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.280
Well, I would tell you that in

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.460
the traditional gyms, in addition to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.120
time, they don't give you it

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.740
packaged, that is, they don't give you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.240
a solution of, in addition to that it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.420
little time, that's very efficient, this

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.660
reminds me a little of The Power MBA,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.240
more efficient, in the case of curves

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.200
is that they give you the closed

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.900
format, it's not like you have

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.240
to go there to see what's there.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.760
30 minutes you change the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.220
machine and you make your table,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.040
to say somehow, in just 30 minutes,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.900
with which it is very compatible

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.400
for women working, escape

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.420
at noon, a little curves,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.240
eat fast and go back

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.180
to work.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.400
Therefore, pure value for the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.940
segment while reducing in costs.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.560
A great example of value innovation.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.740


00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.860
It is clear.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.620
Tell us, we will see with the curve

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.340
too and with the Madrid-

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.000
Rice, how is the value innovation

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.880
of yogurt stores these that have

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.840
grown in the last five years

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160
competing with traditional

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.000
ice cream stores.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.980
Is it Mui?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.600
It is one of the chains that has grown the most.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.680
Mui is a ice cream store

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.260
that may seem Nordic by

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.060
its name, but it is from Murcia.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.860
It has more than 150 locations in Spain

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.180
and has grown very quickly with

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.700
a strong differentiation because

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.800
it has known to find for the customer

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.300
segment, young people, the same

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.360
that goes to this type of establishments,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.540
a strong differentiation in

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540
value, providing a differentiation

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.940
in the value proposal at the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.340
same time that has gone with

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.020
a strong cost reduction.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.400
If we see the strategic picture and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.520
beyond the price, that I think there

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.640
is a variety in this type of establishments

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.360
very high, I would say that it

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.960
is Mui is in an intermediate

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.400
range, is not relevant therefore

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.800
its lower price differentiation.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.320


00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.220
No, basically here the price for what

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.300
we see is the same, a ice cream is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.580
the same as a yogurt of these, but

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.000
what happens is that of course, the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.400
cost of production is lower.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.560
I would say graphically, as

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.340
we can see in the image, they are

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.320
two absolutely opposite value

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.160
curves, where a traditional ice cream

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.420
store has an enormous variety

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.020
of flavors of all kinds, which

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.460
we could imagine in the Mui only

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.920
we find a ice cream, nothing

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.800
more.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.460
The variation will be achieved

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.200
by other variables.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.840
Where traditional ice cream stores

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.240
have a strong craftsmanship,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.680
in the case of S-Mui we are

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.340
talking about an absolutely

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.320
industrial product and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.520
produced in a massive way.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.400
In exchange, that is, we have

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.600
the design of the stores in the traditional

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.440
life, it is not only important

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.160
in S-Mui, it is where they have been

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.660
able to invest and differentiate

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.280
with that image so peculiar

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.560
of this chain of yogurt

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.100
or ice cream stores.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.680
Likewise, the location in large

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.860
shopping centers that ensure

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220
a customer traffic, a strong investment

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.180
in brand image and then some

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.420
concepts that have just rounded

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.980
up that differentiation

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.980
of the value proposal.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.360
It is an easy product to choose

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.560
because we only have a variety

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.040
in which we differentiate

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.500
it through toppings that helps

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.780
a lot to personalize the product

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.000
and also to make superior

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.200
product sales.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.900
And have learned to invest

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.580
in a healthy product concept, being

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.640
a less crafty product, less

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.940
possibly more industrial than a

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.160
traditional ice cream store,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.760
this concept of ice cream yogurt

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.880
have known to consider

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.140
it as a healthy product

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.580
and therefore a perception

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.360
of value.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.540
The truth is that seeing this

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.560
Carlos, listening to you, is that now

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.500
we understand the huge growth that

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.340
these competitors of ice cream shops

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.480
have had, because it is that in the

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.780
value curve you see absolutely,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.880
the cost of production is

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.840
much lower because it is

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.280
less craftsman, you only have

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.720
one product, etc.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.420
Then you add more value.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.660
And indeed a lot of people, there

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.400
is a ice cream shop next to

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.720
a yogurt shop and choose the yogurt

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.420
shop whatever it is, because

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.100
what you say you are easier to choose,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.680
because children like the toppings

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.180
and because it is healthy,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.820
etc.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.680
Well very clear.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.780
They have learned to choose the variables

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.020
to invest that have actually allowed

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.740
them to grow against others

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.900
that possibly do not provide a

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.900
relevant value for the segment.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.900
actually is.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.980
Motel One, tell us.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.360
Well, Motel One is another magnificent

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.060
example of value innovation.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.540
We are talking about a German

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.260
hotel chain with a few dozen

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.240
establishments in Europe and

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.000
in clear expansion that what

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.960
has started is to define a market

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.740
segment that I think was

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.640
little exploited.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.620
And it's young people, usually

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.580
couples with limited purchasing

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.320
power, but who don't want

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.580
to give up a series

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.660
of confusing features when

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.780
traveling.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.540
Every time you travel more, this

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.300
segment travels more, but they are

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.300
used to a number of advantages

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.160
that they do not want to give up.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.400
If we see the strategic picture

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.900
of Motel One, we basically see

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.020
that in the face of the alternative

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.760
of a costly four or five-star hotel

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.880
or a cheap three-star hotel but

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.960
with very limited services,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.900
Motel One takes the best of each

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.900
of them thinking again in the

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.880
segment and trying to shed, aquilating

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.260
costs in those aspects that

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.720
are not relevant to the

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.600
young people segment with

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.320
limited purchasing power and

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.600
investing in those variables

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.660
not excessively costly

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.700
but that do provide a huge

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.460
perception of value in the

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.420
segment.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.060
As you can see in the picture, where

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.780
did you deinvest or where did you

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.200
save costs Motel One?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.780
Often, it's a hotel and a

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.380
person in the reception who

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.820
sells you a bottle of water

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.160
at any time of the day

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.680
or solves a question

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.920
or even serves you a Coca-

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.380
Cola in the afternoon.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.200
Services are very limited, common

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.460
areas are generally limited to

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.200
a wide reception where almost

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.780
everything happens, breakfast,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.780
check-in, a conversation

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.260
with a beer in the afternoon,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.520
etc.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.920
The size of the rooms, are logically

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.940
rooms of a small size, that

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.980
is, in exchange for modern,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.080
clean, etc.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.560
In amenities, gel, this type

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.200
of accessories we usually put, because

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.620
it is the fact that each one

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.140
of us travels with them and

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.160
is a way to save.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.120
That is, where he has invested,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.540
strongly, to really capture that

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.960
market segment.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.120
In design, they are hotels with

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.940
a very modern design, minimalist,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.200
in the location, they are hotels

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.140
well situated for this type of tourism

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.920
and everything that has to do in

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.200
general with technology, online

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.900
reservations, check-in and

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.200
check-out through the smartphone

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.340
with a quality internet application

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.800
and technology in the

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.160
rooms, etc.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.980
Definitely a magnificent value

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.980
proposal, a cost and an unbeatable

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.920
price for this segment that'd

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.980
fit people at 60 or 70

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.160
with a high purchase price

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.120
than what they want is

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.640
a traditional 4- or 5-star

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.840
hotel.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.180
The truth is that I love it

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.120
too, above all, it is very easy to

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.280
understand if we compare it with

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.820
the 2 and 3 star hotels, because

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.880
the price is the same.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.960
As you say, the price is the same.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.740
But of course, what they do is, Model

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.500
One, with respect to the 2 or

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.360
3 stars, decrease the investment in

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.480
personnel, in services, in which the

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.200
common areas are, you do not need in

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.620
many cases because you will almost

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.420
just sleep, that the common zones

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.260
are the minimum expression, etc.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.760
You will be able to use the gel,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.900
shampoo and so on.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.460
But what it does in return is,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.520
as does the 2 or 3 star

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.700
hotels, in many cases young

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.700
people may not square the design

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.560
or are not located where they

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.400
want, Model One invests

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.160
in that.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.280
They are very modern hotels,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.060
aesthetically very attractive, that

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.820
although the rooms are small,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.280
in the end the feeling is very

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.680
good.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.820
And then that include the services

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.220
that we demand young people

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.580
depends on speed, technology,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.580
etc.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.620
It's not the best value

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.280
proposal we could think of

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.920
for a hotel, but it's the

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.020
best hotel value proposal

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.040
for the customer segment we've

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.100
mentioned.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.980
Actually, very good case.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.200
Thank you very much Carlos, very interesting.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.980
thanks to.
