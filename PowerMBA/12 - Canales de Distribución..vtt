00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.020
Today we will talk about the distribution channel.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.400
It is one of the most important

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.680
blocks within the business model and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.800
therefore it is necessary to understand

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.720
it very well.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.880
This class is really simple because

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.020
they are pretty obvious things and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.860
I imagine that many of the concepts

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.920
you will already know, but it'

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.500
s okay to refresh it.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.180
What we're going to do is, in addition

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.460
to identifying the types of channels

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.420
there, we're going to try

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.220
to analyze what the pros and cons

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.900
of each of the channel types

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.320
are.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560
Let us take the example of the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.320
wine industry.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's use the example of Vintai,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.100
which is a company you already know.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.580
Why do I use the wine industry?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.260
Well, because the wine sector

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.640
channel is a very similar channel

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.880
to many others.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.140
What we have on screen is the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.060
wine industry's supply

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.600
chain.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.160
Supply chain is a concept you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.320
have to understand, but it's a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.860
very obvious and very simple

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.900
concept.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.320
It is the chain that goes from raw

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.820
materials to the final consumer,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.540
which, as you see, between mediums

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.420
there are different companies,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280
processes, operations, but everything

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.280
is linked.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.620
Well, two types of distribution

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.740
channels or two types

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.240
of channel strategy mainly.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.060
We could set more rankings,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.120
but I think this is the most

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.600
important one and you have

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.740
to understand well.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.440
And it is that you can opt for direct

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.300
sales, by a direct channel, that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.340
is, that you with your media

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.700
direct to the final consumer.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.060
Or you can choose an indirect

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700
channel, which in many sectors is the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.460
most common, and is that you rely

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.740
on companies that are intermediaries

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.860
between you, in this case the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.220
producer that is Vintai, the cellar,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040
and the final consumers

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.100
branches of wine.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.880
Let us begin by analyzing for the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300
case of Vintai, what would be the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.160
links of this indirect channel.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240
Well, first we have a channel

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.080
that in this sector is called distributor

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.440
and in other sectors is called

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.480
wholesale.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.840
And as you can see, I have drawn,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.640
I have chosen the icon of a truck,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.100
because one of the values it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.560
brings is logistics.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.880
In this case, they are companies

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.240
that distribute Vintai and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.620
other brands, other beverages,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.020
and have a relationship,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.900
imagine, with the restaurant

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.780
channel or with the specialized

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.580
store channel, for example.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.580
This is the wholesale channel, it provides

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.800
a value mainly logistically and gives

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.260
you capilarity, because each distributor

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080
has many customers who are

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.860
those restaurants.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.500
The retail channel is called

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.340
the retail channel, which is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.340
called different forms in different

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.440
sectors.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.120
What would this channel be in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.800
the wine sector?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.980
You will understand well.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.580
Well, then the ORECA channel,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400
hotels, restaurants, etc.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.760
The channel of the large distribution,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.460
supermarkets, e-commerce, and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.820
we could also incorporate the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.580
specialized stores, which

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.260
do not enter any of the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.420
above sections.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.160
As you can see, we are englobating

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.640
in this channel the last sling before

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.880
reaching the final consumer.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.300
Now, we go to the direct sales

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.640
channel.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.420
As I said, this is when

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.960
you go directly to the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.840
end consumer.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.900
In the case of cellars, I think

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.620
this is quite residual, direct

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.540
sale is residual.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.540
But well, for some example, I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.740
would tell you that the wine they

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.060
sell, the cellars, in the cellar

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.160
itself, if you are going to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.460
visit, etc.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.060
That is direct selling.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.020
Or if the cellars have, for

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.200
example, an e-commerce own, if

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.860
you can buy directly on their website,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.840
in this case it is not so.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.260
If you can, it could also

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.000
be considered a direct sale.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.360
Well, I think it's very easy to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.380
rank direct sales when you're targeting

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.140
the end consumer, or indirect

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.000
sales when you rely on intermediaries.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.280


00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.140
Until now, it is very easy,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.800
what I would like to do is

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.500
to analyze what are the advantages,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.560
pros and cons of both strategies.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.140
And we will do it from the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.720
perspective of indirect sale.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.730
The classification of direct

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.970
and indirect channels is very

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.450
simple, as I have said, it is dependent

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.030
on intermediaries or not.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.170
But the interesting thing

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.190
is that we analyze what

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.630
are the advantages, pros and cons

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.010
of each of the strategies.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.810
Let's start with the channel.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.750
I would say the main thing about

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.990
the indirect channel is that it allows

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.590
you to have much more reach and faster.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.970
This allows you to reach

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.250
many more customers in a simpler

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.950
way.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.390
And it also allows you to do so without

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.710
having to invest in many key

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.930
resources.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.590
It is a little like.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.470
The conclusion of this is that you are

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.710
more scalable with the indirect

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.950
channel, because you can grow very

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.270
fast without having to make a lot

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.790
of additional investments.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.370
This also facilitates the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.890
simplicity of operations.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.910
Because you can focus on your core

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.690
activity, which in the case of

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.510
a cellar is to make wine.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.310
If you also have to dedicate yourself

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.250
to marketing to the final

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.310
consumer, you want to enter

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.330
the next slopes, because

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.710
obviously the management of

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.390
the company is complicated.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.410
So far we have seen benefits.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.990
But there are also certain traps, obviously,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.890
and it is the indirect channel

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.170
that keeps you away from the end consumer.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.610
It makes you lose some control.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.670
It is true that companies

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.410
try to be close to the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.650
end consumer, get feedback,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.310
etc.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.530
But it is clear that by having

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.210
intermediaries you lose some proximity,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.490
you lose feedback, you lose

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.830
information, which in many cases

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.290
is very valuable.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.370
And on the other hand, obviously,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.310
the fact that you rely

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.390
on intermediaries who make money

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.430
and apply a margin, makes

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.090
your margin on final sales

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.350
lower, obviously.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.430
Because the price of sale to the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.030
channel, to the distributor, is much

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.610
lower, obviously, than that of the

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.510
final consumer.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.490
Now go to the channel.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.570
The direct channel has disadvantages

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.030
that are just the opposite.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.290
First, to grow you need more resources.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.550
You need to make more investments, of course.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.330
If you want to grow at the same rate

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.590
through a direct channel as an

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.630
indirect one, imagine the

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.010
investments you have to make

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.810
to have all that reach.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.370
On the other hand, as an advantage is that

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.470
you are very close to the final consumer,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.850
you get feedback that does not pass

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.450
through the filter of other

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.850
companies or other people.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.230
This is a problem that I, as

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.310
a strategic consultant,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.210
have found in a lot

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.450
of companies.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:59.930
I always say that companies, especially

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.090
the big ones, many of whom I'

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.850
ve worked with, are too

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.450
far from the end consumer.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.870
It is an incredible thing.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.150
But of course, if you rely on other

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.130
companies that are in the middle,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.550
then you already imagine it.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.310
Well, and as a benefit of the direct

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.110
channel is that your margins are larger.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.310
Obviously because you get the margin

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.590
of intermediation that your

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.110
distributors would be charging.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.410
Thanks for watching the video.
