00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.840
This class is very important, and

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.840
I have an important challenge and it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.180
is that, really, I would like to

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.040
convince you that going out to

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.820
the market with a minimum viable

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.200
product has very many benefits compared

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.800
to doing it in the traditional way.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.380
What happens is that the minimum

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.600
viable product is, despite being a

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.980
word that everyone reads daily, very

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.300
few people understand it well and much

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.400
less people are still able to apply

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.300
it or when you see in the fabric

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.160
of creating an innovative project,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700
because it is difficult to apply

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.260
the rajatabla, the philosophy read

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.820
and go out to the market with

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.900
a minimum viable product because,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.980
as we will see, there are

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.060
many resistances, especially

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.660
mental resistances that we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940
have to overcome.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.820
Let us start by looking at the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.400
process of traditional product development.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.280
The first thing he does is,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.320
in a startup he is the founder,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200
what he does is conceptualize,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.960
shape that product, that

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.680
service, what are the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160
functionalities, specifications,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.320
what is what he has to do,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920
how he has to behave, etc.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.520
And from there, some requirements,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.680
these specifications,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480
are passed to the technical

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.260
equipment, which can be programmers

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.380
or engineers, depending

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.100
on the type of product.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.360
This is the longest phase, which usually

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.740
lasts a few months and is also the phase

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.220
that consumes the most money.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.040
Before the product is released,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040
a beta testing is

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.940
carried out.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.800
What happens is that the product is

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.560
almost finished, that is, you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.600
have already spent the money and a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.780
lot of time has passed.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.840
And what you do is, before you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.760
launch it, well, because it is validated

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.880
in a large company with the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.720
different departments, or you make

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300
a focus group, you have some feedback

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.560
from customers, although it is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.620
already too late.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.920
But it’s also a feedback that

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.960
doesn’t usually work.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.720
And finally, what is done is to

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.160
throw it.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640
It is important that you take into

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.040
account, because if you have seen yourself

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840
in the situation it has gone by safe and if

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.380
it will not happen to you, and it is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.600
that there is a lot of tendency to make

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.120
the product more complex.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.960
As it develops, well, because

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.100
we all get ideas, no, because

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.220
I’m going to put this new functionality

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.620
in, it would be good if

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.700
I did this, no, it should

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.740
be a little smaller, a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.500
little bigger, etc.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.980
So what we do is to make it more

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.520
and more complex, more time,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.600
more money, and so on.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.900
This also extends the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.880
launch date.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600
But well, the main problem here, seeing

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.740
that process, is that this process

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.700
has already been born wrong.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.640
Why is?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.500
Because the first stage, which

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.640
is when we have shaped that product,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.840
we have made a lot of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.000
mistakes, because to start with

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.600
we are giving of course that we

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.160
know what the product we have

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.200
to build, which is a huge mistake,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.440
because we are assuming that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.120
we know how the customer

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
will behave.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.060
So the traditional product

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.260
development process is already

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.240
about to fail.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.180
What is the Instartup?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.120
As you know, well, because it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120
proposes a different process in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.140
which product development is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.880
also very different and we call

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.380
it the minimum viable product.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.180
As you know we start from a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.680
hypothesis and what we do is instead

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.200
of giving of course all the product

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.720
specifications, what we do is to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.740
go out to the market with the least

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.220
viable product and with the simplest

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.940
possible, well, and we will go

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.220
obtaining information

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.780
and we will go building

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.220
and we will get a perfect product,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.760
but we still do not know

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.140
what it is.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.240
So what is the minimum viable

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.020
product?

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.380
It is the minimum version of your

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.480
product, the minimum, with the least

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.000
possible functionality, the less, the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.360
better, but that allows you to learn,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.040
that allows you to advance in

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.980
that process.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.760
Therefore, there is also implicit

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.260
what must be feasible.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.600
What is it mean to be viable?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.320
Well, then to have a certain

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.340
value so that customers are willing

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.440
to interact with him, to pay

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.480
for him, etc.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.000
Because otherwise you can’t learn anything,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.360
if you have a product that doesn’t

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.220
bring any value to anyone, you can’

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.140
t learn anything.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.560
It is very important that you always

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.500
keep in mind, that you never forget,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.240
during the time you are developing

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.420
the product, that less

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.100
is more.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.700
As I said, we all have a

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.240
tendency to become more

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.620
and more complex.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.060
The simpler, the better.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.100
Per this picture is quite illustrative

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.420
of what can be a minimum

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.300
viable product.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.620
What is your vision?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.080
Well, because your view is the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.040
dollar of the right.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.520
However, what you do is, as it will

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.040
take you time and money to develop

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.220
that final product, what you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.560
do is go to the market with a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.700
product that is viable, because

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.240
people want to buy it.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.560
Maybe it’s not what you have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.740
in your head yet, but let’s

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.460
see why.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.780
You will start getting feedback from

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.580
those customers and will allow you

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.580
to build the product.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.700
And in the end, maybe your product is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.020
the one you had in your head or not.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.700
Let’s see what are the clear

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.220
benefits of coming out to the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.060
market with a minimum viable product.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.200
The first, which you already know, is

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.120
that it allows us to quickly

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.880
validate the hypotheses.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.340
The possibilities of our business model.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.640
We have seen this with the Zappos case.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.420
Zappos did what it did is go

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.840
out to the market in the first

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.940
week, since the founder was

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.280
minded of the idea, to validate

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.820
that customers were willing to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.120
buy shoes in an e-commerce.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.400
And if you remember, what Zappos

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.100
did was create a very simple website,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.520
but he hadn’t stocked

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.400
shoes.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.340
What he did was put photos of the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.400
shoes that were in other stores, and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.300
when he had an order, because he went

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.660
to the store, he bought it and delivered

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.680
it to the customer.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.120
This allowed him to validate the hypothesis.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.680
It also allowed, another that is

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.080
the second of the benefits, is to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.160
have immediate contact with customers.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.960
And at first what you have is

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.880
contact with early adopters,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.120
which are those customers who

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.740
are really waiting for a proposal

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.280
like yours and who help you

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.140
build the product.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.880
It is important.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.140
You don’t know everything you

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.740
learn when you have, from

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.900
the moment you have contact with

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.000
customers.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.220
You may have been months in

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.320
the office planning and thinking

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.820
things, but it’s the reality with

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.680
customers when you start learning

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.880
what they want, how they use

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.220
your product, helps you evolve

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220
it, etc.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.520
Groupon left the market with a very

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.880
clear strategy of minimum viable

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.680
product.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.080
What he did was a very simple

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.560
WordPress blog, and when you

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.640
bought by email with a pdf and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280
spent hours a day doing it.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.740
Something super inefficient.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.100
What happens is that it allowed him

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.220
to get out very quickly, it allowed

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.400
him to start having, since that,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.340
to validate the hypotheses and to

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.800
have contact with customers from the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.520
first day.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.500
Another of the clearest benefits

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.780
of the minimum viable product is

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.280
that we will not waste time and

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.060
money building a product that

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.780
you think is perfect, but that

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.080
in the bottom, customers

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.560
do not value it.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.500
The IMV is a success

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.220
story by Eric Rice,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.900
the author of Lean Startup.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.740


00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.080
And he tells us that he has a

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.840
company that has some avatars, I

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.680
don’t know exactly how it works,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.380
and he, well, when they

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.520
were initially developing the

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.820
product, had no idea that the avatars

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.180
would move as we put the example

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.700
of the sims, that is, that they

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.100
could move along the screen,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.320
that they could, that they could

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.460
walk through the screen.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.880
But of course, that took them, that

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.860
development would cost them

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.380
a lot of time and a lot of money.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.420
So what they did is a minimum

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.540
viable development and is that

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.160
the client could, the user could

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.900
click, click on the screen

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.460
site where he wanted his avatar

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.280
to move and the avatar

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.040
directly teleported.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.680
I didn’t have to be walking.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.200
Imagine what this savings is.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.500
Well, Eric Rice tells us that he

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.980
really gave him a lot, that gave

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.440
him shame and feared to go out to

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.120
do such a development, which seemed

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.900
to him very cuddly.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.040
It turned out that customers

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.640
loved it.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.320
That surprised them very much because

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.420
they expected to be told that it was

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.900
very cuddly, that they wanted the more

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.920
expensive development, etc.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.680
Well, it turns out that the

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.400
customers loved it.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.300
Thus, a lot of time

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.660
and money were saved.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.460
And this happens many times.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.220
You give of course something, you give

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.320
of course that you have to create a

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.500
product that is, for I don’t know,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.900
wonderful, but what is wonderful

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.560
for you and it turns out that reality

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.340
is another.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.460
And it turns out that with a minimum

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.540
of a viable product, it is more than

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.700
viable and customers even prefer it.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.840
Look at the savings that this means.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.080
Another benefit is that going

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.660
to the market in a week instead

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.180
of a year allows you to learn

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.940
much faster than others.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.240
And we are increasingly in a more

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.580
competitive environment where the

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.880
faster you go, the much better.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.180
So, that learning process,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.280
if you do it much faster than

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.860
others, I guarantee you will

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.060
end up having a competitive

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.800
advantage.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.080
Well, and finally, the minimum

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.840
viable product will allow

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.320
you to build the perfect product.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.760
But the perfect product is not the

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.840
product you have in your head

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.720
the first day.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.680
Because that product is very likely that

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.580
customers will not have the

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.520
same opinion as you.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.380
The perfect product will

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.020
help us build customers.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.120
We will come out with the

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.920
minimum viable product and

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.040
from the feedback we will have

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.100
from customers, we will

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.080
build a project that will bring

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.120
more value.
