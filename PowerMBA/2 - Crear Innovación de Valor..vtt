00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.740
Let us start by remembering the goal.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.500
The goal is to create value innovation.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.440
It is this concept that introduces

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.760
the Blue Ocean Strategy book, which

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.960
is to offer more value to customers

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.060
at a lower cost for the company.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.540


00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.480
A lower cost for the company

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.640
does not have to be a lower price.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.380
What we will do is reduce the cost

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.180
structure and if we want to we

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.700
can impact that, that cost drop

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.900
and offer a lower price than

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.960
competitors, but it doesn’

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.480
t have to be so.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.260
We can offer the same price and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720
increase the margins, or

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.780
we could even raise prices

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.260
and if we offer much more

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.000
value, we could raise prices.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680
Really the innovation in value is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.280
that it sounds so very simple, it

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.880
is very difficult to and, in addition,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.160
if we realize, it is contradictory

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.820
with all the strategy

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.760
and with all the knowledge,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
even with the business

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.960
logic so far.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.200
Remember what we studied

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.340
at The Power MBA in the course

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.880
of competitive strategies, we

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.920
saw Michael Porter’

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000
s generic strategies.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.940
What does Porter say?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.800
It tells us that we have to choose

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.160
between seeking differentiation, that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.480
is, investing more to offer more

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.300
value and raise prices, or being

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.620
a cost leader.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.320
Choosing is the key word.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.800
However, the Blue Ocean strategy

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.220
tells us that we can look for both

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.820
and approaches at the same time.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.620
We can offer more value to customers

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.600
by reducing the cost for the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.180
company.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.100
Another way to see it is from the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.800
value curve.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.120
Let’s think that this is the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.260
value curve of your sector.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.420
If you choose a differentiation strategy,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.980
what you usually do is invest

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.260
in all the competitive

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.820
factors you invest the most.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.160
You think you have a restaurant.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.380
If you have a restaurant and you want

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.580
to offer more value, because

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.700
imagine, you want to increase the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.040
value you are offering because a

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.700
new one has emerged What are you doing?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.200
Because you redecorate the local,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.740
contract more service, hire a better

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.020
cook, etc., and offer more value,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.540
but it always comes with more

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.080
cost, as we are seeing in the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.580
curve.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.040
Or, on the contrary, a company

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.980
that decides to opt for

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.140
a low cost strategy, of lowering

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.440
prices, what it does is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.400
reduce costs, but also offers

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.660
a lower value to its customers.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.020
And the Blue Ocean strategy tells

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.260
us that we have to overcome this

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and that we have to think,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.240
or at least try, to offer value

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.020
innovation.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.200
The curve of value could be done

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.420
like this.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.620
In some factors we are offering

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.840
much more value and in other

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.820
factors what we have done is to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.580
reduce the cost a lot.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.620
And how will we do it?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.800
Well, we’ll do it through

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.280
a tool called the RISE matrix,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.100
or RAIS matrix, if we

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.980
say it in English.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.020
And this matrix, this model, is very

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.360
simple, but helps to think.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.800
It will help you think.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.940
You always have to start from

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.440
the value curve and we will use

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.360
the RISE matrix to go making

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.960
our modifications.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.200
And how does it work?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.480
RISE is the acronym for

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.180
reducing, increasing,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.700
eliminating and creating.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.540
On the one hand, the goal

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.980
was to reduce costs, costs

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.000
for the company.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.760
And how do we do it?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.760
We do this through the blocks

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.280
that are in green, which are to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.300
reduce, eliminate.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.940
What we will do is to competitive

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.380
or variable factors of those

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.100
that are, of the usual in

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.760
our industry.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.020
We will be very brave and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.720
some will reduce them very much.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.740
We will de-invest a lot in some

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.940
of the factors and some of them

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.820
we will even eliminate.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.800
This is often scary because when

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.300
everyone in your industry offers

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.880
something and you suddenly

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.820
decide that you will either offer

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.240
a lot less of that value, you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.620
will disinvest a lot or you

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.620
will directly eliminate it.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.620
Well, it seems to be very

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.100
scary.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.340
But what is the consequence?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.600
The result of what you will is

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.640
that you will reduce the costs

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.760
for the company enormously.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.580
Let me give you an example,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.860
Mercadona.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.820
Mercadona decided to reduce the number

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.380
of brands it offered.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.140
All supermarkets competed in having

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.800
a wide variety of brands and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.440
Mercadona decided to reduce it.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.140
It was a brave decision and we

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.500
could put it on the quadrante to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.280
reduce and that helped to lower

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.460
costs.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.200
We have already reduced

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.600
costs.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.080
How can we increase

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.060
the value?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.420
We will this by increasing

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.700
the value offered in some

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.920
of the factors and what is

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.480
the most difficult of all, identifying,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.120
this is not always possible,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.040
but by identifying some

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.300
additional factors, values

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.900
that your industry,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.300
your competition has never

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.800
raised.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.680
Therefore, by increasing and creating

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.760
what we is to increase

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.400
much the perceived value, the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.360
value offered to customers.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.800
In the end we would have a curve like

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.380
the one we have seen before, in

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.420
which we have a series of factors

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.780
in which we offer much more value

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.900
and others much more value and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.000
also we have invested more in

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.880
those factors and others in which

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.480
we have deinvested a lot and

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.500
offer a lower value, but we transfer

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.900
it to a lower cost for the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.760
company.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.640
As you can see, the recent matrix

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.240
helps us from the industry’s

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.440
value curve, helps us to think about

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.700
what factors we have to reduce,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.920
which factors we could eliminate,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.740
what factors we could increase

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.880
value a lot and if we are able

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.280
to create some additional value

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.740
that no one has thought,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.560
because what competitive

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.700
factors we can create,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.520
we can add to the value proposal.
