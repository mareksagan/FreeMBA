WEBVTT

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.640
We have talked about that Agile is like

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.800
a toolbox, a philosophy, it is a

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.740
mindset and inside there are many and

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.780
there are some that for example Lean

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.340
Startup already know our students

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.060
and there is another that is very

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.340
well known that is Scrum.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.440
Then I would like you to explain

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.380
a little about what Scrum helps,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.980
that in the end what helps

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.560
you is...

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.900
It helps you with the methodology

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.920
to do things following the Agile

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.820
philosophy, right?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.520
Let us take the example

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.720
of creating a website.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.960


00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.460
and correct.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.560
See, at the end of Scrum is all

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.640
we have been talking to now about

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.580
Agile project management but

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.520
already materialized specifically

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.020
and what does the Scrum framework,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.120
which is also to say that is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.620
the most used worldwide,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.400
will help you to concretize

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.040
that, right?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.860
That is, all those ideas we have talked

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.200
about earlier, how do I embrace them

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.020
in something that helps me the day

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.260
to concretize it?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.140
In this regard, we will talk about two

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.900
things in particular.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.260
The first, some roles, defines certain

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.800
roles, that is, people who

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.160
will work in a Scrum environment

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.560
will have responsibilities

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
and we will talk in addition to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960
what are the events that will

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.220
allow me to make a continuous

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.580
flow within Scrum.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.680
Scrum, let's say, helps us first

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.900
when we create the team, how to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320
form it, right?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.940
How we make it, what roles should

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.020
there be inside.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.520
and yes.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.320
And then, through what events

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.700
or activities we're going to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.420
constantly perform to ensure

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.720
we're doing incremental iterative

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.840
deliveries.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.100
So, it's a matter of time,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.660
right?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.940
and yes.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.000
What to do, stages

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.040
or stages.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.720
and correct.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.980
well is.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.240
So I think it's best to start talking

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.860
about the framework as such

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.300
first.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.860
The framework as such respects what

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.880
we talked about before, is an iterative

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.380
cycle through and is not blurred

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.560
a product of half or this part

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.400
of the system, no.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.840
It is a potentially deliverable

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.220
product, ready to use to a customer.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.500
That is between two and four weeks.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.160
In addition, you will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.960
be able to define three key roles.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.240
That is, imagine, we started a project,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.300
we want to do it with Scrum,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.120
how do we conform that team?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.680
We think of three roles.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.660
First is the owner, the owner of the product.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.800
This profile will be responsible

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.300
for defining what to do in the product

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.500
and in the order.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700
It is he who will tell you, guys,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.420
the team, you have to do this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.840
series of functionalities in this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.380
order of importance.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.800
Well, that's the key figure, because it'

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.040
s the one that's going to tell you what

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.200
the business is and in what direction to go.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320
Then there is the development team

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.560
or the Scrum team, the development

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.140
team, which will be intentionally

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.160
called so and have not put roles

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.380
or profiles apart, because they

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.960
see it as a multidisciplinary

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.100
team, this implies that you will

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.440
have within that team people of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.120
all skills, people of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.460
marketing, people of system,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.540
people of commercial, etc.,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.800
people of risk and will be

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.380
a multidisciplinary team

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.700
with all the roles that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.160
are needed to complete

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.000
the product.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.040
If I am making an application that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100
has legal consequences, then I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.260
am putting a lawyer.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.520
If I'm doing an application that has

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.360
a consequence of the risk point

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.140
of view, then I'm putting someone

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.320
legal and so I'm going.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.760
And besides, we've already said, the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.220
Product Owner and the development

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.780
team, there's the Scrum Master.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.580
The Scrum Master will be

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.800
that figure who will be responsible

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.220
for making the framework

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.980
work.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.680
What does this mean?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.560
That will be in charge of meeting,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.700
that the profiles are, that they

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.620
are delivered by cycles, that those

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.340
cycles are validated by the client,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.980
will be like the guardian.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.040
They are highly valued professionals.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.060
To make an idea, today they are

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.980
professionals who are above 60

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580
each year, because apart from this

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.960
work it requires a deep knowledge

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.120
of the framework, because

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.600
they also facilitate.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.660
They are those who tell you how

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.320
much there will be meeting, make the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.920
whole market, democratize, etc.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.300
They are responsible for making everything

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.080
flow.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.800
I have recaptured three roles.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.500
The product owner who says what the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.000
management, the work team who

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640
runs the how and the Scrum Master

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.880
who will make sure that all this

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.440
happens within a Scrum framework.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.740
Once we have that team and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.900
we have the three roles,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300
the first thing to do is

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.520
to divide the project into

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.760
cycles and say after I want

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.000
to do it 15 days, I want

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.620
to do it 15 days or four weeks.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.020
Always the recommendation is that

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.540
the less you cut the cycle, the better,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.900
because you have more dating ability.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.200


00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.360
Once I have that defined, what I

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.460
will do is make the list of requirements

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.180
that I will have prioritized.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.460
How does it work?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.520
This is the second part of the events.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.060
There is an event that will happen

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.680
at the beginning of a cycle called

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.400
Spring Planning, where the product

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.220
owner and the development team

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.660
will sit down and negotiate

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.680
what they will do in the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.760
next 15 days.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120
Then the product owner will tell

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.420
you we're going to do these

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.580
three features and people commit

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.500
to delivering them.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.800
This I want before we go on, we can

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.960
really shock the names, in the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.480
bottom are things like it has

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040
been called Kikoff, at the end

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.700
Scrum, as it is a mythology what

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.920
you do put their names, but it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.600
is an initial meeting in which we

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.220
all sit down and define what is

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.020
what we are going to do.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.080
This is the first of the events.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.960
And that happens every cycle, everything

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.080
I'll tell happens always every

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.720
cycle.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.240
The first session is called

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.640
Spring Planning, according

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.920
to Scrum.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.480
It's a meeting where the product

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.820
owner and the development team come

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.500
together and agree what they're

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.200
going to deliver in the next 15 days.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.960
Look at that there is an important

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.320
part that the fact that they remember

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.200
breaks a little that traditional

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.500
boss mentality by telling me

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.960
what to do but negotiate, with

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.080
which it is giving a more entrepreneurial

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.840
character to people.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.420
Once I'm clear I'm going to

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.640
do the next 15 days, start

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.920
stealing the Spring and past

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.320
15 days is the second most important

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.420
meeting called the Spring

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.440
Review or the demo, the demo

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.480
day, the day when the team

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.020
will tell the Product Owner

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.900
what it has done.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.940
In addition, the Product Owner

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.080
can often invite other stakeholders,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.120
people who are involved

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.780
such.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.660
What is done?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.000
The product is counted, what has

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.040
been achieved and then feedback is issued.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.180
I didn't like it, returning the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.340
example of the website, I didn't like

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.100
to talk home, I don't accept American

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.780
Express cards and all that feedback

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.520
that is incorporated

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.240
comes back into the cycle.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.220
That way you're constantly

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.960
planning, delivering and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.480
re-planning in every Spring.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.660
And there is a final meeting that starts

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.080
from the great features of Scrum that

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.140
have to do with continuous improvement,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.760
concept lean, concept agile that

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.200
are the retrospective meetings

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.020
and is that apart from planning,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.860
delivering a demo at the end of that

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.560
Spring and before starting the

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.580
next, the team meets all together

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.940
and say guys that we have done

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.320
well, because we have done well

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.840
this and this and this, because

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.140
we will continue doing it.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.120
What did we not do these other

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.800
things too?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.080
We have a plan of action to prevent

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.240
this from happening.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.560
This is where you are focusing

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.300
on the customer, risk management

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.840
and continuous improvement.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.720
Then let's say that Scrum does what

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.020
is materializing or making explicit

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.740
the whole philosophy already

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.740
through events and concrete roles.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.280
And it is the most used

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.420
framework that has excellent

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.860
results worldwide.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.660
I love the truth because, as you

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.480
said, it obliges us, that sometimes

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.580
we have to force ourselves with

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.740
methods to apply philosophies that

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.260
really work, but that if there

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.380
is no method, I like the methods

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.660
very much for this.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.160
If there is no method, we do not.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.160
Just, that is, one thing is to understand

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.420
a methodology, a philosophy,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.060
and then you have the inability

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.220
to put it into practice.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.120
I believe Scrum from the first minute

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.540
helps you by discipline to put it into

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.600
practice and not do it yours, because

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.520
in the end you do it yours and

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.160
it already enters your DNA.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.400
That is, although it sounds a bit

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.340
friki, the names and such, no, no, apply

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.040
it because it obliges you to make good

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.020
decisions because it is thought,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.380
it is born of a philosophy

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.500
that is appropriate.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.140
and exact.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.640
And what you do is make yourself

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.700
explicit that you follow that philosophy.
