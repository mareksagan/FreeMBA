00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.560
This of what we're going to talk about

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.600
the truth is that I love it because it's

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.880
a reality that a lot of people

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.220
when making estimates of the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.280
size of the market come to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.900
conclusions that is that they're stupid.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.400
It makes a little the story of

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.560
the milkhouse, because you start from

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.100
above, you start to make estimates.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.460
I'll explain it to you with what's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040
called the 1% falsehood.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.480
You think you're going to enter

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.160
the Chinese market, but it doesn't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.400
matter, but the Chinese

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.020
market is very big, billions.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.620
You say, well, I'm going to enter

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.180
the Chinese market, billions.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.860
What amount am I going to?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.060
You start making estimates

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.420
downwards.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.620
How much will I stay?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.720
At least 1 percent, right?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.460
It has to be very bad to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.760
not get the 1%.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840
You say, the 1% I will charge

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.620
a lot of pasta.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.760
It seems to you a lot.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.280
You say, well, I will be careful.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.960
Instead of 1% we are

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.980
still at 0.1.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.600
We should not be able

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.720
to get the 0.1.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.420
You're going to get it in Excel,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.000
right?

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.260
And you also get a lot of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.720
millions.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.140
And then it turns out that you

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.420
get to the Chinese market and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
it is not that you don't buy the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.300
0.1, it is that you buy 0 Chinese,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.380
because you don't have a proposal

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.600
to get there, etc., etc.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.720
And all you had done was the tale

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.420
of the milk-tree.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.940
And that happens a lot of times.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.680
Especially when you have proposals

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.560
that are innovative, you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.720
don't know what's going to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.600
happen.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.140
Because if you enter the Chinese market,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560
in a mature market and you are already

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.840
selling something, etc., then there

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
is less risk, right?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.460
But when it's innovative, you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.860
don't buy one, right?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.480
Buying 0

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.480
So, it's okay to understand how

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.660
you can make the estimate from

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.500
top to bottom, which is the Samsung

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.280
Thumb, which is top parts and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.420
you say, well, I can get to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.640
this market, I'm going to stay

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.540
with so much, etc.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.980
But we always recommend using a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.800
different analysis that is less

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.160
orthodox,, that is downward-upward,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.620
that is starting from what is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.480
happening from the observation,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.160
even if it is less scientific,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.860
well, and upward.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.880
And look, I will explain it with

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.240
an example.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.800
We think you have a tax

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.300
advice and you create

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.980
a start-up advice service.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.480
How would it be from above to below?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.440
You use Samsung thumb and you say,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.180
because the thumb is all companies

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.020
in Spain.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.540
The thumb, as what we do is, let's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.560
see what the startups are

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.280
and let's think what they are

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.560
that we could get to, right?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.540
Then, from here, you do what you

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.360
do is apply a hypothesis of what

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.760
share you will reach within that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.340
market, which would be your SOM.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.180
We will capture 10% of the market every

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.560
year.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.080
So you say, well, my SOM, the Obtainable,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.000
what I'm going to get

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960
are 100 customers a year.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
I don't want you to stay so much

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.340
with the concrete numbers, but

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.260
how did we do it?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.380
100 customers per year.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.640
That's what you put in the business

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.980
plan, that's what you expect and that's what

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.800
makes it different.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.040
Instead of starting from market

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620
studies, the number there

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.660
is, etc., etc., we forget all

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.900
that and what we're going to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720
do is, let's look at what's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.280
happening.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.520
Let us see what the reality

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.480
of life is every day.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.400
And I pay you an example, because you take

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.120
it and offer it, you when you launch

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.260
that advice, you take it and offer

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.800
it to 10 startups.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.980
You give it to 10, you sit with

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.400
10 and from 10 you buy one.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.020
So, you already know you have

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.260
a quick out of every potential

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080
customer of 10%.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
This is not market studies or

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.780
mental downs, this is what

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.680
is happening.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.540
You sit with 10 and catch one.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.320
Well, then you say, look, but

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.380
how much can I grow?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.400
Another variable we have to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.520
consider is, how many people,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.240
with how many people can

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.600
we meet each month?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.280
Because that is a limitation.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.560
Well, it turns out that you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.920
eventually doing some campaign,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.740
etc., etc., you can meet

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.020
with 20 per month.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.600
If you meet with 20 companies a month

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.280
and have a conversion rate of 10%,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880
how many customers will you capture

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.400
a month?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.480
by 2.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.180
This is the reality.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.560
How many customers are you going to capture per year?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.540
12 months for two, 24 customers.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.980
We have come, as you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.600
see, by doing it from below

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.840
to above, to a different

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.040
conclusion.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.640
We were talking before when we applied

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.180
the Samsung Time, etc., that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.440
we were going to capture 100 customers,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.320
that was the 10% of the share

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.760
of we are seeing what is happening

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.820
and we do it downward,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.800
because it turns out that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.600
we get 24.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.160
And they can be 20 or 30, but they

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.660
won't be 100, unless you change your

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.720
structure, do things differently

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.400
and more.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.640
So, the Samsung Time, from those

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.500
market shares you were thinking

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.300
you could capture, etc.,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.760
because they were not correct.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.820
So as a recommendation, always

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.980
what we recommend is that, in addition

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.020
to doing the Samsung Time,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.460
etc., you use a different criterion

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.080
that is the bottom-up, that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.180
you look around what is what

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.400
is happening, that you start

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.360
selling, etc., and then from

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.700
there extrapolate, because

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.820
in many cases what will happen

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.900
is that you will come to

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.840
different conclusions.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.300
And if I had to choose, I would

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.500
get with the bottom-up approach,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.600
because it's much more tied to

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.460
real life and there's not so much

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.700
market study, statistics

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.780
and so on.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.140
No, no, that is what we are seeing.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.400
This we talk about from top to bottom

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.520
and from bottom to top, etc., is especially

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.800
important when for entrepreneurs

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.280
or for large or small companies,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.760
it doesn't matter, they are launching

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.580
something that has uncertainty

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.520
or innovative risk, that

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.760
we don't know how to fit

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.060
in the market, right?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.800
When that is the case, you don't

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.600
have to do any market studies,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.040
statistics, or get excel, or anything

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.660
of that.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.260
What is worth it is observation.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.460
Then I here, anecdotally,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.500
tell you that when entrepreneurs

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.780
come and they start to talk about

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.000
the market and so on, I say, look,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.460
uncle, do something, because

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.620
so you will come out of doubt.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.820
Offer it to 10, 20, 30, 40, I don't

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.280
know, depending on a little, common

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.200
sense, people without much effort that

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.420
are people of your target audience

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.120
and make sure or find out how

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.680
many of them want to buy you.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.720
I tell you that if you are able,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.580
with little effort, to tell people

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.260
around you and there are people

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.460
who are willing to pay for it,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.080
people, of course, don't be a rarity

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.920
in the world.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.200
Usually you find people you can extrapolate,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.880
because there are probably

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.540
thousands or millions of

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.440
people like them.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.060
Then I would be willing to

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.360
invest in it, I'm sure you'll go

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.580
phenomenal and I don't need any

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.900
kind of market research or

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.020
anything like that.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.880
Because you are demonstrating that

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.480
with little effort you are able to

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.180
sell a lot of people.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.540
You find people and this you can extrapolate,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.960
because like them there are millions

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.300
and you have cost little effort

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.060
to find them, do you understand?

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.900
So different approach.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.600
Stop thinking, market research,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.820
and talk about it.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.740
Look at how this works.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.040
Sometimes no one wants to buy you.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.660
So it doesn't matter that the market

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.940
is huge, because they don't

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.660
want to buy you.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.480
It costs you a lot to sell.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.420
You will be going to go on a

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.480
shit because it costs you a lot

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.980
to sell.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.860
You will escalate that.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.520
It is multiplying zero by one million, because

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.800
it is still coming out zero.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.180
Instead, if instead of multiplying

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.740
zero, what you are multiplying

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.900
is that with little effort

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.220
you are selling people.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.100
There are many such people, because

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.860
they have a huge market.
