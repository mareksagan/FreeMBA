WEBVTT

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.240
After all this, we decided

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.420
we would do it ourselves.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.640
Then, we basically bought 25 hectares

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.100
in Valencia around the school and we

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.220
were going to make a rather pioneering

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.940
neighborhood, called La Pinada, La

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.160
Pinada neighborhood, very different

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.640
in content and in the process

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.900
of gestation.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.640
So, basically we are co-creating

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.820
with future inhabitants, it'

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.200
s a bit to turn it around and say,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.500
we're going to apply Lean Startup to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.360
a promotion sector, which is like

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.600
super archaic, and basically

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.760
we're going to talk to you, customer,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.920
to understand, understand you,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.300
understand how you want to live,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.680
what your budget is, and we'

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.020
re going to define the product,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.300
understood as neighborhood, as

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.040
housing, that makes sense to

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.720
you.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.460
This can result in many

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.620
room formulas.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.020
And it's like giving a turn totally

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.680
to the sector, where we equally

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.340
spend a 10% of the equity of what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220
a promoter or a normal realizer would

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.760
do, because we don't sell on a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060
plane with the streets pulled.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.220
We sell a dream, a concept, people

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.120
start pointing and a point comes,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.300
we start to urbanize and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.960
build, because it comes

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.700
a moment almost to execute

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.820
everything at once.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.180
In what stage are you?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.840
And then, the surprising thing

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.040
about this is that when we, as a

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.260
little team that we were pushing

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.440
this, we seemed quite interesting,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.020
and that we would live there,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
but we didn't even know how

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.480
many more people would live.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.680
A little market acceptance,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.440
market risk.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.860
The surprising thing is that in a couple

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.680
of months they have targeted 1,000

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.700
people to live there.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.440
There are 1,200 houses.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.480
Then, in the end, they will live with

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.880
about 4,000 people and we have

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.320
1,000 families that have shown interest.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.120
And very aligned with the theme of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.680
sustainability or that they have a

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.780
spectacular environment for their children

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.720
to grow and live.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.680
And then, what we will realize is that,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.540
if we see a little bit on the plane

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.700
of people and not so much the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.960
product, more than selling housing,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.320
what we would like is to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.960
sell live.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.300
And that leads us to a very different

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.900
plan of thinking about what you want

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.360
to in your life and what you need.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.800
How can we make it easier for you?

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.460
Regardless of your budget.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.240
Almost a model, almost a word

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.180
that has never been, but we use

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.980
it, which is living as a service.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.420


00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.180
Listen, look, beyond living being

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.800
a space, how you move, what

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.100
you need, etc.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.700
It will be very

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.940
different from any neighborhood

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.960
we know.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.200
As an example, this sounds very

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.620
good to this movie, let's land it.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.220
For example, imagine the access

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.160
model offers property.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.140
For example, if you are thinking about

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.660
circular economy and ways that will

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.900
simplify you a little, or allow

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.380
you to get more out of your money.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.340
The traditional model when you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100
have children is, I buy a cradle.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.140
Buy me?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.880
and a cave.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680
I buy a cradle, use it for 12 months,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.740
18 months, and then I put it in the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.940
shelter or give it to someone or

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.460
revend it.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.180
I spend 200 euros on this.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.940
Our proposal will be, does it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.240
really make sense to buy a crib?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.200
Why not rent it to you?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.520
So why not rent it?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.980
Instead of $200, you will

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.520
be charged $50.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.120
As a starting point, I save you 150

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.060
euros, which you can use for other

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.720
things.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.940
Then, to me as a neighborhood,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.100
it implies me some income, because

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.480
I with this cradle can give it many rotates.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.240
And then, in front of me, I

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.680
got a bar and shot it on the street

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.640
because I don't know how to repair

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.540
this, if something is broken,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.980
we will repair it, clean

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.200
it, etc., and give it to the next.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.700
This promotes local employment

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.200
and reduces waste.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.120
Everyone ultimately wins

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.020
on such a model.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.240
And there can be a lot of things about this.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.120
Another example.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.840
Have you created a catalog

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.460
of services?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.360
We are in that.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.740
Talk to the families, too.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.280
Initially we thought that families

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.000
have approached a very diverse

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.460
audience, from grandparents to singles,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.160
from a site so far away with

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.420
their philosophy.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.740
Or you get your child sick and now

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.940
what do I do, right?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.160
You can't even shoot, and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.220
why not a hand-held

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.920
canguro?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.820
That takes away a lot of

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.400
stress, right?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.480
It's like, we'll make you live quieter,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.580
better, and that way you return

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.120
hours so you can be more comfortable.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.020
I think that at the end of

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.320
the interesting, more than this will

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.340
take a long time, I think it will be

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.260
an interesting site to read

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.280
metrics like what is the birth rate

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.260
in this neighborhood?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.540
What is the life expectancy?

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.920
That I think it will be very different,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.720
because what it is demonstrating is,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.580
for example, social interaction,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.660
social cohesion ends up creating well-

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.800
being and ends up creating

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.540
health, right?

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.400
As an example, there are neighborhoods

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.140
in Valencia that I've seen, or sites

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.760
in Valencia where, for example, there'

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.240
s a school and at the school exit

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.880
there's a park nearby, right?

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.700
And if that nearby park is even attached

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
to school, many children stay

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.600
playing, even if there is no

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.060
street.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.880
And if, in addition to that park,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.820
you would see parents with cross-

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.820
arms waiting for their children

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820
to play and chat, if you had

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.960
a cafeteria in that pedestrian area

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.160
where parents can take a coffee,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.820
a cup or whatever they want,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.140
that is, those four sites that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.760
there are in Valencia are always

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.900
flooding.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.840
Why is it?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.360
Because something as simple as,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.920
well, you have it as a child, but

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.220
why do I have to sacrifice it

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.300
to have it as well?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.440
And in a way that I don't feel safe,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.360
there are no cars passing, I've been

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.500
watching you more or less,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.420
etc., etc., right?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.260
Then through the form, you

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.380
have a bestial influence on

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.900
the result.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.320
Then, a diode and picture, when

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.400
one thinks of the product, think about,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.880
almost it doesn't matter the orientation

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.800
of the houses, almost it doesn'

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920
t matter where you take the

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.020
streets.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.780
So you're thinking about how

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.720
many meters of roof I have, how

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.560
much I'm going to sell, how much

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.260
is the square meter.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.460
We think about how to be happy

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.220
and live better.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.300
And how can we use the form,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.640
technology, etc., to allow

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.280
you that.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.400
Because through technology

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.780
I can favor, for example,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.700
social interactions, etc.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.880
And then there will be a very

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.300
different abaric, will you?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.320
Where people with very

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.980
different budgets can go very well

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.300
and almost build on what you have

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.340
in common and not on what differentiates

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.140
you.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.960
Because in general the very, say, very

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.320
brilliant neighborhoods for families

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.200
with a certain purchasing

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.320
power have become very closed

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.620
and very exclusive.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.180
What is seen is exclusivity.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.340
And they are neighborhoods where there

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.040
is very little diversity, where you

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.840
have to play the car, thank

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.160
you, to go to sites and so on.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.500
Why do you have to sacrifice him?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.960
I am an urban, I like to drink

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.360
a drink from time to time, I like

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.360
to drink a coffee, I like to

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.620
work, I work more and more in

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.680
cafes, right?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.080
I like that environment, right?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.220
Why do I have to sacrifice that and

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.760
go to a place in the Fifth Pine

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.500
where, well, my children can run

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.520
to shoot with their friends and

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.460
I have to pick up the car to the

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.660
room to buy the newspaper and have

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.360
a coffee?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.800
Why can't you get all that,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.180
right?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.580
Why not change that paradigm?

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.940
And the paradigm that in certain locations

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.760
there is a certain price, right?

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.980
This is not cheap, this is the whole scale.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.980
And why can't we have that here people

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.840
of different profiles, that you can

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.840
have the, don't you? 30% WMP and

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.400
the most beautiful expensive

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.340
in Valencia too.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.020
Why not?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.200
And that you even have an offer

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.260
that allows people to

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.380
self-select, right?

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.100
In the end, that's a little bit

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.640
what...

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.820
So for our co-creation process what

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.000
we define is a bit of the clusters

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.700
or type of people you can group on

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.400
that they share things, at the end

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.760
you have a bit of a neighborhood

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.000
level governance model and subcommunities

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.380
that have things in common with

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.920
the whole neighborhood but things

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.000
equally differences from

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.480
other communities and nothing

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.840
happens, that's okay, right?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.300
You can finish a lot of things,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.800
right?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.220
A lot of comparisons, many formulas,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.960
right?

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.300
And everyone ultimately enjoys

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.320
a very vibrant atmosphere and a

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.860
whole host of service packs, right?

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.700
A thousand stories,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.140
right?

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.300
Even of utility, right?

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.620
Because you can't put together,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.000
listen, look, we directly

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.020
put energy, water and telco

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.340
in a pack.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.560
In other words, it will cost you much less.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.120
Because apart from how we will design

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.120
houses so that they are very

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.260
energy efficient, orientations,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.800
cross ventilation, bioclimate

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.380
houses, etc., it is that at

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.140
the end our energy consumption

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.080
will be minimal,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.680
right?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.320
A couple of weeks ago we announced

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.420
that Europe has chosen us as a

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.560
pioneering neighborhood in the

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.720
fight against climate change because

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.140
we will always break the paradigm

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.580
of this, right?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.460
So, if we are now in the world

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.460
of new housing, new promotions,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.480
etc. because in the end that

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.740
is pushed beyond the birth rate

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.600
that falls in the end they are

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.520
still creating new homes.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.740
So on the one hand is the whole

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.320
battle of the regeneration

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.440
of housing, no? of old

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.380
housing, but also the new housing.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.100
And why can't we do something

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.580
that inspires change and is

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.900
a reference to rethinking how

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.940
cities grow, right?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.560
And that almost for us success

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.980
would be that when you came to the

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.200
pine, would you say, wow, what

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.920
past is this.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.360
And when you fly to Madrid and say, hear,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.740
I don't have a son or so, or where

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.340
I want to go to live, say, oysters, I

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.640
wish I had something like the pineapple,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.120
right?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.980
And whether we did it, or others,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.320
that something very, very different

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.800
was done, didn't it?

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.000
And in the end that it would create

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.780
a social, environmental, bestial impact,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.620
no? that's a bit of our goal.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.980
Then, in the end, just like we measure

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.580
profitability, we measure a little

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.020
the creation of social and environmental

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.580
value, in this sense.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.080
And well, and here we are now a

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.360
bit in a phase where we are involving

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.580
corporates and future inhabitants

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.400
developing joint solutions, right?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.520
because it's also a sector where

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.160
a little supply chain is a conflicting

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.480
chain, that is, almost one

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.520
doesn't talk to the promoter,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.380
struggles with the architect,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.580
struggles with the constructor,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.020
this is a bit absurd,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.680
right?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.500
Then each one is defining their margins

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.260
and I think that change the dynamics,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.480
that is, no, look, we will sit

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.920
down, we will agree that they are

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.760
reasonable margins and from there

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.880
we will see how we create the

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.160
best solution that we bring

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.120
value to the customer, because

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.280
then we all win.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.980
And this is almost more like concurrent

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.380
engineering, right? that's getting

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.440
people very early and creating extraordinary

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.880
solutions, right?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.540
There are no interesting cases that

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.520
are a crossroads of, for example, WeWork,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.520
right?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.480
It's an interesting case that

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.180
we've studied, but in the end it's like

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.200
you're thinking a little about the role

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.540
of offices, in more modern times,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.300
isn't it?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.320
And I think we can create something

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.260
very interesting, right?

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.380
Almost like WeWork for new neighborhoods,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.120
new ways of life, right?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.440
It's not just how you work, but how

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.280
you live.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.960
Even in our own neighborhood

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.100
we will have co-working spaces,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.960
work, right?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.000
So almost that's the simplest

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.420
thing that's good, that 80% of

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.660
the things I need are there.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.360
And yes, that's very permeable and I can catch

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
it, right?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.880
And go to other places, etc., but

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.420
that you can almost live there,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.900
that you have a work space,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.740
that you do not work every day,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.140
but at least if I go, to say something,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.720
to meetings, because I

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.840
have a couple of days that I

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.780
can work from there, and it

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.080
simplifies my life, right?

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.460
And you have, apart from our

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.320
school, let's say, that it's private,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.040
there will be three public schools

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.160
and that's part of the spirit

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.520
of doing it as very integrated,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.240
right?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.320
You can have fun, you

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.440
and your kids too.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.460
And little change that paradigm of if

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.500
you are going through it well as a

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.220
son, is that I am there with

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.140
crossed arms, right?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.040
I think there is a lot of potential,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.680
right?

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.060
In the end, we will live better.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.460
I've really talked a lot about

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.560
technology, right?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.980
But because in the end I see the human

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.980
component that you almost want to determine

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.180
where you want to go.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.400
Technology is a means to get

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.900
there.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.860
And obviously, coming from technology,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.020
we will use it and a lot, but

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.680
without losing focus.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.920
That is a bit of the idea.
