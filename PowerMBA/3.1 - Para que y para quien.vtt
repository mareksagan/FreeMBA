WEBVTT

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.160
We have already seen what are the

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.660
benefits of Power Launch Formula.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.700
What happens is that within Power

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.800
MBA there are people in situations

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.400
and with very different goals and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.780
we will analyze them and we will

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.620
see how Power Launch Formula helps

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.460
each of them.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.820
We will rely on the four customer

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.500
person we use internally,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.880
this is a theme of our,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.740
in the Power MBA.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.740
We have identified these customer person

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.120
and what we have done has been

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.300
adapting the campaigns, adapting

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.820
the proposal and more.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.240
So what I encourage you is to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.860
identify which of them you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.520
are.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.980
They are four, they are dreamer, they are

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.340
entrepreneur, they are entrepreneur and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.500
they are managers.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.180
Let's start with the dreamer.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.300
Dreamer is a person who has a dream

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.120
and wants to change their life.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.520
Usually what they want is to undertake,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.500
what they want is to have more freedom,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.260
what they want to be their own

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.220
bosses, regardless

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
of the situation they are in,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.820
although almost everyone

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.800
has work.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.740
Some have a family business

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.860
or whatever, but everyone

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.280
has a dream.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.300
Within this customer person we can

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.360
identify two, some already have

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.500
ideas or have an idea in the head

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.780
that they want to put in place but

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.700
have not started and others

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.840
do not have the idea.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.960
But it doesn't matter because what

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.620
unites them is that they haven't

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.340
gotten in the way.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.880
And we will analyze what the pains

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.760
are, what is what hurts them or in

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.060
this case what is what stops them.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.620
Why have they not started?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.220
And almost everyone is afraid to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.700
fail, they are afraid to lose their money,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.540
they are afraid to leave their job,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.920
they are afraid that that idea they

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
have doesn't make sense and in addition

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.640
or in some cases they don't even know

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.540
how to start.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.440
Then Powerlands Formula will

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.840
help them turn those

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.260
dreams into dreamer,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.600
to pursue their dreams and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.860
to make them successful.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.540
And how?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.840
There are many ways, but I will highlight

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.480
three.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.960
One is that it helps them identify ideas

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
and validate those ideas from the perspective

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.240
of whether those ideas are

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.000
for them.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.380
There must be a match there.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.920
This is also very important, it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.120
is a huge benefit, it helps

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.140
dreamers to take the first

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.980
steps with very little risk.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900
This is completely different, you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.380
don't have to take any real risk.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.880
You will have to invest time, obviously,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.340
some effort and maybe some

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.420
money, but really we're going

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.840
to minimize that as much

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.700
as possible.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.380
We love helping dreamers because

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.340
we understand that situation,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.440
because we've all been in

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.520
that situation.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.740
You want to change your life but you don't

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.760
know what to do, you don't know

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.660
where to start, you're scared.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.760
Well we did it and now it makes

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.860
us really happy to share

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.220
this method we have learned

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.760
with people to help

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.100
them do the same.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.820
Now we go to entrepreneurs.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.860
With those who are already entrepreneurs

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.940
and this means with those who have taken

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.780
the first steps, they have already

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.460
assumed some risk, they have already

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.160
invested time, money and it doesn't

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.300
matter if you have raised a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.160
round with half a million euros or

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.820
you are making the website and you

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.560
have spent 3,000.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.580
It doesn't matter, the subject is, you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.240
are an entrepreneur if you have started,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.360
you have taken the first steps

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.620
but you haven't yet reached product

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520
market fit, it's that you don't

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.080
sell millions, you're not in that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.400
stage of scaling, but the important

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
thing is that, it's people who

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.640
are on the way and they are already

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.120
taking risk, so if there is a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.920
customer person for whom Power Launch

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.540
Formula is more than recommended,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.340
it's for these because they

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.620
are playing life.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.340
The one who has already taken his

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.660
first steps between doing things

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.580
well and ending up being a successful

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.980
entrepreneur with all that that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.660
means or having a profitable business

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.980
from which to live well as he

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.900
wants, to do things badly or

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900
to do things well and fail or that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.680
you have a business that is a suffering,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.980
that it is self-employment,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.460
that you are a slave of your

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.980
company, because it is to imagine

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.060
what changes the movie.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.400
We know hundreds of cases of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.620
entrepreneurs because we are close

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.540
to many and I want to make clear

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.380
one thing, almost all make the same

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.860
mistake and is that they are concerned

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.400
in this phase when they take the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.880
first steps before reaching Product

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.640
Market Feed, we say it to satiety

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.660
because it is very important,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.760
they are concerned about things

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.700
that are not important, they

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.780
are concerned about pushing that

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.020
product, for making better

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.700
campaigns, for making deals,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.800
for making noises in social

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.340
networks, for looking for suppliers,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.600
for technology, I don't know,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.220
for making a business plan, for

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.600
giving with a Business Angel,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.200
for making a pitch deck, is

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.780
that all that has no importance,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.640
the only thing that matters

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.120
to you and the only thing you

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.060
have to occupy until you

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.140
reach Product Market Feed

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.680
is to look for it and it's

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400
not what I say, it's what

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.960
people most know

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.140
By the way, and even if it is a

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.820
bit drastic, we do not want to

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.780
know anything about the projects

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.340
of entrepreneurs that do not make

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.460
Power Launch Formula and it is not

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.060
a topic to force people to buy it,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.420
but what you have to understand

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.500
is that when we help entrepreneurs

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.660
it implies an effort, then the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.780
minimum we demand is that the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.380
entrepreneur do everything in his

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.000
hand to do things well and in

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.680
this case it is very easy, what

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.620
he has to do is apply Power Launch

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.860
Formula and avoid making

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.220
the mistakes that everyone

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.440
makes and that we are seeing

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.220
that everyone is doing.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.520
We go with the third of the customer

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.580
person, many of the Power MBAs,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.420
a high percentage are entrepreneurs

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.020
and we call entrepreneur

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.460
all those who live from their company

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.400
or their business, there are some

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.300
who have a company that bills 100

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.360
million euros and there are others

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.440
that what they are freelance

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.000
and have small or that self-

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.900
employment, it doesn't matter.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.460
The issue is that for all these

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.880
Paints are the same, their challenges

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.700
are the same, regardless

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.460
of whether they charge 200 thousand

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.440
euros or 100 million, everyone

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.320
wants their company to grow,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.100
everyone wants to innovate,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.300
have larger companies

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.640
that scale, that value

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.740
more, etc.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.620
So, how will Power Launch Formula

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.580
help them?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.940
Because it will help them in different

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.600
ways, it will help them innovate within

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
their current model, because imagine

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.540
launching new products or

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.120
evolving something in their proposal,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.500
it will also help them to make more

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.360
drastic innovations within their business

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.960
model and it will help them to

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960
launch new companies, which

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.520
would be a greater degree of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.520
diversification.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.700
I think almost all

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.060
businessmen have a lot of

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.040
ideas when they

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.260
do the strategy area,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.500
when they use the business

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.160
model canvas, etc.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.100
Entrepreneurs are like that, we are

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.260
constantly thinking about doing different

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.960
things.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.720
Well, Power Launch Formula will help

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.160
you turn those ideas that have

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.780
come up with you into reality,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.940
maximizing the guarantees

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.960
of success.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.420
And finally, we go with the last of

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.260
the customer people, and it is what

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.600
we call managers, we do not call

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.700
them managers because they are managers,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.360
but because they are people who

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.460
want to have professional success

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.620
on behalf of others, who want

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.040
to speed up their professional

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.460
career, who want at some point to

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.020
have positions of responsibility,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.800
enjoy with what they do,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.180
be well paid, etc.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.320
It is easy to understand.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.280
Well, and I'll go back to the

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.360
previous three.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.480
The three previous are dreamer,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.700
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.300
They are all really playing it.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.480
Life will change if you do

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.760
things right or you are not

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.580
playing life.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.320
To all of these I really tell you that

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.800
it is crazy not to rely on Power Launch

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.820
Formula, not to take advantage of it.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.900
With the little effort it

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.860
takes in terms of time and money

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.740
is crazy not to do so.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.040
But for the executives, life won't

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.900
change them so much.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.380
I like to be completely honest.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.100
I highly recommend them to others.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.400
To managers, what I tell them is,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.840
if you like business, if you like

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.180
marketing, if you like innovation,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.060
if you want to be a more valuable

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.840
professional, support Power

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.820
Launch Formula.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.200
It is a very valuable knowledge, very

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.060
transformative.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.540
It won't change your life like

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.440
the previous ones.
