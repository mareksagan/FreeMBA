00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.470
We will compare two different approaches,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.610
which we can apply, for example, to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.070
market sizing, to the calculation

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.330
of the size of the market, but

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.050
which can be applied to estimates

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.610
of different types.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.690
Look, we start with the traditional

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.630
approach, which is the top-down approach,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.030
which is the one people usually

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.630
apply, and we see it in the Samsung

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.570
Time.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.730
What we do is from above, we start

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.490
from the total market, which we

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.170
will think, well, because they are

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930
200 million in the world.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.750
And what we do is to say, well,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.730
of those 200 million we can,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.850
our target market can be a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.390
10%, which is what we can

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.710
get, because by geographical

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.650
expansion, etc.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.650
It is 20 million.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.650
And we are applying hypotheses,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.930
and of those 20 million, that

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.510
is our target market, as we have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.350
a good proposal, etc., because

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.870
we can reach in the short

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.850
term, in the medium term,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.030
a quota of 10%, so we will

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.550
sell two million euros next

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.230
year.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.450
As you can see, it’s a rationale from

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.230
above down, which is something

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.970
you have to do.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.730
But what is happening to this?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.170
In many cases, it is what

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.430
we call the milk fairy tale

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.190
in Spain.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.710
The only thing that happens is that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.190
the paper supports everything, Excel

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.230
supports everything.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.970
You can put the numbers you want,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.650
put the hypotheses in Excel

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.330
and you get X million.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.150
This is very common, because that,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050
in financial projections, etc.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.890
So what we recommend is that,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.290
in addition to the top-down approach,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.270
we incorporate, or at least

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.350
make a check with a slightly

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.990
different reasoning, it

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.950
is a more inductive reasoning,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.950
which is of “Yes” in what consists

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.190
is that, instead of going from

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.390
above, which is the total market,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.170
the models, the market studies,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.510
etc., we start down and what we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.130
do is to fix ourselves or start

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.870
from concrete data from

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.110
the observation around us,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.470
the pace at which we are

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.690
capturing customers, what

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.070
is happening, what has happened

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.810
in the last year, etc.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.310
These are the most important points and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830
from there we can draw conclusions.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.510
From this point of view, we will be

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.510
able to extrapolate and reach the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.970
size of the market.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.290
You probably don’t understand

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.250
what I mean, but I’ll give you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.390
an example, a simple example.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.150
Put that we are a tax consultancy

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970
and then in the marketing plan we

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.310
are deciding that we want to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250
address a new segment of customers,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.850
which are startups.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.970
So what is the usual?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.870
Well, because the usual thing is to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.010
look for some information, imagine,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.390
and quantify a little the total of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.650
the market and we will do so in

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.310
terms of number of startups, of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610
companies, not in terms of business

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.430
volume.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.790
And we say, well, because there are

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.090
thousands of startups in Spain, for example,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.310
or there are thousands of startups to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.030
which we can access, this is our SAM,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.250
and we say, well, because as we have

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.330
resources, we have a good track record

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.470
and so on, we project that we will

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.010
capture the 10% by the figure that

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.350
is.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.710
As you can see, we start from above

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.670
and we are applying hypotheses, and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.830
at the end what can come out is that

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.590
you say, well, because I will capture

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.310
then 100 startups, that will be my

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.190
business in the medium term, in a year,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.190
two years, three years, whatever

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.610
it is.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.910
Well, you can believe it, but

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.610
now we will do it in reverse,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.310
now we will do it from below

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.470
up, then what we will do is, the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.990
first thing we will do is, instead

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.610
of thinking about offering

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.010
10 startups we know, to

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.430
10, and it turns out that of those

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.670
10 we buy one.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.050
We already have more reliable

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.550
information on what to build, we

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.370
have a 10% conversion rate

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.570
on all those to whom we tell the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.050
proposal, with whom we sit.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.670
Well, now let’s think, well, then,

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.230
and at what pace can we go capturing?

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.990


00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.830
For it turns out that we can capture,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.050
that is, at what pace can we

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.310
go having new meetings with,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.670
how many can we offer it?

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.350
We can offer it to 20 per

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.270
month.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.330
Well, if we have already tried

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.170
that of every 10 we tell, one buy

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.850
us and we can offer it to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.970
20 a month, in the end we can capture

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.730
two a month, which are 24

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.830
a year.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.630
In the first year we will capture

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.490
24 startups, which over the 1000

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.490
we were seeing, which is the total,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.970
is 2.4%, as you see, the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.710
data, as you see, the way to

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.210
reason them completely different.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.790
Rather than thinking about market

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.430
studies, aggregated data,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.210
etc., what we do is look around

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.350
and start from direct

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.030
observation.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.850
And we draw conclusions from that

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.210
direct observation and then

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.930
extrapolate and well, because

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.190
we can calculate the market

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.270
share we will have, etc.
