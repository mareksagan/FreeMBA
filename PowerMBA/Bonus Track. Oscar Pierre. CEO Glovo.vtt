00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.620
As you know, positioning

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.100
is a basic concept of

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.820
the basics of marketing.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.360
It's basically how you want to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.880
position yourself, how you want your customers

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.940
to perceive you.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.420
And I think that at Globo you have

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.060
a challenge, because Globo has the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.660
advantage that it has a huge variety

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.320
of services, not only a huge

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.540
variety of services, but a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.980
huge variety of values.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.140
That is, I could recommend Globo

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.540
to another person arguing different

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.400
values, that bring me something

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.380
I have asked from a friend's house,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.580
because I have left it, that they

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.700
will buy me a pizza, that I

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.180
can order food at home as if it

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.400
were an application of the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.600
traditional Food

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.840
Delivery, etc.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.280
So, you have the challenge of how

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.380
to position yourself in the minds

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.160
of users.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.680
How do you propose this?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.460
How can you, with this varied

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.640
offer, homogenize it?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.080
We have seen what works, when

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.200
at a very large growth

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.960
level, the channel or the user's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.400
road, we call your attention

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.720
with the message that it'

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.740
s an app that you can ask

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.760
for whatever you want.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.580
Anything at home.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.380
This is something that opens the user'

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.680
s mind, which makes the user also

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.940
talk about it, that when he comes

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.200
home he tells his partner, because

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.160
it is something very new.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
And if you look at our TV ads,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.480
our street ads, bus stops

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.140
and all this, the message is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.720
this, it's an app that you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.740
can ask for whatever you want.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.600
Then, it is very different what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.020
we call brand awareness to conversion.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.600
We are interested in people talking

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880
about us, that they have this picture

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.460
of the balloon in mind, that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.900
brings you anything, but when

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.440
we want to go investing in a user

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.160
making the first order, we impact

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.400
him a lot with food.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.620
We know that it is the channel, that

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.960
people eat three times a day, and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.380
it is the most recurring channel,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.020
the food.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.100
And because they did it three times.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.020
Many people have never

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.180
used an application.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.980
I said, I am at my brother'

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.400
s house, I forget something

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.540
and I won't go back.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.500
Madrid is a big city with many

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.660
shots, because it asks for a balloon

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.720
and brings it to me.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.720
But this so far we've never done,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.580
but we've all ordered food,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.560
so of course, it's easier to turn

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.500
it into helping you use something

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.380
you've already used.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.920
So, it is most important that the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.040
user has this first experience,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.660
that he has known the globe,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.640
that he has worked well.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.460
So, if you look at all the ads

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.660
we do, which are more of conversion,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.540
it usually is in impacts always

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.560
when you are on the mobile,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.620
or impacts on Facebook,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.280
on social networks.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.480
These are conversions.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.120
They are already users.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
Exactly, you are already looking for this

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.260
idea that you have of the balloon, that now that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.020
you are at home, asks.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.380
And then, everything we call CRM

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.700
comes in, which is all our program,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.420
there is a dedicated team that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.500
organizes all the newsletters,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.840
promotions, push notifications

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.140
within the globe,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.560
the content.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.840
And these take care of the user

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.180
asking for more, that is, they continue

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.960
to ask for retaining and also

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.500
discover new categories.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.120
Now, once you have the user

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.620
who already trusts you because we

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.620
have done a good service in food,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.240
it's easier to tell you, hear, why

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.620
don't you try us to order the pharmacy

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.820
when you need it, or to send

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.980
a envelope from the office,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.300
or to make the purchase?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.040
This afternoon if you need something.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.800
It is much easier to convince him

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.460
at that moment.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.840
Of course, effectively, when you

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.380
have it fidelized, you have already

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.800
paid with the card, you have your

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.480
data, it is much easier to grow

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.200
horizontally, to win off-

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.760
wallet, within each customer that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.660
you win it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.700
I would say, that is, for me, from

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.560
my perspective, positioning, I would

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.940
say that it is that globe makes

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.700
life easier.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.420
Not just bring me, as you said,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.740
we bring you, right?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.240
So, who is the officer?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.540
The first one?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.600
The first, the first impact.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.940
Anything at home.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.940
to home.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.360
I think this goes beyond.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.340
The slogan is actually us.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.900
What is this, right?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.760
We go for you.
