00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.330
The aim of today's class is

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.510
to be able to analyze a company'

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.050
s solvency and liquidity

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.550
from its financial statements.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.090
We will primarily use the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.030
balance sheet.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.150
Therefore, the first thing we

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.890
have to do is understand well what the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.310
definition of the term solvency and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.710
the term liquidity consists of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.630
and, in addition, know the differences

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.630
between them.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.060
On the one hand, solvency

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.900
measures the ability of

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.920
an enterprise to face long-

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.780
term debt repayment.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.200
What we will do in solvency

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.900
is to analyze the assets and analyze

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.880
the financial structure,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.140
liabilities, net worth,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.680
etc.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.260
As you can see, we are talking about

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.240
long-term.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.200
Liquidity, on the other hand,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.140
measures the ability of

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.560
a company to generate treasury

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.900
to face the return of short-

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.500
term debts.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.340
Therefore, the two main differences

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.660
are, in the case of solvency we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.840
talk of asset, we will consider

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.300
the entire asset, or the assets

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.240
of the company, the investments,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300
and in the case of liquidity we

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.200
do not talk of the asset itself,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.260
what we are talking is of the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.600
ability of those assets to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.040
generate treasury.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.660
In the case of solvency we

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.940
speak of long-term and in liquidity

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.640
we speak of short-term.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.120
Basically that is the difference.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.600
I will give you an example

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.480
of a family.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.160
We will think of a family whose

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.980
asset is basically a home

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.920
and the liability, 80% is indebted

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.660
because they asked for a mortgage

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.020
loan and 20% are own funds.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.800
If we analyze solvency, what we

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.820
have to compare is the asset with

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.720
the liability, etc.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.400
We will think, for example, that

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.560
in the 2008 crisis what happened

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.140
to this family is that, as the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.340
value of real estate goods

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.960
decreased very much, because it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.760
came a time when its asset is less

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.260
than its liability, that is,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.560
the asset, the value of the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.600
home is less than what remains

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.240
to pay.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.060
It is in a bankrupt situation.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.480
This is a solvency analysis,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.780
but if we analyze liquidity what

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.800
we will have to analyze is whether

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.740
that family is able to generate

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.240
treasury month by month to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.260
face the quota, the quota

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.140
that it has to pay every

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.460
month.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.740
As you can see, they are different perspectives.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.120
Now what we will do is look

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.540
at a series of ratios, which

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.380
are the ratios that are usually

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.120
used to analyze solvency

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.040
and to analyze liquidity.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.120
I know there are thousands of ratios.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.020
Really, if we investigate, if

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.740
we analyze what different

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.960
business schools, etc. share,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.860
on each site at the same ratios,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.160
in some cases they are called

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.640
differently, well, it

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.520
is really a mess.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.560
But what I want is that you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.020
understand more or less how

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.240
these ratios work and what are

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.060
the main ratios, the most common

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.760
ones.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.060
Let us start by measuring the solvency.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.940
What we do is, from the situation

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.400
balance sheet, we will analyze

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.240
the structure of assets,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.340
how we have funded

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.140
ourselves, etc.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.980
Let us compare the different

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.600
masses and start with the most well-

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.580
known of all, which is the indebtedness

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.780
ratio.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.680
It is very simple, it is very intuitive.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.460
In this case, what we will measure is

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.260
how much the debt weighs.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.980
In this case, we will consider

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.540
only the debt with cost or only

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.100
the financial debt.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.380
That is, we will take away the effect

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.680
of the spontaneous financing that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.720
would be the providers.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.760
Let's see how much the debt weighs

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.200
on the total of the sources of financing,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.680
which would be the liability plus

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.480
the asset elected.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.660
It is a percentage.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.440
The higher this percentage, the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.640
more indebted we are.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.740
And what is the implication of this?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.540
More debt, more risk

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.260
What happens is that, as we saw

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.480
in the classroom when

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.840
we analyzed the ROE,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.700
financial profitability, when you

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
borrow usually this what it does

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.980
is boost the profitability of

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.180
your own funds.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.780
Why is?

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.800
Because our partners had to make

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.060
a smaller investment.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.360
To draw conclusions about the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.840
debt ratio is very difficult.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.740
That is, we can say that an indebtedness,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.300
for example, of 50 percent is prudent,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.120
but really what needs to be

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.160
done is to analyze it by

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.900
sectors.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.760
That is, there are sectors

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.460
where a 50% debt can be low and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.680
in others it can be high, etc.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.020
So this ratio and many of which

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.120
we're going to really see what

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.340
we have to do is, what we

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.280
have to do is compare

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.380
them with competing companies.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.260
You can draw some conclusions.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.040


00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.020
If a company is much more indebted

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.660
than its competitors within

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.860
the same sector, well, because

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.960
it may be taking an excessive

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.380
risk.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.160
By the way, what we can do here

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.520
to calculate debt

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.120
is also to consider what percentage

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.240
of those debts are in

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.000
the long term.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.940
And so we can have a little more information

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.880
not only of how much you are

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.120
indebted, but also the quality

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.160
of that debt.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.100
The higher the amount of

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.000
long-term debt, the better.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.980
We could do this through two ratios.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.560
Instead of calculating the ratio

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.360
of total debt, we can also

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.620
calculate the ratio of short-

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.760
term debt and only take

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.540
short-term debt into account.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.420


00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.660
We divide it by the net

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.800
asset plus the total of

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.900
the assets.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.240
We do the same in the short and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.280
long term.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.460
And as he said, the higher the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.640
proportion of long-term

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.200
debt, the better.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.480
Another ratio for solvency

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.880
analysis is what is known

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.280
as solvency ratio.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.740
And in this case we return to the situation

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.900
balance sheet and what we will

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.340
compare is the total asset from another

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.180
perspective.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.460
The total asset is divided between the total

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.420
of the Y, in this case it is the reverse.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.820
The higher the solvency ratio,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.480
the greater the solvency.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.020
We first settle the debt.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.720
Now we measure it from another perspective.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.420
And I say that I cannot draw

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.980
any conclusions.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.460
We must always contextualize the data

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.120
we provide.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.710
Now we will look at the liquidity of

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.350
the company.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.430
We also refer to the concept of liquidity.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.150
It is the ability to generate

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.470
treasury to deal with

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.970
short-term debt repayments.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.870
It is a treasure concept.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.110
We will do this primarily with

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.030
three ratios.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.820
Let us go back to the balance sheet.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.800
Remember the background of the maneuver.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.900
The fund of maneuver is the

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.320
difference between the current

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.280
asset, i.e., the asset that will generate

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.660
treasury in a period of less than

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.440
one year, and the current liability,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.600
which are debts with a period

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.020
of expiry less than one year.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.360


00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.760
Well, in this case we will do it is to

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.220
analyze the background of manoeuvre

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.600
by means of a ratio that we call

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.560
the ratio of the background of manoeuvre.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.220
The current asset is divided

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.460
between the current passive.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.460
The higher the ratio of the fund

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.020
of manoeuvre, the greater the liquidity

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.200
of the company.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.360
Basically, if the ratio is higher

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.500
than one, the current asset

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.920
is higher than the current liability

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.400
and in theory we will have

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.960
enough liquidity to pay off

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.040
the debts.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.840
If the ratio is less than

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.640
one, this means that the

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.840
current liability is

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.680
higher than the current

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.060
asset.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.700
In theory, we will have

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.560
trouble with repaying the debt.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.100
However, the interpretation we have

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.060
to do and what we have to know is

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.300
that it is not always so, that

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.260
is, there are companies that can

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.560
afford to have a negative manoeuvre

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400
fund.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.600
And we will go back to the class

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.040
where we analyzed the operational

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.660
needs of funds and analyzed

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.120
the working capital cycle or

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.480
the cycle of the fund of manoeuvre.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.060
And remember that there were companies,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.660
for example, the one we have

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.800
on screen, which is a supermarket,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.440
in which the company's operations

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.740
were actually funding

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.080
the activity.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.880
Remember in this case that

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.960
we bought goods, the rotation

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.400
is very high, the 30 days

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.020
the goods were sold, we

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.580
charged in cash but

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.440
we were paying suppliers

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.400
within 90 days.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.620
So, the company's operations

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.120
were funding us

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.880
for 60 days.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.240
It is a case where the background of

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.660
manoeuvre is negative, the NOVs are negative.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.040
In this case, if we go to the balance

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.580
sheet, the balance of suppliers is

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.380
greater than the balance of stocks

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.000
and customers.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.260
Therefore, as we are seeing, the background

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.620
of manoeuvre in this case is negative

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.600
and the ratio of the background of

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.000
manoeuvre is less than one.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.080
In addition, there are two other ratios

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.620
that help us measure liquidity and

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.700
what we do is to be increasingly conservative,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.520
that is, in the ratio of the

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.760
fund of manoeuvre we have taken

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.040
into account all the current

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.240
asset and compared it with the

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
current liability.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.260
Now we are going to

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.780
be more conservative,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.120
more liquid.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.020
The acid test is known

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.680
as acid test, usually

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.420
acid test in English.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.300
In this case, what we do is instead

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.240
of considering all the current

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.060
asset, what we do is take

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.260
away the stocks.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.780
We will not depend on stocks,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.860
we do not know what will happen,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.480
we do not know what will be

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.420
their rotation, etc.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.780
We will be more cautious.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.440
So what we do is current asset

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.200
less stocks divided

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.920
into current passive.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.240
Or we will be even more

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.800
cautious, even more demanding,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.880
and what we will do is to directly

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.340
compare the treasury we have

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.960
today in cash with short-

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520
term debt.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.340
As you can imagine, this ratio

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.640
is going down as we take

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.840
away the games.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.980
Each time we stay with the most

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.720
liquid items and in this case we

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.860
will compare that, treasury

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.560
with current liabilities.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.420
I will make a summary.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.200
We must be able to analyze

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.780
solvency and liquidity.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.620
Solvency is a longer term concept

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.040
and liquidity is a short

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.900
term.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.480
We use a number of

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.180
ratios.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.940
There is a ratio, for example, well

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.920
known, which is the ratio of

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.080
indebtedness, which we will measure

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.920
is the percentage of the total of

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.060
the sources of financing, the percentage

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.480
that is debt.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.100
The more indebted we are, the more

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.680
risk there is, but on the other

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.820
hand, from the perspective

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.580
of profitability, borrowing

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.140
boosts profitability.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.900
We will also measure solvency from

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.060
another perspective, which is

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.940
to compare assets with the total

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.640
liabilities.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.960
So, the higher this ratio the

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.580
more solvent we will be.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.240
And to analyze liquidity, which

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.920
is a concept related to treasury,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.140
what we will use is, for example,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.500
three ratios.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.540
The most well-known is the ratio

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.820
of the fund of manoeuvre, in which

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.640
we will divide the current asset

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.040
between the current liability, but

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.080
we can be increasingly restrictive

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.820
and we can, for example,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.300
use the ratio of the acid test,

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.240
which is that in this case,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.640
instead of taking the entire

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.420
current liability, we will

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.520
rest the stocks.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.260
Or we can be even more demanding

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.320
and consider only the most liquid

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.680
part, which is the treasury

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.440
we have today in the box.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.320
We will divide it between the

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.240
current passive.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.440
All these ratios, all these

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.940
ratios indicate the number

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.640
of times, because we are dividing

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.260
the number of times, that our

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.620
assets are able to cover

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.080
current liabilities.
