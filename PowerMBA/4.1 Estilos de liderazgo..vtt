00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
To finish, and this is perhaps the most important of all, is that as I was saying, styles are not good or bad.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.200
What we have to understand well is, and it is an exercise that you have to do,

00:17.200 --> 00:24.200
is depending on the situation in which you are, the context of your type of work, etc.

00:24.200 --> 00:30.200
Now we are going to see depending on which variables, we have to do the analysis of which style is most suitable.

00:30.200 --> 00:40.200
And I am convinced that if you do the diagnosis you will realize that in many cases styles that are not suitable for the situation are applied.

00:40.200 --> 00:52.200
We are going to use, in this case, a matrix, which seems to me to be very simple and that is why it helps us to locate or identify in what situation we are.

00:52.200 --> 00:59.200
Or is in our work. And we are going to do it according to the variables.

00:59.200 --> 01:10.200
On the one hand, we have in the axis of the Y, we are going to classify the tasks or functions that you are developing in your team,

01:10.200 --> 01:21.200
depending on whether at one end, imagine tasks that are very high repetition, in which everything is very procedimental,

01:21.200 --> 01:26.200
that you can contribute very little, that you know exactly what each person has to do, etc.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.200
I give you the extreme example, which is understood well when we go to extremes.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.200
The extreme example of a production chain, in a factory.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.200
There is little to do here, basically what you have to do is execute it.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.200
That is one extreme. And the other extreme, which would it be?

01:42.200 --> 01:52.200
Well, in which the repetition is very low, in which there is a lot of ability to create, the value is in that, many times in being more innovative, etc.

01:52.200 --> 01:57.200
This is the scale on the axis of the Y, okay?

01:57.200 --> 02:03.200
And on the axis of the X, what we are going to think is, until now we were thinking about the type of task,

02:03.200 --> 02:06.200
and now we are going to think about the people we have in the team, okay?

02:06.200 --> 02:10.200
And we are going to classify them according to the capacity of autonomy.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.200
What do I mean by this?

02:12.200 --> 02:22.200
Let's think about the extreme of when autonomy is very high, they are usually very proactive people,

02:22.200 --> 02:30.200
with more professional experience, who do not need so much knowledge, they already have it, who like to contribute, etc.

02:30.200 --> 02:37.200
And on the other hand, when the capacity of autonomy is lower, well, it is the opposite, right?

02:37.200 --> 02:45.200
People who, because they do not have the capacity or do not want to, do not have so much autonomy, they like it more,

02:45.200 --> 02:52.200
they prefer to be given the most difficult tasks, not having to worry every morning about what they have to do,

02:52.200 --> 02:56.200
they need more support because they need more knowledge, etc.

02:57.200 --> 03:05.200
So we have the two axes, the axis of the X, which we talked about according to the members of the team,

03:05.200 --> 03:12.200
and the axis of the Y according to the type of task, and what we are going to do is determine different situations

03:12.200 --> 03:16.200
and which are the most convenient leadership styles.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.200
And we go with it, we go with both extremes, okay?

03:20.200 --> 03:28.200
Let's think that the tasks are very repetitive, there is little to create here, and also you have the members of your team

03:28.200 --> 03:35.200
who do not want to have autonomy, what they want is to give them things well marked, they do not have much knowledge, etc.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.200
Which do you think is the style that best fits in this case?

03:38.200 --> 03:44.200
Well, here what best fits is that you are authoritarian, that whatever you say is done,

03:44.200 --> 03:51.200
like a clock that looks for efficiency, that you do not give much freedom to the members of your team, etc.

03:51.200 --> 03:57.200
And the extreme is again a chain of assembly, an industrial chain.

03:57.200 --> 04:03.200
Here there is little to innovate, you determine the rules, the schedules, zero flexibility,

04:03.200 --> 04:05.200
whatever you say is done and period.

04:05.200 --> 04:12.200
And we go to the opposite extreme, we are going to think that the tasks are very creative,

04:12.200 --> 04:17.200
that there is very little repetition, that it takes a lot of creativity, that really the key is in that.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.200
And I'm going to give you two examples, imagine that you are building a company from scratch,

04:21.200 --> 04:28.200
in which everything is to be created, you do not have product market fit yet, you have to create, you have to think, you have to innovate,

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
you still do not know what is going to happen.

04:30.200 --> 04:35.200
In this case you can not be executing because you do not know what you have to execute, you have to create.

04:36.200 --> 04:42.200
Or we are going to think, for example, that you sell strategic consulting projects and that each project is a world,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
it is a blank sheet.

04:44.200 --> 04:50.200
Well, here the key is that you can not execute from the first day because you still do not know what to do, the key is to create.

04:50.200 --> 05:01.200
And you also have members of your team who are quite senior people, not by age but by level, very proactive,

05:01.200 --> 05:06.200
in which they contribute a lot to you and you do not have much to contribute to them, etc.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.200
What would be the style that best suits in this case?

05:10.200 --> 05:14.200
Well, the opposite of the authoritarian, the most delegative style.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.200
In this case you can leave them freedom because they are people who are going to fulfill, okay?

05:18.200 --> 05:23.200
And they will be more comfortable in that environment, you will get more of them.

05:23.200 --> 05:29.200
And in the rest of the situations, almost this is a disaster drawer, but it is what makes sense,

05:29.200 --> 05:37.200
in the most normal situations, not so extreme, well, the way to get the most out of your team is, in the end,

05:37.200 --> 05:43.200
the democratic style, which is generally the one that works best, because it is a more balanced style,

05:43.200 --> 05:46.200
in which you are going to make the decisions but you are going to rely on them,

05:46.200 --> 05:49.200
you are going to get in this way that they are more motivated, etc.
