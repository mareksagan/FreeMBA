00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.200
Pedro, the personal brand is something

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
very relevant, as you have demonstrated

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.400
yourself with what you are telling

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.040
us, with your experience and with

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.180
your baggage, but people barely work it.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.680
What would you say?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.100
What recommendations would you give them?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.120
I believe that personal branding

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.260
today is something that is

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.160
a reality and that is fundamental

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.820
for anyone.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.280
I have a phrase that I like a lot

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.920
and it is, there are no second

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.340
chances for first impressions,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.340
whether you want to connect, that

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.680
you want to find work, that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.360
you are looking for a partner

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.060
or that you are trying to

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.940
hire people.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.760
Personal branding is the beginning

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.540
of any relationship.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.640
What would you say to people?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.000
We are not aware of the transparency

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.280
of any profile on the networks,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.020
whether your personal networks,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.440
your professional networks,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.500
we even leave a trace of the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.240
content we see, what we read

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.780
and the products we want

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.020
to buy or not.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.360
Personal brand, in the end, is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.280
very important for everyone, there

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.500
are very few people who work

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.200
it and those who work it or

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.660
we see benefited directly from

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.480
that shortage to the market,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.420
we do not give importance to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.320
what we transmit of ourselves.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.020
What do you think are the keys or

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.600
guidelines that you could give a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.420
person the advice to carry out

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.320
a real and feasible plan, to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.000
build from scratch, I don't talk

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.320
to you from a negative area that

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.080
needs to depurate a reputation,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.920
but yes from scratch, a personal

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.960
brand?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.520
What are the lines of action

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.900
you would recommend?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.020
Well, I think my first recommendation

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.820
is not just being, but appearing,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.300
would work a lot on visual content,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.060
images, whether there are videos,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.800
what kind of videos there are,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600
what information we share, whether

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.640
we are friends of people or not,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.040
share our connections on LinkedIn,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.660
have the public, private profile.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.430
First step for me, images, second

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.060
step content, third step, tastes,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.140
affinities, leave our digital

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.660
footprint on those sites we

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.200
want you to know we have

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.060
on the radar.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.940
One thing that professionally people

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.580
do not do much is validate the skills,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.120
that people validate you, have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.280
good recommendations,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.800
follow those brands that represent

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.300
you or with which you feel

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.520
somehow identified, and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.600
gradually go sowing in what

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.760
we want to be or look

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.700
like in the digital environment.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.460


00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.960
It is not 100% what you are,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.320
but what you want to convey.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.280
Today, in the digital age, which

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.800
is already a reality,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.700
we can become almost anyone.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.700
I could make myself look like

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
a rock star, I could make myself

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.660
look like a mathematician or even

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.400
a businessman.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.340
Then, personal branding opens doors

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.820
to you and then you are the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.400
one who has to, in some way, be

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.120
up to those opportunities.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.780
Then, image, content, connections,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.280
information, and then already

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.860
affinities or that trace we

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.500
are leaving.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.360
You were talking about content and today

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.400
there is infinite amount of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.480
content on the network.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.380
What do you consider to be

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.400
most valuable?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.300
Those people who are at the latest

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.560
at the reception and share certain

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.440
content that is supposed to

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.100
be of your interest or people

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.140
who develop from scratch content,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.020
generate opinion, generate posts,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.240
write articles on a topic,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.720
have a personal blog,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.020
what is more powerful?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.560
Or both, what do you think?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.120
I think it's a mix of everything.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.120
They are not looking for

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.040
zero-content creators or people

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.460
who just share news.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.360
It is always a mix.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.170
It all depends on what type of profile

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.390
you are looking for, you

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.910
are trying to represent.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.010
In the end, it is important to be faithful

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.290
to your content.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.870
If you are a writer who publishes

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.010
your own content or shares

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.930
content that represents you and

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.010
you feel somehow linked to that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.330
content, and if you are a Kik who

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.650
has to be up to date with the news,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.270
note that the news you share

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.030
is because they have value for

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.490
that network of contacts

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.030
with which you are sharing it.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.530
In the end, it is not about

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.550
quantity, but quality and consistency.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.730
There are a lot of people who share a lot

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.350
of content the week that they are

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.350
looking for work and then stop doing it.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.370
So, if you work within a company

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.530
and human resources people detect

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.990
this, they may even realize

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.170
that that person is

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.750
looking for work.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.990
You must be constant and

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.350
be consistent with what

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.090
you do.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.270
There are a lot of people trying

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.550
to appear, but you actually notice

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.050
what's good about doing something

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.470
for a bit by reviewing your story.
