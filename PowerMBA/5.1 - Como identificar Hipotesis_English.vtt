00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.480
One of the key factors to succeed,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.340
to minimize risks and maximize

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.440
chances of success when

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.940
we are undertaking or when

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.200
we are creating any product

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.620
or any business model that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.040
has a certain degree of uncertainty

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.000
or innovation

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.420
is to have a lot of practice

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.160
identifying the main

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.320
hypotheses.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.260
What are the chances?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.960
Well, because hypotheses are those

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.940
beliefs or those acts of faith

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.340
or those assumptions that you

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.180
are doing but that we really

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.940
do not yet have the proof, the practical

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.460
and real proof that it will

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.040
be so.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.640
You believe that the customer will

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440
behave in a certain way, you believe

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.700
that he will be willing to pay x,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.740
you believe that you will be able to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.120
reach the customer through this channel,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.300
etc.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.340
You believe it because you haven’t

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.420
proved it yet.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880
Therefore, in hypotheses there

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.780
must be this component of uncertainty,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.220
that is, there are hypotheses

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.960
that are actually absolutely

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.040
validated.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.600
I would put a case, if you mount a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.700
bar on the most transit street of your

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.320
city, because it is clear that by

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
that street, by your escaparat, etc.,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.220
thousands of people will pass by your local.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.600
You do a market research and you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.460
know, it’s not a hypothesis that

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.680
you really have to validate in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.800
advance, because there is no longer

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.880
uncertainty about it.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.700
The criterion of the hypotheses is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.560
that we still do not have evidence

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.320
to determine it.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.900
We will help a lot the link both

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.760
because what allows you is to describe

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.980
your business model and helps you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.620
not to leave hypotheses because

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.200
you have the visibility of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.160
all the factors.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.680
I think mostly the hypotheses,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.040
there are several classifications

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.100
but I would classify

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.260
them in four.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.140
The first is the value-related

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.220
hypotheses, with which we are

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.880
able to create value to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.500
customers.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.420
They perceive it.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.760
There is a possibility related to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.420
who those customers are.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.280
We believe our customers will

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920
be, since a certain segment,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.340
but we will have to prove it.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.620
Another very important hypothesis

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.960
is the one related to growth,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.140
with how we will be able to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
reach those customer segments.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.940
And finally I would say that there can

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.480
be a group of hypotheses that are

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.900
related to the profitability of the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.180
model, with the income and with the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.160
remains, with which we eventually

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.180
make money.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.880
To make you understand how

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.620
the practice works or what level

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.060
of detail this hypothesis

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.160
identification analysis is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.080
carried out, I will share with

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.780
you a brief analysis of Power MBA,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.180
of what are the hypotheses we

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.280
are facing initially, many of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.680
which we have already validated.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.420
As you will see, all the hypotheses

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.640
begin, I have described them

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.240
with believing that, because they

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.820
are really beliefs, they are beliefs

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.220
that we had and that many,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.260
as I tell you, are already validated.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.100
Well, the first hypothesis or the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.700
first belief is that there is a problem

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.300
or that there was a problem.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.720
Innovative models usually

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.760
have to start from a problem,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.700
from a problem that has

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880
not yet been given an

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.740
optimal solution.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.600
And what we believe is that traditional

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.520
education programs do not

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.500
respond to the needs of a lot

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080
of people for a number of reasons,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.620
because they are, because it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.020
requires a high investment, because

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.140
it requires a lot of dedication,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.300
etc., because they are

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.520
not updated.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.580
It is a belief that we

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.860
had from which we built

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.220
the rest of the model.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.280
In addition, and to determine how

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.680
important the hypothesis of the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.500
size of the market, who our customers

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.280
are, is in this case, we believe

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.780
that millions of people

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.960
around the world have this

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.380
problem.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.700
As you can see, this is

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.140
something absolutely determining, this

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.120
absolutely determining hypothesis

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.260
of the size of the business,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.920
the attractiveness that you eventually

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.360
have of Power MBA and the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.320
rating that you can.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.500
We believe that there are millions of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.900
people in the world, but we will

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.560
have to prove it and depending on

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.840
whether we demonstrate it or not, because

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.540
Power MBA will be worth more or less.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.840
In addition, a very important

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.680
belief is that we have been

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680
able to create a proposal that

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.200
will solve those problems.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.380
We think the proposal will

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.000
be attractive, we have

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.340
verified it.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.380
In addition, here I recommend in this

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.880
case that the analysis of the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.220
hypotheses do it with a certain

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.100
level of detail because you can provide

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.120
certain solutions, certain

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.700
functionalities, for example,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.420
of your product, etc., but you would

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.280
need to validate them separately

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.600
because it may be that not all

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.780
of them provide and build it, remove

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.940
it from the proposal, make

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.040
a cleaner proposal, a

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.800
clearer message, etc.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.960
In our case, the components that

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.480
give solution to those problems is

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.140
a very affordable price, the fact

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.600
that you can study very conveniently

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.180
15 minutes a day on any device,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.020
etc., and in addition we

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.020
have incorporated the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.980
analysis of the cases of professionals

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.940
with great success.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.200
These are the components that

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.980
we believe will solve those

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.180
problems that we had previously

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.570
identified.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.170
Well, in addition to this and

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.870
it is something very important

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.230
in our case, we had the hypothesis

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.230
that in addition to our objective

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.850
customers would perceive as very

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.070
attractive the proposal, that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.010
we validated it very quickly

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.150
when we went out to the market,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.570
we had to validate other

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.030
hypotheses, that really once

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.470
you have students or clients,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.610
in our case is students, we

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.490
would be able to make students

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.150
happy by a series of factors,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.510
which we also had to validate

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.110
them separately too.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.710
Well, then, that students perceive

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.990
that they are learning really,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.870
that they are acquiring knowledge

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.110
that is useful in their professional

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.030
career.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.310
We had to validate another of the

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.470
values and it is that the

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.550
students will consider it

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.970
entertaining, fun.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.970
As you can see, they are all beliefs,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.770
because they are before you have come

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.950
out to the market, you have no idea,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.830
you think it will be so, you believe

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.030
you will be able to build a product

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.270
that results in this case entertaining,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.770
but you have not yet validated

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.630
it.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.110
And it’s also very convenient and I

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.330
recommend that you make many hypotheses

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.970
that you can convert them into metric.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.890
For example, we believed from

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.410
the beginning, since we drew

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.130
the business model, that about

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.790
70% or at least 70% of that

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.850
is much higher ratio than

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.430
other digital programs,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.970
to other online programs

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.710
like on the MOOC platforms.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.670
A very important metric and

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.630
a very powerful hypothesis regarding

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.970
very related to the value

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.050
we would be able to deliver.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.730
Or, for example, a very important

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.090
hypothesis is usually the percentage

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.630
of your customers who will recommend

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.050
you, also related to the

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.670
value.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.230
And we have always wanted

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.290
at least 40% of our clients,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.590
our students, to recommend

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.150
us throughout the

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.190
program.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.070
I’m going to convey a hypothesis

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.210
that is related to competitive

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.790
advantage or entry

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.970
barrier, with what makes

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.210
us truly unique.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.450
We thought we would be able to

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.670
have the collaboration

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.830
of numerous figures, who would

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.490
help us create a very entertaining,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.930
very enriching program.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.690
At the initial moment it was just a

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.110
belief, we had to validate it and

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.810
we validated it.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.050
We can do this because we

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.750
have adapted the strategy to it.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.350
So far we have seen hypotheses

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.610
that are mainly qualitative,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.190
hypotheses related

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.730
to value, the attractiveness

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.470
that potential customers

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.330
see, the value that you are

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.550
finally able to deliver, etc.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.610
But it is very important

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.270
that you identify and make the

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.610
main metrics of your business

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.770
hypotheses.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.210
The main ones, those that will determine

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.370
whether you have a business model

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.250
that makes sense or not.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.390
And in our case they

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.490
are mainly related to the

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.250
ability to grow profitably.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.750
And what are they?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.610
So, we can get a number

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.770
of leads per month.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.650
For example, we put 10,000 leads per month.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.410
If the cost of 10,000 leads in students

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.690
is a bit of a percentage,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.070
we put it at 10%.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.570
The cost of customer

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.410
acquisition is X.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.070
It is a data and it is a very important

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.650
hypothesis because if the cost of

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.270
capture is higher than what you

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.510
get for each student, you are not

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.710
paying money and your business

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.630
model is meaningless.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.130
Or, for example, that your organic

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.330
growth, which is not paid,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.650
is a yearly percentage on

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.090
customers.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.250
As you can see, these are the main

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.110
metrics that we have to convert into

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.630
concrete hypotheses, which are concrete

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.750
beliefs, which we will have to validate

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.070
as soon as possible.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.630
It will determine whether

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.810
it makes sense or not.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:06.630
How will we validate it?

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.390
We will test it with

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.190
very quick tests.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.470
All the hypotheses we have identified,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.970
what we have to do is create

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.170
an organization that is as

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.350
agile as possible to go validating

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.190
them.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.610
We can validate them together

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.270
or we can validate them through

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.610
concrete experiments for

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.190
each of the concrete hypotheses.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.230
But the sooner we do it and spend

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.310
the least money possible,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.790
the better.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.050
Sooner we know.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.010
Whether we are wrong in these

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.050
beliefs or not, much

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:35.910
better.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.850
Because we’ll be closer to

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.950
having a business model that

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.010
finally makes sense.
