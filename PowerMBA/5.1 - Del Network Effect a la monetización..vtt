00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.150
For example, Wallapop was born.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.130
We are starting to think about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.430
what can work in Spain.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.790
At that time, five or six years ago,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.470
we wanted to do something in the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.750
second hand world and that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.350
was mobile.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.250
Now it is obvious, but then it

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.450
wasn't, we are the first to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.590
bet on a mobile solution.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.470
And from that we defined Wallapop's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.190
business model, seeing

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.990
other things that had worked

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.710
around the world.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.370
The truth is that Wallapop interests

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.790
us a lot because it is a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.890
company that I think we are

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.170
all users of.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.990
I sold it, I bought it.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.750
I think the value to the customer

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.970
is undeniable, undoubted, spectacular.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.030
And I know that it is a company that has

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.750
been talked about, that there has

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.150
been noise in relation to going

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.310
to find the business model, they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.910
will end up having a model that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.310
is sustainable.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.570
This noise has been heard from many companies.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.990
Spotify has been mentioned, and many

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.290
companies have been mentioned.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.430
And I, it's a personal issue of mine,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.690
I think that when a company is able

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.110
to bring so much value, it will cost

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.510
you more, it will have to raise more

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.590
rounds.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510
But it is very difficult that you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.310
don't end up building a business

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.670
model that is profitable.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.970
There may be some evidence

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.690
that shows that what I am

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.130
saying is not always true.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.490
But I tend to think that it is so,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.310
because Wallapop is that you use it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.630
once and you realize the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.870
difference really of what it brings

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.510
in relation to what there was

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.390
or what it has any other similar

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.110
platform.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.210
So if you could tell us how you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.570
overcame the Wallapop challenge,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.410
because it's a model where

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.650
you had to grow only for

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.290
a while, you had to finance

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.150
absolutely all the growth without

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.170
getting anything because

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.030
you weren't monetizing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.610
users.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.290
Yes, we at Antaim have launched

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.990
this process, five years ago

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.110
that we launched Antaim, we have

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.610
launched 15 companies.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.870
Our factory works to launch

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.330
three companies with these entrepreneurs

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.670
a year, basically.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.210
Three.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.750
Three.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.190
And above all we have made companies

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.250
in the mobile world, where we have

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.050
a lot of experience, such as Wallapop,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.590
CornerJob, Globo, which comes from

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.910
a merger with JazzBell.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.730
I told you that I was with Oscar

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.990
yesterday.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.330
As a Delivery.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.090
Most of all we have done things

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.150
in the field of classified,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.250
the collaborative economy,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.350
that is, second hand in Wallapop,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.250
employment in CornerJob, we have

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.990
had the opportunity to also

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.210
participate in Globo, where we

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.250
do more topics of Delivery in general,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.770
of Convenience, the whole

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.010
line of supermarket fresh

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.050
food we do in Delivery, we

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.270
have a marketplace of cars

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.050
like Carnovo, then in

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.730
general we have a lot of

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.030
experience in classified

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.210
and we are very demetric people.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.930
If there was something that students

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.070
had to stay, I think it is the concept

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.390
that there are many where the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.170
relevant thing in the early stages is

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.210
not so much the generation of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.690
revenue, but the metrics of use,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.190
the power to see how much it costs

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.370
you to acquire a customer, what

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.670
organic percentage you have, and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.990
what loyalty that people have, when

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.030
I refer to organic, how many

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.270
customers come to you by a mouth-

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.450
ear and without cost at the level

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.730
of acquisition, customers users,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.510
and how you retain, and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.530
these are the first things we

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.910
see in each of the companies

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.830
to try to predict the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.090
success of how they progress.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.950
And in particular in the world of

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.910
the classified, where we have these

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.330
three experiences like Wallapop, CornerJob

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.570
or Carnovo itself, there is a theory,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.170
I say it for entrepreneurs, behind

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.830
there is a rational of this process

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.090
in the world of the classified,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.650
and it is that the concept that

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.150
the winner takes all, and that therefore

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.950
there is a single winner, and that

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.930
you need to be at least two or

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.210
three or four years generating

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.030
a recurring user base and liquidity,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.430
both in the classified the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.610
key is both the supply

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.070
and demand compensated, and when

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.790
you already have that, and you are

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.410
the undisputed leader in those

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.850
concepts, in those metrics

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.330
then, when you enter three

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.990
or four years later in the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.790
phase of monetization without

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.650
rival, and it is when you

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.650
can make those services

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.850
go to monetize, but first you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.850
have to have created all

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.390
that base.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.990
And when you're there, then

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.210
you have a tremendous life generation

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.070
ability.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.170
An unavoidable barrier to entry.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.530
Insaferable and a brutal generation

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.770
of life, because it is an

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.270
absolutely digital company, in which

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.570
the world's top ranked who have

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.470
achieved this position work with

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.770
percentages of living on income

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.390
of 70 percent or 80 percent.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.350


00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.070
I love what you said, because

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.330
in one of our classes we talked

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.830
exactly about this, how the network

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.710
effect leads to the winner takes

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.750
all, that we have used it as such,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050
and it is what happens because

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.430
the companies that grow earlier,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.190
that virtuous circle of more

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.750
users, more value, more value,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.150
makes them catch momentum

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.530
and the rest is left out.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.150
And when you already have that,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.730
and users can't afford you, so

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.750
much, let's say, and at least

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.190
go if you want classified terminology,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.490
both supply and demand, listers,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.670
both those who publish things

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.030
as those who buy them, then

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.530
it's time to monetize and

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.610
charge for that service when

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.690
there is no alternative,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.650
let's say, in the market.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.930
That's a trajectory that the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.930
world's top ranking have launched

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.230
and it has worked.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.290
And not only in the classified,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.430
in general all social networks, which

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.150
are also based on the business,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.210
it is the same, it analyzes a

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.470
little what Facebook did the years

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.050
it took to monetize, but then

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.770
when it has been put to

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.790
monetize, since it is a growth machine.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.870
What does LinkedIn do as a social work?

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.910
The same.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.750
Whenever there is a network...

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.770
Twitter is the same.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.290
It is true that then each of those

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.310
projects, until you are monetizing

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.670
it, you don't know what the real

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.050
potential of income generation is

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.650
and, for example, because we see

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.450
this very well in listed

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.910
companies like Facebook, Twitter

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.690
or LinkedIn, where the evolution

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.170
of Facebook quote indicates

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.890
that Facebook has been able

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.670
to break the forecasts

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.050
of income generation.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.390
LinkedIn is there

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.670
too.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.730
Facebook is easy to understand.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.710
How much money?

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.730
You will not tell me.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.590
We spend a bit of money on

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.490
Facebook every month.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.010
I don't even want to tell

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.510
you the money.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.770
How can a Facebook account not be

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.910
worth a dollar if we don't all

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.110
spend a dollar on advertising?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.130
of course.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.890
Then then, obviously, time

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.810
tells you if that income potential

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.750
can go how far.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.050
And that's then what marks the ratings

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.390
of companies like Facebook or Twitter,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.690
where Facebook has, for example,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.570
made a bigger progress that

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.950
has been made on Twitter, by

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.910
the potential power that it has

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.730
then been able to launch the

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.750
company.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.590
I would like to give you a thought

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.630
about what Michael Williams said.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.070
As you can see, we were asking for

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.330
Wallapop.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.890
Because Wallapop is a company

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.410
that has grown from its inception

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.630
to a lot of users, it provides

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.910
a huge value, but for a long

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.090
time it has been questioned whether

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.050
it would become a profitable

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.130
business model.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.010
And why?

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.990
Why is this given?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.770
Well, because the issue is that on

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.330
platforms the fact of creating network

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.210
effect, the fact of creating value

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.550
to users does not imply that

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.350
you will always find a profitable

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.490
business model.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.070
This is different than in a linear model.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.350
In a linear, traditional model, you

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.790
do what you do is cobras based

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.330
on the value you create.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.750
You sell a customer, you bring value

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.870
and you pay for it.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.390
On a platform it is very different, because

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.850
we have to put ourselves on a lot

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.790
of things.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.230
Who creates value or who creates

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.670
value for?

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.410
Sometimes there are different users.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.590
Who is creating value for each

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.230
other?

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.810
To whom can you charge?

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.070
Or when?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.390
When is a very important topic.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.210
Miguel told us that they for a

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.890
long time in the case of Wallapop

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.930
and in some other case initially

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.530
did not monetize, did not charge

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.830
anyone until they reached

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.550
the network effect or the critical

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.350
mass.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.890
This is a very important topic.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.770
Why is it?

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.010
Because you have in mind that the

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.230
goal is to generate a greater critical

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.390
mass, is to generate more value

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.270
to users, etc.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.470
And charging from the beginning

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.910
or charging in general can be, it

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.990
doesn't have to be, but it can be

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.610
counterproductive.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.330
Why is it?

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.170
Because you are creating entrance barriers.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.410
If you charge users, there

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.510
may be fewer users who

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.990
sign up, so you're not

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.230
doping that circle.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.050
And we must find balance.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.190
In the case of Michael, what did he recommend?

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.330
Well, because when customers can no

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.110
longer live without you, start charging them.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.050
Another issue to consider is the

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.190
value of interactions.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.970
Sometimes when you collect, you

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.530
get interactions to be more valuable.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.610
I will give you an example.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.270
Let us look at the case of the meeting.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.610
Meetup is a platform, now mainly

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.530
used in the application,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.570
born in 2003, in desktop

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.410
format.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.410
It's an app that allows you

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.990
to upload a Meetup, which

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.050
is an event.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.550
You are proposing an event.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.450
You can do sports in the park.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.930
People are there and you are organizing

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.690
the event.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.010
And it had much growth from the

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.470
beginning, but its monetization

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.910
strategy failed.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.450
They started trying to generate

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.550
leads for local.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.950
If I, for example, organized an

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.750
event to talk and learn English,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.750
the bar was the one who paid

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.690
for that lead.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.130
This did not work.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.630
They tried to monetize that entire

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.110
audience through advertising, but

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.810
there wasn't enough traffic at

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.350
that time, etc., and there weren't

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.270
enough advertisers.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.690
They also tried to offer a premium

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.410
service, Meetup Plus, which also

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.650
didn't work.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.770
So they had a lot of attraction,

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.990
but they couldn't make

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.610
money.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.830
This is true of many platforms.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.250
And they also had another problem, and

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.450
it is that as they didn't charge,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.030
a lot of people organized the events,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.370
proposed Meetups, but it didn't

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.970
matter, did it without any rigor, then

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.490
that event was failed, etc., and

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.970
in the end the interactions were

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.130
of very little quality.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.570
And they had a statistic that

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.110
only 2% of those Meetups were

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.510
finally successful, etc.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.210
Then they had to make a risky

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.590
decision, and what they started

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.090
to do was pay off.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.190
How to cover?

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.610
So pay people who decide

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.870
to go up a meeting.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.750
With this they get, that those

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.610
who go up a Meetup take it much

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.150
more seriously, then they

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.250
got the percentage of interactions

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.430
good, that is, the quality

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.230
increased a lot.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.650
This has had a very negative

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.830
impact on the...

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.370
In terms of activity,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.170
the amount of activity.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.210
It actually fell, it disappeared 95%.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.530
It has decreased a lot.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.210
But they found themselves in balance,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.870
because they managed to continue

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.490
generating Network Effects, although

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.310
it was with fewer users, they

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.970
boosted the quality

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.070
of the interactions.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.030
And, in addition, they obviously gave

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.410
a response to the challenge of

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.250
how to monetize all that enormous value generated.
