WEBVTT

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.940
Finally, we will analyze

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.500
the impact of rotation

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.640
on profitability.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.260
It is very important that we understand

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.260
this, I think it will help us understand

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.600
many things.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.900
Now, let’s go to the formula.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.140
Remember that ROA, which is the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.980
return on the asset, on the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.080
total investment made,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.780
regardless of how we have funded

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.900
ourselves, is equal to the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.540
net profit divided between

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.800
the asset.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.460
This is how much we have gained

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.760
from the investment we have made.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.460
Well, the ROA depends

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.640
mainly on two leverages.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.460
It depends on the margin and depends on the rotation.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680
It is the same as the rotation.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.560
That is, it is equal to the profit

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.740
we get from each of the monetary

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.880
units we have sold, how

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.540
much it becomes a profit,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.260
and we multiply it by the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.180
sales we are able to generate

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240
from that asset, from that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.500
investment.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.780
This is very well seen when in the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.660
formula what we do is to eliminate

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.160
the effect on the numberer and on

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.320
the denominator of sales, because

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.900
we are directly left with the ROA

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.520
formula, which is profit divided between

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
the total asset.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.200
What we’re going to do is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.820
look at two very different

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.900
in terms of rotation.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.520
They are two retail.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.560
What happens is that one has a very

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.480
low turnover of assets, like a jewelry

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.900
store.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.420
That is, it takes a long time from the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.820
time a jewel enters the store until

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.260
it is sold, from the time that these

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.540
inventories are purchased until they

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.220
are sold.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.520
And we will compare it to a model

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.260
with a very high rotation, because

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.440
they are perishable products

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.460
like a fruit store.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.220
And what we’re going to do is analyze

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.700
the numbers in detail from a series

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.580
of assumptions.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.460
Here is a table I created

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.660
with the numbers of the two.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.860
In both cases, the markup is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.360
three, i.e. they multiply by

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.840
three the purchase price of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.880
the jewelry or fruit and there

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.640
you have the sale price to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.260
the public.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.000
In the case of sales, it is a supposition.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.240
Let’s think this jewelry sells

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.220
a million dollars and the fruit

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.800
shop sells 200,000.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.440
However, the size does not affect

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.840
profitability in this case.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.020
That is, there may be jewelry stores

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.300
that sell a lot more and many actually

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.140
sell a lot more and the fruit stores

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.480
will usually have a smaller business

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
volume, but it is not the matter

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.300
now, because it will give

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.220
the same for the calculation

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.360
of profitability.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.860
The net margin in both cases is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.900
50%.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.960
This is not disqualified.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.200
That is, at the end of all

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.960
sales the net profit that is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.560
generated is 50% on sales,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.080
right?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.020
So we already have the net

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.760
profit that in one case is half a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040
million dollars and in another case

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.240
is 100,000 dollars.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440
But here comes the differences.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.580
Let’s think about the rotation.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.240
The rotation of a jewelry.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.360
How many days or how long does it take

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.500
from the time a jewel enters until it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.460
is sold on average?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.320
Let us consider that three months.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.380
It can be high or low depending

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.720
on a lot of things.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.980
But it is a supposition.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.880
And in the case of the fruit shop, we

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.600
will exaggerate it, because it is not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
really that high the rotation,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.660
but we will consider that all the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.920
goods that come into rotation every day.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.480
In other words, they buy the fruit and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.300
the asset.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.820
Let us consider here the total

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.980
asset, although we actually

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.520
did so only with stocks.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.420
In the case of jewelry, it is four.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.980
In the course of the year,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.760
the asset is sold four

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.540
times.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.820
The total of the asset per four

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.460
is equal to sales.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.160
In the case of fruit is the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
rotation is 365 days.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.920
Every day, we buy

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.620
and sell all the fruit.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.080


00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.080
And what we have done from here

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.240
is to calculate the asset.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.520
Calculate the investment we have

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.700
to make for a jewelry store that

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.700
sells a million dollars a year.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.660
The rotation is four times

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.540
a year.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.180
Over the course of the year, the assets

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.020
turn into sales four times.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.500
What investment should

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.880
we make?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.040
What is the average asset we

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.620
have to have in the jewelry?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.160
of 250,000 dollars.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.720
A considerable amount.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.200
In the case of the fruit industry,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.240
what is the investment we need to make?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.580
Look, it’s just the fruit you have

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.680
to buy every day, because

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.820
you sell it every day.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.740
The asset is $550.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.560
The difference here is already huge.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.340
Therefore, the ROA, be careful, the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.740
ROA is the net profit between the total

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.080
of the asset.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.120
The roof of the jewelry is two.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.240
The ROA of the fruit store is 182.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.520
It is true that here in this case

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.420
you say, no, it is that the

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.220
jewellery gets a very small fruitry

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.040
of $100,000.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.320
What would you prefer to have?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.760
A jewelry or five fruits?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.440
The answer is very simple.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.620
I would prefer to have five jewellery

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.760
shops because the return I’m going

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.880
to get on my investment is

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.900
infinitely higher.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.630
Why is?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.070
This is because the rotation of the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.210
asset is much larger.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.370
I think that from here we can already

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.670
understand what the enormous implication

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.270
that the rotation of the asset has

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.210
in the profitability and investment

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.890
that is made.
