00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.020
To make you understand the differentiation

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.640
strategy well, what we're going to

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.820
do, let's look at a series of examples

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.860
of companies that have managed to differentiate

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.560
themselves from the rest.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.300
We will also associate it with the

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.960
key differentiator factor.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.720
There are a number of common

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.140
factors that are usually differentiation,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.160
which often contribute

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.380
to differentiation.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.860
For example the brand.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.880
There are companies like Nike,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.040
which have managed to create

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.600
a world-renowned brand, what is

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.860
called a Love Brand, which

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.340
allows customers to pay for

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.340
that brand, pay more.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.440
I will give you two things that I love.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
One is this brand of gominolas that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.500
is called Omombo, the only thing I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
don't like is the name because it's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200
very hard to pronounce.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.980
And a brand of meat, mainly

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.260
hamburgers, which is called

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.220
Raza Nostra.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.360
Well, in both cases, the strategy

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.640
they have followed seems very bright,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.900
because they compete in very

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.180
indifferent markets, such as

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.180
the gominolas or the raw material

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.100
of a hamburger.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.300
However, in both cases they have

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.440
learned to apply a brand and this

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.620
has allowed them, because, in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.560
addition to selling much more expensive,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440
even to integrate forward and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.800
have their own distribution

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.760
channel, their own restaurant,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.260
their own stores, etc.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980
I think it's really brilliant and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.820
it's, as I told you, assigning

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.320
or applying a brand to sell a product

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.720
that's totally indifferent.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.160
The rest of Raza Nostra's competitors

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.700
do not have a brand and the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.600
consumer, therefore, is not willing

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.880
to pay that plus for that brand.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.900
Even in restaurants, in some

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.320
cases, in the menu you are

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.700
told that the hamburgers are

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.600
made by them.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.820
So, look at what they have achieved.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.920
Well, another of the, say, of the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.360
leverage to differentiate, one of

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.560
the most basic is to have a unique

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200
product, to be able to create a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.380
product of very high quality.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.460
For example, as Tesla has done, which

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.640
has known how to differentiate

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.680
absolutely in one sector, fix

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.060
yourself in a sector with large players,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.240
such as the Mercedes Benz groups,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.460
the German Audi, etc.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.520
And in the same sector we have an

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.400
example of how to differentiate

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.460
by focusing on one of the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.700
factors, in this case on security,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.240
one of the values.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.960
Volvo has sold millions of cars

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280
throughout its history, relying

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.200
on that, positioning itself as

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.000
the leading brand, the safest brand.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.220
As you can see, it's not about being

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.540
better in everything, it's about

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.900
identifying something that makes

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.220
you different from others.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.260
And I will analyze our case, the case

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.500
of The Power MBA.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.000
Our proposal is an absolutely differentiated

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.300
proposal for a number of reasons, but

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.440
in this case what I am going to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.540
talk about is to incorporate the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.660
testimonies and cases and the analysis

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.980
of success cases of entrepreneurs

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.240
who have made very big successes,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.560
for example, such as the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.540
case that you have on the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.100
red reveras screen.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.960
It is something differential, it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.140
is a differential proposal that the rest

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.380
of the programs cannot offer.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.520
You can also differentiate yourself

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.800
by means, for example, of customer

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.060
service, of after-sales service, for

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.600
example.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.460
In this case, this was a slogan of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.660
the Corte Inglés, if you are not

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.100
satisfied we will return your money.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.340
The Corte Inglés managed to differentiate,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.440
it managed to position itself

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.840
thanks to, among other things,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.780
the after-sales service.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.420
Another company that has used a clearly

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.740
successful case of how to use

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.220
the after-sales service to differentiate

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.940
you absolutely from your competitors

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.400
and to get better

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400
results is Zappos.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.200
Zappos is an e-commerce shoe that

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740
Amazon bought for 1.6 Billion,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.380
I think.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.920
I would like to give you an example

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.640
because it is a really spectacular case.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.220
Well, because the call center,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.400
the customer service of Zappos,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.260
the people who work in the call

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.520
center charge you much more than

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.940
you charge in the market

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.140
in similar positions.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.160
They have much more freedom.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.140
And I put you as an example that is

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.040
given in cases that if you do not

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.440
find the shoes you are looking

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.580
for in Zappos because you do not

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.620
have, for example, the detail, help

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.120
you find, the call center helps

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.800
you find those shoes on competition

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.680
websites.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.540
Well, in the end, with such cases, what

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.420
they have achieved is that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.280
customer retention is the largest in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.960
the market.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.860
As you can see, it's an example

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.080
of differences, in this case, through

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.440
a spectacular after-sales

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.400
service, right?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.400
Other differentiating factors,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.940
as you can rely on the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.200
customer experience.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.660
The customer experience is better

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.020
than the competition.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.260
I will put the case of Cabify, for example.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.140
The Cabify user experience

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.500
compared to a traditional

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.440
taxi is better.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.840
I think that's the competitive

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.820
advantage or differentiation of Cabify.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.820
Starbucks is a company that

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.160
grew also mainly for that, for

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.300
the customer experience at the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.460
point of sale.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.640
Another factor is convenience.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.980
And I put you, there are convenience

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.760
stores, for example, like 7-Eleven,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.200
which differs from the supermarket

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.400
or the large traditional

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.460
distribution is above all

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.980
convenience, proximity and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.000
schedule.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.840
These are competitive advantage

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.980
factors that contribute to a competitive

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.900
advantage.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.520
There will be customers who prefer

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.560
to buy in supermarkets, but what is

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.380
clear is that there is a segment

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.600
of customers who value this particularity,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.460
this differentiation

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.540
that is convenience,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.840
and opt for 7-Eleven.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.540
Another factor that contributes to

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.880
the competitive advantage is to have

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.560
the best talent.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.020
Garcia Parames is the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.320
most reputable fund

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.520
manager in Spain.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.380
And the fact of having Garcia Parames

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.740
is clear that it is an absolute

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.180
differentiation.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.600
And the manager who has the best,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.440
because obviously is differentiating

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.480
from the rest.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.180
And customers will usually

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.280
choose it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.340
You can be very creative, really,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.380
looking for differentiation,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.860
looking for competitive

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700
advantage.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.400
In this case I share on screen Machu,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.420
a collection of Machu, which is

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.480
one of the Bintae Group cellars

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.440
you already know.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.460
Well, since they are creating

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.700
this collection, with a story, with

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.020
a very curious storytelling, which

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.980
is three bottles, young, middle-

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.320
aged, and the old, which are based

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.820
on the aging of the wine, which

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.340
is really brilliant.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.060
Well, you already have something to tell.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.320
You have a different storytelling

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.260
than the rest of millions of

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.460
cellars that basically address their

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.900
customers and their channels with

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.700
a very indifferent proposal.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.260
As I said, I think this is an

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.300
example of the huge creativity

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.960
in this area.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.120
The possibilities for

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.080
differentiation are huge, but you

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.340
always have to look for that.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.800
You have to look for a factor or a variable

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.600
in which you are better than the others

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.600
and that allows you to differentiate

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.740
yourself from the rest.
