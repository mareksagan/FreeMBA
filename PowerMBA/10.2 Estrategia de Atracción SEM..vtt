00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.440
Sirvain, it is convenient to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.160
have a mix of channels or tools

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.460
that contribute to our

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.140
traffic generation goals.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.780
The more diversified it is better,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340
by pure common sense, as you told

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.040
us, then what I would like is

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.460
that we analyzed SEM and put it a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.860
little in context or that we highlighted

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
the pros and accounts or the benefits

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.520
and disadvantages of SEM

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.400
in general with respect to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.780
the rest of channels.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.300
Well, the first very positive point

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
is that we are responding to a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.640
very specific search, so when a

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.560
traffic is generated from the search,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.100
this traffic has a lot of charity

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.060
and conversion ratios are

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.720
usually quite high, of

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.540
the highest there are.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.740
That is the first point.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.440
This is from, if we think it is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.380
common sense because when I click

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.880
on an ad that has seemed to me

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.280
doing a search is what is called

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.800
very qualified, it is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.940
the click because I am looking

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520
for something related to what

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.560
that company offers.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.880
It is exactly this.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.660
This charity is valued.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.680
I have to respond correctly to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.560
this search.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.760
This is the first fundamental point.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.880
The problem, to contrast a little

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.300
this, is that I don't generate

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.620
demand, that is, that I depend on

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.280
external factors, since I'm not

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.920
able to motivate people to look

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.820
for more.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.900
It depends on many other factors.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.680
If you have a product or service

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.520
that people don't want, it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.680
makes no sense.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.380
Of course, I am thinking, for example,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.980
about very innovative companies

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.540
that are generating new solutions,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.660
that are generating new demand,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.260
that no one is looking for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.540
concepts that they do not know

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.200
exist.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.460
Actually, that is exactly the problem.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.900
That is a limitation.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.060
At the end of the day, searches

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.600
are still very large and there is

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.000
much to do, but clearly it is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.820
one of the limits.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.040
Points very in favor too.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.680
There is no minimum investment.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.920
I can't give you so many clicks

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.240
for my two euros.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.600
There are companies that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.220
invent a lot more money, but that'

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.820
s a business model issue.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.180
It is easy and fast, quite

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.060
quickly.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.760
I can start a campaign, measure

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.100
the first results and then

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.940
start optimization.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.140
I would say that it is probably the easiest.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.520
Because if we think, for example,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.120
let's think of Facebook Ads, we

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.380
put a lot of the example.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.000
Facebook Ads is easy, but

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.160
you need creativity.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.960
actually is.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.440
It is easy to do it, but you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.800
need it.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.640
In ten minutes I won't have them.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.660
actually is.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.920
It is very easy,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.220
but it can also be very sophisticated.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.160
That is, to start running,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.680
yes, it is very easy, but then

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.140
there is a world of methodologies

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.300
and ways to make the best

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.180
use of the Google AdWords and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.340
Bing Ads platform, which are worth

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.000
knowing too.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.080
It is very easy to do it.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.800
Doing it right is very difficult, but well,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.560
that's already understood.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.280
As always.
