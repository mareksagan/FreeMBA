WEBVTT

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's see how to move from

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.500
segmentation variables to

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.080
customer people in The Power MBA.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.480
I will give you an example.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.640
Let's start with the segmentation variables.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.880
How can we segment some of the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.420
variables?

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.680
Because of the age, the

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.440
geography, the situation.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.600
This is very important here and it

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.140
is the first one we used.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.380
Well, we have, there are clients The

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.960
Power MBA, The Power Digital Marketing,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.560
I give no difference any program.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.740
There are clients who work for another,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200
others are undertaking, others

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.320
are entrepreneurs, already

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.340
live from their business.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.920
We can segment by studies, depending

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.220
on whether they have studies

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.820
related to business or not.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.200
And we could also segment more,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.800
as lawyers, engineers, etc.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.540
We could get a thousand segments.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.920
A very valuable variable that we

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.540
used here and came to us well is

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.040
based on the benefit they seek,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.860
the goal.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.900
And these are some.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840
There are people who want to update.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.660
There are people who have a job that doesn't

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.760
make them happy at all and want to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.700
undertake one day.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.700
There are people who really want

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.240
the MBA concept as far as 360-point

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.540
business vision is concerned.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.320
There are people who already have a business

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.220
and have the pain that it doesn't grow

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.680
enough or that they are aware

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.660
that they don't take advantage of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.580
the opportunities and want

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.820
to grow it.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.320
There are people who want

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600
to find a better job.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.300
Another segmentation variable, for example,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.160
is that you are looking for a master

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.640
or not looking for a master.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.160
Well, all this, and there are more, and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.080
could detail them a lot more, all

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.820
this gives you a lot of information.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.920
Imagine, of course, that you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.040
already know a lot more about

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380
how to address them, how to capture

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.640
them, etc., how to convince

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.300
them, etc., etc.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.360
Now we go to customer people,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.640
which is evolution.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.000
And how do we do it?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.860
As I said, there are two ways.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.500
We can cross all those

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840
variables, considering them

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.160
all to try to identify a number

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.400
of customer people.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.880
Or what we can do is think about

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.740
customers, real customers, rather

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.060
than deductively, analytically,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.200
think about real customers and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.140
then analyze them with

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.960
those variables and understand

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.040
them better and better.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.780
I recommend you use both.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.360
Then, we at The Power MBA, what

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.960
we have done from the knowledge

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.420
we have been acquiring, etc.,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.180
the conversations and so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.060
on, because we have identified

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.360
several customer people that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.860
these segmentation variables

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.960
help us to understand them.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.300
I'll put a few, right?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.400
The Dreamer.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.740
What defines dreamer?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.740
How can we describe dreamer?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.060
To be representative of all

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.460
dreamer within The Power MBA or

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.000
The Power Digital Marketing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.100
or The Power eCommerce or whatever.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.460


00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.740
What really defines them?

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.640
Well, they are people who are not entirely

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.160
happy in their work, in what they do,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.060
in their work, in their company,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.300
whatever it is, and who would love

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.320
to mount something.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.500
They don't know how, they are

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.800
afraid, and so on.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.340
I could describe this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.180
in detail, right?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.280
I will be a little bit on the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.580
creams, with the main idea.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.760
This is a very important customer

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.640
person in this case, who were

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.860
our early adopters.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.760
And that if, look, remember that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.840
I told you people usually do it bad.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.920
If we can describe ourselves

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.320
here that the customer person

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.500
and we say because I was 28 years

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.460
old, worked in a company related

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.980
to automotive, had studied

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.600
marketing and so on.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.440
Of the dreamers that are

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.360
in The Power MBA, many

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.800
don't agree with that.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Do you understand why I tell you people

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.060
often do it badly?

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.840
What they agree with is other things.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.920
What they agree with is that they are

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.060
not entirely happy with their work,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.720
that they would like to mount something,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.100
that they don't know how to do that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.920
kind of thing.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.140
I like Disney, things.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.400
That is what they agree with.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.780
And then in the other segmentation

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.520
variables such as age, profession,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.640
etc., because there are very diverse,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.760
right?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.420
But the important thing is not that in

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.700
this case.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.980
The most important thing is the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.960
bread you have.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.280
So if we understand the dreamer

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.600
well, that we understand them

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.040
well, what they think of us, whether

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.460
they are looking for something

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.700
or not looking for something, etc.,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.840
as we understand very well, because

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.880
we sell them very well.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.260
More customer people?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.520
We call them technicians,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.460
who are mainly engineers.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.160
But there are architects, lawyers, there

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.180
are all sorts, right?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.320
What they want is to grow

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.640
professionally.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.380
They are not the dreamer.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.200
But what happens is that they

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.000
are aware that they need to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.940
expand their business knowledge.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.380
All their lives engineers have done,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140
when they want to get up,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.280
they have done an MBA.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.120
Well, then that is that.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.660
And he is a customer person who when

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.820
you describe it like this, you understand

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.960
it like that, and you know Jorge and analyze

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.120
Jorge, you understand them very well

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.560
and it is very easy to sell them.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.560
But be sure there will be engineers,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.120
if we get to segment, there will be

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.180
engineers who are not, who are

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.920
not here, who are not technical,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.060
who are not technical for

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.100
us, who are dreamer, because

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200
what they dream is like mounting

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.720
a company.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.200
So, as you can see, the demographic

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.480
variable of whether you are an engineer

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.460
or not an engineer, well, because

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.580
you have to put it in the equation,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.780
but the most important thing is

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.340
not that.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.280
The most important thing is not the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.380
demographic variable of whether you are

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.460
an engineer or not an engineer.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.240
The most important thing is that in this

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.740
case, whether you are an engineer, lawyer

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.480
or whatever, but that in addition to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.240
your pain, you have studied a technical

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.220
career, you have a very good

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.720
training, but you want to have that

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.980
360-point vision of the business, as

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.960
you have wanted to have engineers

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.200
all your life when they go to

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.800
an MBA.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.040
I will explain another.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.680
A new customer person.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.880
In this case, she is a professional

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.060
who has been working for a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.700
few years, with a good job,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.500
etc., and who also likes what

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.640
she does, is an avid of what

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.480
she does, etc.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.840
You may dream of starting, but in

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.160
the bottom you know it's a dream,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.440
but what moves you is that you

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.300
like to be up to date.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.440
He doesn't like to feel that there

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.200
are things around related to

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480
his work directly or not so directly

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.840
that he doesn't know, that he doesn't

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.340
know the business, that he's

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.980
getting out.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.280
You don't like to know that a program

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.780
like The Power MBA or The Power Digital

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.920
Marketing has been born and that you're

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.620
looking elsewhere, because you're

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.640
missing out on opportunities.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.560
That is his bread.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.880
In this case, we have made

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.140
a demographic segmentation as to

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.420
age, because we have said that

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.280
it is usually people who have

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.520
been working for a few years, but

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.960
some do not, right?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.860
But as you can see, what we are

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.440
doing is to analyze them from

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.460
different perspectives,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.960
demographic, pain, what they

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.560
are looking for in us, etc.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.620
And we have been able to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.260
identify a number of customer people

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.060
who are really representative

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.760
of all our customers and help

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.880
us to understand them

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.340
very well and to sell them very

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.520
well and to communicate with

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.740
them because we know what they

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.680
feel, what they think, what

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.440
they expect.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.360
But when we tried to make the complete

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.260
files and such, we described Anna

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.720
and described her in things

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880
because they were not the important

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.720
ones.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.960
And as it was Ana, Jorge, Kike, Javier,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.740
Laura, whatever, and as they were

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.900
not important, then it is difficult

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.380
for us to extrapolate it.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.040
I will return to the example of Kiki.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.020
Kike was 28 and he was a

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.880
dreamer, but it's that

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.940
we're meeting dreamer who are

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.980
28, who are 21, who are 46,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.960
who have studied business

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.320
or have not studied business.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.840
But what unites them is not that.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.420
What unites them, in this case, is

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.740
what I told you, that they are not entirely

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.620
happy, that they dream of undertaking

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620
but do not know how to

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.520
do it, etc.
