00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.010
Platforms are revolutionizing

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.270
the world.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.630
This phrase may be repeated

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.970
several times throughout the

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.610
course of platform

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.910
strategy, but it is the truth

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.410
and we can’t look elsewhere.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.810


00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.010
And the cause of this is that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.450
companies whose business model

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.450
is a platform benefit from

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.410
the possibility of growing

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.350
much more scalable, usually

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.170
of higher returns and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.590
usually generate entrance

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.570
barriers that almost turn

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.190
them into true monopolies.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.450
And look, I’ll give you some

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.530
data to illustrate what I’m saying.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.630
I will name five companies.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.470
Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.650
Do you know them all?

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.670
Well, they are the five companies with

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.170
the largest stock market capitalization

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.550
in the world and it is no coincidence

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.970
that all of them, much of their

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.490
business model, is a platform.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.290
But when we talk about platforms,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.010
we don’t just think of the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.550
big social networks or the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.730
robberies that come from

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.650
Silicon Valley, etc.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.390
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.550
It is that they are revolutionizing all

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.550
sectors at the global level, but also

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.350
at the local level.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.410
And we talk about sectors such

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.930
as hairdressers, gyms, home

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.710
cleaning, software,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.770
energy, transportation,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.410
any sector.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.810
It is also not coincidental

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.970
that simply in the environment of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.430
the founders of The Power NBA

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.250
we can talk about brutal success

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.870
cases like 20 sold to Telefónica

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.930
for 80 million.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.230
The red refrigerator sold to Rocket

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.030
Internet for 80 million as well.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.750
Ticket Peace sold for $140 million

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.630
Couponation is a company that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.330
in 5 years has gone

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.830
from trading $0 to $500 million

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.750
annually.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.390
Jovan Talent is trading

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.710
around 6 million a month

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.630
and with an exponential

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.930
growth.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.910
O Cavify, I don’t even want you to tell

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.990
the volume of business you have.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.830
As I said, this is not

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.590
coincidence.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.850
All this is due to the fact

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.470
that platforms benefit from

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.710
many advantages over linear

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.990
and traditional models.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.490
And in fact almost all success cases

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.970
would tell you that 90% of success

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.070
cases if we look around

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.410
in the entrepreneurial world,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.690
etc., are platforms.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.270
There is one very important thing and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.030
one must take into account and is that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.610
this is not just about understanding

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.990
what a platform is and what are the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.270
differences with a linear model.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.630
We have to go a little further because

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.630
all the literature or all the knowledge

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.310
that has been generated throughout

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.630
history as far as management,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.550
management of companies, etc., has

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.390
been born in an environment that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.450
was different from the current,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.950
in an environment in which companies

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.870
were what we call linear

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.990
companies.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.870
However, the platforms, the platforms’

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.090
breakthrough is relatively

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.210
recent and there is not much,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.310
let’s say a lot of

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.350
knowledge about it.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.330
And less in traditional business

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.070
schools that are not often updated.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.630
And what I want to go is that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.710
the management of a platform

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.210
in terms of topics such as value

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.690
delivery, competitive advantage,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.610
growth strategy, etc., has

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.930
to be radically different

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.150
from the management of a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.670
linear model because it has many

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.110
implications in the business

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.650
model, in the strategy.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.610
All that we will see because I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.510
think it is important and we have

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.190
also seen a lot of people who

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.810
have opted for a model like marketplace,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.330
social network, etc., without

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.350
really being aware of the implications

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.790
that management has and has

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.690
committed the usual mistakes

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.130
of managing it with

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.110
the same criteria that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.230
if it were a linear model,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.990
is it?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.150
So what will we learn?

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.670
You will understand very well what

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.190
a platform is and what the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.690
differences are with linear models.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.890
Let’s see what are the types of platforms

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.870
because maybe you come to the head

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.050
the marketplace or the social networks

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.290
Airbnb or a social network like

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.370
Facebook, but it’s that it’

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.310
s a very wide world.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.310
There are many types.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.250
We have on-demand platforms like

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.950
Cavify, for example.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.530
There are content-centric networks

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.350
such as TripAdvisor,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.210
Yelp or YouTube.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.410
Well, we will see it.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.290
It is very important that you understand

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.370
the concept of network effect

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.690
or network effect or network

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.750
economy that is the main difference

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.530
between platforms and linear

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.390
models.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.890
We will identify the benefits,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.630
all the benefits of the platforms

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.510
and what are the causes and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.430
finally what we will do is

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.790
give advice about how for any

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.690
manager who faces the challenge

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.410
of making a radical difference

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.350
to a linear business.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.030
Basically the platform is that you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.570
have two customer segments, you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.430
have two sides, it’s harder.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.690
If you do, your company

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.030
will be worth a lot more.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.870
And like in all the courses in The

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.910
Power MBA we are lucky that we will

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.610
be able to share with you and first-

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.230
hand the analysis of cases

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.570
like the red fridge, like Jovan

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.810
Talent, as of the super, which

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.290
is a case of how to convert,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.270
how to evolve from an online

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.530
supermarket, which is a traditional

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.550
linear model, to a platform

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.750
that connects supermarkets

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.690
with buyers.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.050
It’s a very interesting case and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.810
finally we’ll analyze Samplia,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.790
which I think you’ll love too.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.510
It’s a very original idea and another

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570
example of how to turn a traditional

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.410
company into a platform,

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.590
not just a platform,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.030
but a super-profitable business

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.570
model, with huge entry

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.050
bars and that will grow

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.590
a lot in the coming years.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.450
Well, to finish, I want

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.490
to convey that we have done a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.650
huge effort in this course.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.710
I think it is an excellent course, it

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.390
is a short course, but it will help

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.410
you understand a lot of things and

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.090
it is also that it is not easy to have

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.830
been able to analyze so many

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.710
close success cases, it will be

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.730
the particularity that in our environment

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.290
we have been able to analyze

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.470
in great detail almost the companies,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.310
the platforms that have had

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.090
the most in recent years.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.670
I hope you enjoy it, learn

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.970
a lot and get a lot of

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.790
experience.
