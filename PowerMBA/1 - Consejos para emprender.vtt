WEBVTT

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.800
Thanks to my professional career

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.700
and especially now at The Power

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.560
of Media, the truth is I'm lucky

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.880
to meet almost every successful

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.500
entrepreneur every day.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.960
Well, not only success, but we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.760
have also analyzed a lot of failure

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.740
cases and what I'm going to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
share with you is a summary of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320
some of the most common tips

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.740
we've identified most common

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.240
in successful entrepreneurs.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.600


00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.200
In fact, they will be 11.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.100
And in many cases, it's advice you'

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.320
re going to say, well, it's pure

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.920
common sense.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.800
They are common sense, but the reality

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200
is that very few people take them

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.080
into account.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.240
And not taking them into account in many

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.600
cases leads you to failure.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.100
We start.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.500
The first is to disappoint your idea.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240
And why do we say this?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.140
This is very common for entrepreneurs

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.480
who fall in love with their business.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.720


00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.520
One day an idea comes to their heads,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.720
they get crazy, they think they have

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.940
got the Coca-Cola formula and

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.200
that that idea is unique in the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.700
world and will make them millionaries.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.200
And it also seems that many times

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.800
it is very funny, but they don'

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.140
t want to tell anyone, they want

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.760
to develop the project almost hidden.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.840
You have probably known such cases.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.900
Well, because the reality, pure

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.800
statistics, is that your project

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.520
probably fails and your idea

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.700
probably isn't as wonderful

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.540
as you think.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.300
That is the reality.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000
If you have an idea and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.400
one day you wonder

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.900
your idea, remember this.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.640
Remember, this may not be as

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.200
fat as I thought.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.580
All projects have

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.840
to start with a vision.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.020
This idea is born of your idea.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.380
Vision is where you want to get.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.160
Do you want to change the world?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.740
Do you want to revolutionize a business?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.220
I don't know, whatever it is.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.320
The vision is the anchor, it must guide you.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.580
What happens is that what you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.360
have to be flexible is on the way.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.420
How will you come to that vision?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.820
You have to be flexible.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.920
You have to be able to listen to other

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.640
people and above all what you have

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.800
to be very able to understand

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.080
what the market says to you.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.260
Always with your vision in mind,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.880
but with the flexibility

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.420
enough to know how to go

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.120
pivoting, looking at the path that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.520
will lead you to that vision.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.960
The first is Lean

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.360
Startup.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.280
Lean Startup is a methodology that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.300
will help you a lot and you will

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.440
learn it in The Power MBA.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.280
And I can tell you, we will see it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.080
in more detail, but that there

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.860
are very many cases of failure,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.100
in some cases of very prepared

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.380
people and that have been invested

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.700
and wasted millions of euros,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.180
which could have been solved in

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.840
a very simple way simply having

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.300
applied the principles of Lean

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.380
Startup.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440
And I know people even,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.020
serial entrepreneurs, now successful,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.240
who all their previous projects,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.760
which count as an anecdote

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.340
that the day they read the book,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.800
realized that all the projects

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.160
and all the money they

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.940
had thrown up to date

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.080
could have saved them.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440
No. 3: Don't wait for a business

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.200
angel.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.840
We have used the term Business

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.340
Angel, but well, what I mean here

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.160
is that if you have an idea,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.180
if you want to learn, do

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.400
not do something that is very common

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.840
in entrepreneurs and is to wait

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.120
for someone to help them or

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.540
someone to solve the paper,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.300
no.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.840
And you should not block your decision

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.320
or condition it to come a Business

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.380
Angel and fund your project

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.880
when you have not yet demonstrated

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.960
anything, or to get the typical

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.920
award with coaching in a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.980
trade chamber or incubator,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.000
etc., no.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.060
If you really want to do so, if

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.460
you trust your project and believe

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.780
you have the necessary knowledge

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.880
and competences, what you have

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.320
to do is start yourself.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.280
And then we will see it in more detail,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.880
but usually the recommended thing is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.220
that you start with your resources or

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.660
with the resources of very close people.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.780
Don't block the decision waiting for

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.080
someone to fix it for you.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.720
Tip number four, don't get

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.260
mad with technical development.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.580
What do I mean with this?

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.500
And it is something very usual.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.000
If you are an entrepreneur, you are

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.020
sure to be identified.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.780
Especially entrepreneurs whose

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.580
proposals require or are balanced

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.780
on a website, on a platform,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.340
in an application, etc.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.380
The usual thing is that, especially

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.560
entrepreneurs who are not experts

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.000
in the technical area, they find

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.280
a world of creating the website

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.160
and creating the platform.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.860
And from the beginning what they

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.940
do is look for a supplier and put

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.600
themselves in the hands of an agency

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.960
or a programmer, etc., which seems

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.160
to become the most important person

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.080
in the company during the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.820
first months.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.680
And all the effort, all the focus

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.060
and all the budget goes there

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.940
to create the website.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.160
It is ridiculous, I tell you, it is

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.240
ridiculous, don't do it.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400
What you have to do at first

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.660
is, the most important thing is to validate

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.840
that that you are building, there

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.820
is someone who wants to buy it,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.740
someone sees value and in addition

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.380
that that feedback incorporates

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.040
it into the product development.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.500
And the least important thing is how

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.200
to give it a solution, really, because

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.160
that is a commodity.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.160
The important thing, what creates true

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.880
value is that you are able to identify

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.100
something or be able to create

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.380
something that people want to buy.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.420
The technical specifications

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.000
are much less important, don'

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.100
t focus on that, don'

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.960
t wear it off.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.780
We're going to get the fifth tip and

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.820
what we're going to start talking

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.780
about here is, they're tips related

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.620
to partners, the team, etc.,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.960
with whom to surround you.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.400
The first is to find a partner.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.940


00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.760
It is very hard to be an entrepreneur

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.480
if you are alone and if we think

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.880
of the main ones, we can think of

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.220
the main exits in recent years

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.340
in Spain, almost all, are at

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.420
least two or more co-founders.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.340
Why is?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.660
For several reasons, first because there

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.920
are many bad days in which having partners

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.240
helps you and also because it is very

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.920
difficult, except that you are superman,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.280
that you have all the abilities,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.720
all the competencies, that you

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.060
are a leader, good communicator,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.420
visionary, you understand the

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.700
business, you understand the networking,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.720
you understand the money, it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.780
is very complicated.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.740
Instead, it is much easier than

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.580
between two or three or four

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.980
people, maybe four is too

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.340
much, all those competences are combined.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.260
In addition, the choice of those

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.440
partners is very important and in

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.220
many cases the partners are chosen without

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.120
thinking.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.940
It seems to be done naturally.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.000
But you really have to make

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.920
this decision very reasonably.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.800
And one of the recommendations of the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.880
advice I have heard from many successful

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.280
entrepreneurs, that in addition if we

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.640
analyze them is so, it is that people

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.380
have been associated that complement

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.760
themselves.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.120
What do I mean by this?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.840
People who have different competencies,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.000
because one is more technical and

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.780
the other is more focused on business,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.260
one is more commercial and the

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.740
other is more executive,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.080
I don't know.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.760
But they come together, they generate

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.340
those synergies and it is also important,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.340
another factor that is important, and

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.160
is that each person likes to do different

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.680
things.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.940
Because there is one that likes

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.260
to manage teams more and the other

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.540
likes to sell and be in events,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.720
be in the saras, well.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.400
But this is important because I

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.200
have met cases of entrepreneurs

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.260
who were very similar in the

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.420
end, they understood each other

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.100
well but they were too

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.860
similar and both liked doing the

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.560
same thing.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.360
And they were not generating value,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.500
they were destroying value, there was

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.580
a duplicity.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.640
Another unromantic recommendation

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.560
is that things stay very clear and

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.080
written from the first day.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.420
I know you won't do this because

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.520
people of that and this advice.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.240
But think one thing, just think this,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.080
spend five minutes or less thinking

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.980
about cases close to you of entrepreneurs

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.220
or entrepreneurs who have discussed

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.440
with their partners, it's super

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.160
common.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.700
Why is?

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.800
Well, because things, first

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.700
because decisions were

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.240
made without thinking too much

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.580
and also not established in

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.080
writing.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.960
Relationships usually

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.360
last for many years,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.460
good times, bad times

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.200
and opportunities

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.240
to discuss are countless.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.900
Take it into account.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.440
Another recommendation is that, I said

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.840
before, you are looking for a partner, looking

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.020
for one or several partners, but what

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.180
is not that you are too founding partners.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.920
For example, the typical case of the

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.560
master's project.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.240
Among all of you who have

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.340
participated in the project say,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.640
well, let's build the company.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.520
This is a guaranteed failure

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.780
formula, for many reasons.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.800
Because within those 5 or

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.240
6 people, 7 who they are,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
there are probably many conflicts

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.460
of interest.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.500
Some are willing to work more,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.600
some want to roll a lot

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.020
in the project and others

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.920
want to have it like an accessory.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.300


00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.200
For example, some want to work

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.460
hard and others expect something

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:51.880
else.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.420
Well, the point is not to associate,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.100
not to be too partners

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.880
and so on.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.100
There is another reason and you

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.280
will understand it later and is that

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.500
if within the founders team each

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.600
of the founders is already

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.560
too diluted.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.500
That is, it has a small percentage

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.320
of the company.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.760
After that, when funding

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.920
rounds are made, investors

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.560
enter and founders are

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.360
diluted.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.620
In the end, what will happen is

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.000
that you will have such a small percentage

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.440
of the company that it won't

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.140
be worth it.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.220
You will lose motivation

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.800
and that doesn't like investors.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.500
I can tell you an anecdote.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.960
For example, we were not long

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.500
ago about to enter a very interesting

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.480
project with an innovative

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.280
technology that created

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.000
a lot of value, etc., even

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.880
patented, but that the team

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.120
of the founders was very

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.600
diluted.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.280
They were many founders.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.460
Because it was the project so

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.780
attractive that when they went to the

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.640
bank to ask for money the bank director

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.460
put money.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.680
When they went to the notary to sign

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.000
the writings, the notary put in money.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.340
Everyone was putting money.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.980
In conclusion, the founding partners,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.520
the company managers who were

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.700
mainly two and by the way one

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.140
is the one of Power MBA, already

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.140
had a minority percentage.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.060
So, of course, for investors

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.120
later that is very unattractive

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.300
because you are getting into a

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.180
company with too many partners

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.980
in which those who provide

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.880
value are already diluted.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.700
The risk of being discouraged is very

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.320
high because they perceive less

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.020
long-term benefit.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.040
Now let's get advice

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.040
about who to hire and how

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.120
to hire.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.580
There is a very common advice

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.640
that we have heard many times

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.780
in successful entrepreneurs is

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.440
to hire slowly and quit quickly.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.560
Why are you hiring slowly?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.600
This is something that is sometimes

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.720
very complicated in startups because

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.180
you have to keep in mind that startups

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.280
are companies that grow a lot

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.680
in the first few years.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.860
That you move from founding partners

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.500
to dozens of employees very quickly.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.800
Every day it seems like you need

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.480
a new person.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.900
There is a tendency

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.580
to hire too quickly.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.920
And really the recommendation

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920
is to be patient, to be patient

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.800
because in addition the

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.640
needs you have today of human

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.160
capital may change tomorrow.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.440
Therefore, it is risky

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.840
to hire every time a need

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.480
arises.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.000
And the second part of the

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.280
recommendations is hurried off.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.620
Sometimes it's hard, to say goodbye

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.580
is very hard, but you really have

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.660
to be inflexible about it when

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.960
you identify that there are people

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.580
inside your team that don't fit within

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.280
the culture or that don't share

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.980
values, etc.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.800
It is best to fired him as soon

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.620
as possible.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.660
Another recommendation is to look

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.180
for micro-entrepreneurs.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.240
And I will explain why.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.480
I don't know if you know the world

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.540
of startup, I don't know if you

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.360
know the culture or some organization

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.240
like that, but it's how the working

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.480
environment and culture in

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.800
a startup is very different from

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.400
traditional companies for many reasons.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.340
It is a much more dynamic environment,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.720
opportunities are much greater,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.560
companies that grow are those that

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.840
go well, they grow much more than

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.420
traditional companies

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.500
that are already in a mature

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.380
market, in principle the

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.100
growth is less.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.900
The challenge is bigger and the

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.880
opportunities are bigger.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.180
It is also true that in some cases

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.040
the companies when the working

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.420
conditions are born are not

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.020
so good.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.740
We look at it from an objective

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.060
or traditional perspective.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.620
And the risk is even greater.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.560
So you have to look for people

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.760
who are like the founders,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.700
who are microentrepreneurs.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.740
People who have a lot of

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.520
capacity, a lot of

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.340
productivity, a lot of initiative.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.780
You can't hire profiles that

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.960
are waiting for you to tell

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.480
you what to do.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.580
You have to hire profiles that arrive

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.720
in the morning at the office and that

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.300
are able to create value to the company

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.360
without anyone telling them

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.800
anything.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.720
They are micro-entrepreneurs.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.560
They also share their values.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.960
And finally, it's something that's very well-

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.920
known and that's very well known that it'

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.740
s the advice to surround yourself with people

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.860
better than you.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.600
But that's the reality and it's the

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.480
best you can do.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.940
You have to find people who are

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.400
great to be better than you.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.980
This is the only way you can

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.580
build a team that will support

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.300
you.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.520
The reality is that the first five

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.640
or six employees in your company

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.160
will determine the success of your

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:11.820
failure.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.420
So, they are looking for great people.
