00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.020
Carlos, I would love to tell

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.480
you what the Empaty Map

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.280
is, what this tool is, how it is

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.900
used and what it serves to.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.120
Well, in the process of deciding

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.080
which market we want to go to and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.340
once we have segmented and prioritized

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.960
it, the next step is to understand

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.360
how a person is, how is the

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.780
type representative of that

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.840
segment to which we want

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.640
to go.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.100
The Map of Empathy is a

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.580
tool that helps us to structure

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.660
how we think, what desires

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.720
we have, what we look for,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.200
what concerns that type of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.300
representative of our segment

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.820
to then act accordingly.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.340
That is.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.220
It is very practical when we don't

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.500
have a representative of the segment

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.740
to interview or even, even if we

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.980
don't have, to structure how

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.660
he thinks and what needs that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.780
person has.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.060
It would be much harder to understand

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.680
that customer person, that problem,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.080
starting from an eye in the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.540
blank.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.560
Yes, that, well, just like you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.660
explained to us with the Business

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.140
Model Campus, in the end they are

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.480
very simple tools, but what they help

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.880
you is to structure the analysis.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.680
actually is.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.400
This is your target customer and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.560
you have an eye in the eye, because

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.040
I don't know why.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.860
We need to look at all the aspects

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.880
that we need to consider.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.160
Not leaving anything, actually.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760
Well, we already know what it is for.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.840
And how it is.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.220
Well, as we see in the image, the Map

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.100
of Empathy is a canvas, it is a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.760
scheme in which in the center of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.980
the whole is the person, the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.460
representative of the segment

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.660
we are analyzing.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.820
It has a curious appearance and is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.620
that, if we see in the image, the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.880
upper part represents the person's

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.600
brain, the right part the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.940
eyes, the bottom the mouth and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.020
the left the ear.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.180
And precisely, on the basis of

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.480
this symbole, it is on what the four

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.460
main quadrants are structured.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.020
That monkey is not...

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.940
It is not aesthetic, it is not a mere

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.820
decorative matter, it has its

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.400
meaning.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.080
And you need to paint it so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.420
that it's more inspiring.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.800
In fact, as we see in the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.580
upper quadrant, we have what he thinks

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.580
and feels.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.260
How the customer has a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.700
need from expectations, generally

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.940
quite subjective.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.480
On the right side, associated with the eyes,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.600
we see what we see.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.580
Facts, objectives, what you see,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.620
what you can see in the day to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.800
day.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.740
Below, associated with the mouth, we have

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.240
what he says and does, what his attitude

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.040
is, how he expresses it, what his

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
conduct is.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.020
And on the left we have what

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.040
he hears, what he is constantly

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.340
hearing in his environment,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.240
in the press, in social

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.800
media, etc.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.380
And finally, below, two large

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.800
boxes also that will serve us to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.980
make a relationship of what is

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.200
what really concerns you both short

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.220
and medium-term and long term

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.880
and what needs has that representative

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.820
of our segment.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.880
That is, basically what we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.580
have to do is go asking

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.560
one by one each of those questions

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.340
thinking about our

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.460
target customer segment.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.740
That is, either thinking about

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.320
putting us in the head of that target

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.500
client or interviewing

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.580
a representative of the segment

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.260
based on this structure that

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380
facilitates us to put in order

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.560
what he himself possibly knows

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.160
but sometimes does not know how

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.540
to express.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.420
Before you go on, I'll ask you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.880
a question.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.220
Do we need to use the empathy

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.620
map for each of the customers

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.300
people?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.340
Of course, you need to make an empathy

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.580
map for each segment.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.020
Each representative of the segment

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.180
will have different opinions,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.540
desires, needs and concerns.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.840
In some cases, they may coincide or

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.200
not.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.320
But each segment, a map of empathy,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.260
a customer person and then a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.540
marketing mix and a concrete

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.380
value proposal that gives response

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260
to the concern we have detected

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.360
in the map of empathy.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.420
I like, as we see in the picture,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.640
always clarify in those four quadrants

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.740
that my experience tells

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.540
me that they are not always clear

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.600
or there are doubts about where I

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.340
put what.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.580
I over time and after having done many

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.020
exercises with the map of empathy

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.560
associate, as we see in the image,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.900
what he thinks and feels about opinions,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.780
desires, what he would really like,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.980
what there is subjectively in that

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.580
person that he would like in

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.460
the future, what he sees concrete

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.200
facts, objective facts

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.140
he is seeing in his day

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.480
to day.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.160
What do the employees usually

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.720
say and do?

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.880
In general, people when they talk

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.640
we talk to complain, very rarely people

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.280
talk to say beautiful things and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.220
they listen to opinions of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.200
third parties, mainly

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.480
opinions of third parties

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.060
and that therefore influence

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.620
their way of thinking and

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.260
behaving.
