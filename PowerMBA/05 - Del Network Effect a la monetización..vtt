00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160
Michael the first.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.720
I want to thank you for giving

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.460
us the opportunity.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.360
It is a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.280
It is a real luck to be here with you.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.080
Your trajectory is unique.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.460
You are a star in this.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960
You have a lot to tell and I think

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.440
it’s a lucky thing for Power

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.360
MBA students to learn from you,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.540
which is what it’s all about

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.920
after all.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.760
I would love to tell us how

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.040
your career as a serial entrepreneur

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.940
has been, with many success cases,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.860
and we will end up having

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.600
a series of tips or tips for

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.620
many of our students who dream

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.980
of a day to undertake,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.900
step forward, be brave

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.280
and succeed.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.100
and perfect.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.800
Thank you Borja and thank you for

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.320
your words.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.720
I don’t deserve it and I’m almost

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.760
going to put myself red.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.560
But I have been lucky to have

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.140
very good teams in all the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.200
projects that are the key to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.880
success and are the ones who

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.000
truly have the merit in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.740
everything we have done.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560
And effectively, as you say, I like

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280
to undertake and that’s why after

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.660
my first company I started in 2009

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.620
bringing the concept of coupons

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.400
to Spain when I created Les Bonus.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.960
And then we had a huge growth with

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.500
operations in six countries,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.000
600 people.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.980
We have gone from zero customers

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.880
in two years to over 20 million

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.960
newsletters customers worldwide.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.260
I often like to do it and it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.000
puts me in.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.620
And I would also recommend to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.860
all your students, which is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.960
a vital and unique personal and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.480
professional experience, how to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.900
do an MBA with you, in the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.540
sense that I put you an example.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.560
I worked in a multinational company,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.680
I was as a general manager in

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.400
a company.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.860
He was a company with a turnover of

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.540
200 million euros and a team of more

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.400
than 300 people in several countries.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.120
I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.900
I did not come from a business family

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.100
because my parents were civil servants.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.280
Therefore, you don’t have to have

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920
it in the genes, as someone says,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.060
it’s simply the need to pursue

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.020
your dream.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.840
It is clear, it is not my case.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.680
I had the need to create a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.920
project for me.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.860
I also studied, I did my MBA,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040
I worked several years in the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.920
corporate world, but instead

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.680
of spending my money on cars or

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.660
luxury, I saved money to set up

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.520
my own company.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.080
The jump is complex.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.880
He was over 30 years old and a child

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.360
on the way.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.080
I always compare it to the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.600
experience of a movie I like so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.900
much, which is the Matrix movie,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.520
in that scene that Morfeo

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.460
tells Neo.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.140
You have two paths.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.120
The blue pill, where you’ll work

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.960
for a large multinational,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.340
you’ll be on vacation,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.460
you’ll have support and innovation.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.320


00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.080
General security.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.020
Although there is nothing certain

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.980
today, you have as an organization

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980
the support of an organization.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.540
Then you have the red pill.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.580
If you get fired, you are dismissed.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.200
exactly to.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.080
You are standing.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.940
And those things.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.360
You are in theory on vacation.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.940
And then you have the red pill, which

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.100
is the one to undertake, where you

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.300
don’t know if your company will exist

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.620
tomorrow, if you can pay the fee

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.040
at the end of the month, you won’

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.020
t have holidays or weekends,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.420
but you will be the owner of your

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.480
own destiny.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.160
So, well, then I am in a kind of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.280
madness, because to undertake you

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.200
have to have a little of that passion

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840
of that madness, because I decided

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.680
to take the red pill.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.060
I remember then when I told my mother,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.160
that she also had a son on the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.240
way who is a civil servant,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.800
who left a job, I earned

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.120
my life very well, because

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.960
to mount a thing on the internet.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.300
But when I started and discount

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.160
coupons.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.560
The year?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.240
This was in 2009.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.820
We were the first to introduce the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.220
concept of coupons to Europe.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.160
Was the group growing?

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.320
No, no, Group in the United States,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.940
and we are the first to launch

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.020
it in Europe.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.620
And then, well, you’re crazy,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.200
what are you doing,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.760
right?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.320
But well, in this madness,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.260
let’s say, we launched the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.100
company, and the truth was a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.000
very positive experience, and very

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.740
quickly, after two years we had

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.120
already sold the company.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.120
We did a good deal, a company participated

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.640
by Amazon, and, well, since

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.860
then you committed

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.880
me a while with them, a few

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.340
months.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.100
Did you sell in two years?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.700
In two years I sold from zero.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.040
From zero, practically 20 million

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.260
subscribers, 600 people, presence

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.460
in six countries.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.680
I was very quick, I turned the clock,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.120
in the morning I was going to Europe,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.620
in the afternoons Latam, and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.160
in the nights of bandar pasta

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.980
in the United States.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.400
I imagine that two years later, it

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.160
is happening to us a little too,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.560
it is as if it seems impossible

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.780
for you that so little time has passed,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.020
because so many things have

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.100
happened to you.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.820
Absolutely of course.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.060
How is it possible?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.700
It seems physically impossible, right?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.240
Absolutely of course.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.860
You don’t realize and you get into

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.620
that vortex of adrenaline, of

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.620
enjoyment and growth, and it was tremendous.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.400
And then, when I sold the company,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.820
after that period that one always

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.360
stays, let’s say, that was less than

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.280
a year, because I say, well, and

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.700
now what do I do?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.760
I say, because now I am mounting my

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.620
own capital fund, I am dedicated

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.040
to investing in startups, I take,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.380
as it was very hard and very tired

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.040
at the personal level and so, I take

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.620
a period of two years, a long vacation

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.500
time, and I said, well, because

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.740
I took a vacation, and when it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.100
took two weeks, at the end I thought,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.020
but if I really what I am interested

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.180
in is this to undertake, the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.420
adrenaline is to throw it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.800
to zero companies and see it

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.680
grow, right?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.060
And then it was when, I called, we

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.700
talked to Gerard, who had already

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.880
worked with him and we knew

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.080
because he had a very powerful

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.240
online marketing agency in Barcelona,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.200
and we decided to launch

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.620
Antaim together, let’s say, as

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.880
a factory of companies, to continue

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.820
doing it in an industrial way, if

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.940
you want, because what we already

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.760
had, let’s say, the experience,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.260
and then we decided to launch

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.160
Antaim with that, with the aim

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.480
of continuing to undertake, that

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.380
in the end is what puts me,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.560
because undertaking is like

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.500
a drug, and when you take the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.580
red pill, let’s say, you can’

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.100
t go back.
