00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.600
Today we will go into the detail

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.340
of one of the main blocks of

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.860
Canvas, which is the revenue flows.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.680
This is what many people mean

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.960
when they talk about business model,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.560
but you already know now that

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.520
it's a mistake, that the business

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.480
model is something much wider

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.460
than the nine blocks.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.620
But there are a lot of people who talk

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.900
about business model and think it's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.280
just the flow of income and maybe

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.620
it relates it to the flow of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.680
expenses.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.560
What we will see is a list of

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960
the different possibilities that

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700
a company has to earn money.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.520
And you'll probably tell me later that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.240
it's pretty obvious.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.200
Yes, it is very obvious.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.200
And when you see them you will say

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.380
it is common sense, but I'm sure

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.560
if I ask you now, of the eight we're

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.960
going to see you can say three

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.740
or four as much.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.500
And what I always say, and I would

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
like to emphasize, is that acquiring

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.400
this type of knowledge, acquiring

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.440
the theory, even if it is common

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.620
sense, even if it is to reinforce

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.720
it is super enriching.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.260
Why is it?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.280
Because it allows you to have a solid

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.720
foundation on which to build, on

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.080
which to innovate.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.660
If you face the challenge of evolving

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.960
a business model, it's much easier

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.640
for you to think about it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.740
Look for a formula, for example, for

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.920
monetization freemium or subscription

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.740
or for advertising or whatever, if

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.660
you have, if you have assimilated

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.960
very well, if you are aware

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560
of all the formulas there.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.660


00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.000
If you don't know it, if you don't have it

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.860
present, it's impossible for you to think of it.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.420
Well, it's easier to be creative

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.080
from a solid knowledge of the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.580
theory.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.940
Well, let's see, these are the eight

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.980
formulas and we'll go looking

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.080
at them one by one.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.740
The first is the easiest, the most obvious,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.060
is the sale of products.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.340
It is independent and independent the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.860
channel through which you sell them.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.320
You can sell products through

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.540
an online e-commerce channel

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.100
like Zappos, for example, or

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.080
sell cars as a dealer,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.380
for example.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.840
The point is that you are

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.160
the owner, you have control

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.440
of some goods you sell, if

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.040
you usually charge a margin for it.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.340
The second, the most common,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.980
is the sale of services.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.320
Services are usually consumed in

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.200
quota per use.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.860
The more you consume of a service,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.600
the more you pay.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.920
A hotel charges for the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.000
nights it sells.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.800
There are cases, and I put this

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.400
as an example, because in many cases

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.640
business models combine several

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.820
different sources of income

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.220
and in the previous case we have

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.560
seen of the car dealer, because

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.540
it also sells services because

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.980
it sells reviews and other

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.240
kinds of services.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.860
Globo is a mobile application

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.360
that offers services of urban

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.520
transport, transport of goods

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.540
or receipts, etc.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.860
As you sell more, you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.520
get more.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.960
What is obvious?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.920
It sounds very obvious, yes, but it's

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.040
a totally variable income.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.640
If it does not sell services, it does not

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.380
charge and that also

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.520
generates seasonalities, etc.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.820
A law firm has several income

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.540
models, you can have them,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.480
but one of them is variable.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560
If you can capture customers with

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.920
new cases, you will charge for that

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.980
particular case.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.770
And what I am going to do is that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.590
there is another formula, which

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.610
is subscription, that unlike

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.710
the variable income as in

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.970
the previous cases, in this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.930
case, we that there is a totality

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.370
or at least a part of income

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.390
that is recurrent, that is a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.610
fixed monthly.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.430
Subscriptions have always been given.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.750
There have been subscriptions of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.950
all kinds, after subscribing, for

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.890
example, to the press, but in the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.530
digital world they are growing a lot.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.410
Netflix, for example, pays a monthly

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.450
fee of between 8 and 12 euros

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.950
and you have the right to all the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.990
content that Netflix has licensed.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.650
Amazon is an example of how companies

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.870
are looking for this recurring

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.850
income.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.510
Amazon had an e-commerce, then a marketplace

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.210
and what it does is incorporate

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.830
Amazon Prime, which is a service

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.330
with certain added values with

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.650
respect to the rest of customers

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.170
for which you pay a monthly

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.390
fee.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.970
It is a movement that is being

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.670
very common and the subscription

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.190
share in the B2B world,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.110
business to business and in the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.570
digital world, is growing

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.830
a barbarity.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.130
And I'll put you as an example,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.670
we at The Power Envy pay

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.050
a lot of quotas to very

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.710
different companies, mostly

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.770
software companies.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.230
It is what is called software

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.930
as a service, which you offer from

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.050
CRM, platform management,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.810
social media imagining, emailing,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.110
marketing automation, etc.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.890
There are a lot of companies,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.490
especially American

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.850
companies, here it is growing

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.330
but we go a little behind, that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.050
offer software services to other

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.070
companies in these formats,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.610
in subscription format and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.250
what is happening is

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.150
that companies are increasingly

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.970
paying more monthly fees

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.610
for services of this

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.650
type.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.630
The freemium, freemium is a

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.990
concept that incorporates a free service

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.250
plus a premium service and the case

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.810
of the most well-known is that

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.870
of Dropbox, Spotify too that we

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.570
will see in detail.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.890
Dropbox, almost all of us have been

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.910
or are basic users of Dropbox for

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.990
free, but if you want to have more

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.030
storage, other services

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.430
you have to pay the fee, the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.210
premium fee, free plus premium

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.390
is equal to freemium.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.950
Wallapop, for example, there are many,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.310
especially is being given in the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.510
world applications, in companies

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.830
that have millions of users, that

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.890
the way to start making money

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.310
is incorporated into premium

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.090
services, such as Wallapop.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.370
Wallapop until not long ago did

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.470
not have a way to earn money from

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.290
its users, only advertising.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.010
Well, because there is incorporated

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.670
a premium quota or a premium payment,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.170
which I do not know if it is quota

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.110
or payment that allows you

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.090
to place your ads, the ads you

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.570
put on Wallapop of second-hand products,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.130
give them more visibility.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.060
Another classic formula for earning

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.880
money that has always been given is

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.640
the broker, it is the intermediation

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.060
and the intermediation is given

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.320
in circumstances in models of this

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.880
way to charge in the marketplaces,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.280
in the digital platforms, which

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.080
they do is put in common offer

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.580
and demand and when a transaction

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.220
is generated, because the platform

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.180
like Airbnb charges a percentage

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.560
of that, or as booking,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.660
for example.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.320
But well, as that other life said,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.240
because here we have an immovable

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.420
agent, the immovable agent,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.000
his model of collection, his income

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.340
flow, that is a percentage on

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.140
the transaction, on the operation

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.060
that was done thanks to

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.560
its intermediation.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.100
A credit card would be like

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.120
that.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.890
In all cases, despite the fact that

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.950
they are business models as we

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.210
have seen totally different,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.770
in all cases the particularity

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.590
is that you do not sell or lend

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.490
the service, but what you do is

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.950
put in common the supply and demand.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.800
One of the main ways to make

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.140
money is advertising and it's

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.280
something we have to understand

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.840
very well, because the opportunities

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.340
are huge, although now

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.420
you may not be aware.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.060
This is the world's digital

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.400
economy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.120
Who has traditionally made a lot

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.420
of money from advertising?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.380
Well, because the media

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.840
or if you had advertising

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.100
space, people hired space

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.480
on sites that had a lot

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.280
of visibility.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.460
But things have changed and now

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.780
there are millions of and millions

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.780
of people in the world who

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.200
make money from advertising.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.380
Google Adsense, for example, allows

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.600
you to make money if you have a

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.640
blog, a website, as soon as you have

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.540
some traffic or enough traffic,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.760
you can already start to make

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.540
money with advertising.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.690
Well, what I want you to keep in mind

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.490
is that today there are millions

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.310
of very different business models,

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.810
apps of all kinds, people who

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.130
create content on blogs, youtubers,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.770
a lot of different business

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.970
models who are making money

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:25.790
from advertising.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.170
So we have to know the formulas,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.870
we have to bear in mind that

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.650
this opportunity exists

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.510
and we will see it in more detail.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.230
A traditional formula for earning

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.970
income is to exploit, to get a

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.590
profitability of assets you have

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.050
and others make use of, because

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.890
it is either a capital you lend

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:46.930
or real estate assets

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.790
you rent, etc.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.470
This is the traditional business of,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.230
for example, a bank.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.850
The last of the formulas we

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.350
will look at are licenses.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.310
Licenses are the income generated

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.710
when you exploit an asset

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:00.950
that is intangible

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.710
or intangible.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.450
For example, an audiovisual

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.390
content maker like Disney earns

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.550
money when it licenses the product

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.830
it has created.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.090
Or if you are a patent owner,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.490
like in the case of Tetra Pak,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.870
then exactly the same.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.570
When a third company makes use

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.810
of your patent, you are making

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.950
money from it.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.250
The software industry has

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.110
always worked.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.390
One of the ways to monetize

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.530
software is by licensing.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.630
For example, here are the offers of

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.970
the office.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.330
The office traditionally you paid

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.090
a license, whatever it was,

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.190
and you could already use

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.450
the office permanently.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.030
Currently, the software world tends

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.450
to pay a subscription fee for

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.910
software as a service.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.950
And now you can actually hire

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.830
the office on a monthly basis, paying

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.110
something every month.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.670
The Office 365.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.550
These are all the formulas

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.430
that exist.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.570
As I said at the beginning of

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.390
the class, it is important that

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.390
we keep them in mind, because when

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.930
we want to evolve or create a

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.530
new business model, it is easier

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.090
to build if you are aware of

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.730
all the formulas that exist.
