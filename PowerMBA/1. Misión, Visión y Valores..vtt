00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.380
Today we will talk about mission,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.640
vision and values.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.240
The first thing I will do

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.700
is briefly define each of the concepts.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.120
Mission determines what you do, what

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.700
you dedicate to, what your purpose

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.640
is, what your reason for being.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.500
The vision that it does is to define

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.800
where we want to get, always starting

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.720
from the mission, which is what

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.860
we do or our purpose is worth,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.340
but starting from that purpose,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.400
what is what we want to, where

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.600
we want to get in the future,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.040
what we want to have an impact on.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.000
And finally, values are the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.200
beliefs or principles that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.580
should permeate absolutely

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.200
all decisions on which we have

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.780
to build the company, what

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.940
we believe in.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.040
Well, mission, mission and values

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.020
are considered in many cases

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.360
to be very theoretical concepts

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.580
and that really do not have a

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.480
practical impact on a company,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.960
etc.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.060
And that is an error.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.580
Why is?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460
Because, by pure common sense, an

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420
organization that has very clear

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.380
what it is dedicated to, where it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.420
wants to get, an organization that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.960
has some principles and that also

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.020
lives in accordance with them, because

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.360
it starts with a much more solid

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.040
base to build absolutely

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040
everything.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.720
That is, mission, mission and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.260
values are the basis of the strategy.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020
They are the basis on which

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.840
strategic goals must

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.000
be defined, on which plans must

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.600
be defined, really on which

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.680
absolutely all decisions

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.040
taken on a daily basis

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.940
must be defined.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.620
We could summarize it as that mission,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.900
mission and values should be a guide

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.100
that every company has and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.160
to which it may turn from time

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.660
to time.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260
By the way, it is proven that companies

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.220
that have very clear their mission,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.720
mission and values, not only

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.900
have it clear, but also have

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.040
shared it with the entire organization,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
that they have achieved

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260
that the entire culture of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.700
the organization is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.820
impregnated by these principles,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.860
because they basically work

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.940
better, get better results.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.060
But it is that we will take it to a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.540
personal level, because I am sure you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.100
are with me that if a person

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.060
has very clear what he is engaged

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.520
in or what he does, what is his

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.480
mission, what are his goals, what

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.300
are his principles and lives according

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.640
to those principles, he is consistent

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.640
with them, systematically,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.780
that people get further,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.660
yes or yes.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.400
And the opposite, which happens

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
to very many companies and very many

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.920
people, is to be untouched, to give

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100
downstairs, etc.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.140
Well, in reality, what is

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.820
happening?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.280
Well, because the reality is that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.120
the big companies all have

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520
worked their mission, mission

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
and values, but basically in

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760
many cases what they have done

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
has been simply writing them, in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.320
many cases they are accessible

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.080
on the web page, etc.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.980
But of course, if you only write it and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.640
it does not transcend the organization,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.000
it is not worth anything, it has

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.460
no practical effect.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.420
In many cases, small

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.480
have never been able

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.360
to do so.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.740
It is true that sometimes leaders

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.160
can have the mission, mission and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.660
values more or less clear in their

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.880
head, innately, it may be, but

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.000
what we always recommend is that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.160
in addition to working it, reflect

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.740
on them, write it, it will help

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.920
you to consolidate them, it will

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.160
help you to have a course,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.340
it will help you to have

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.360
a guide.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.280
Now we will go deeper into each of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.200
them, mission, mission and values,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840
and we will relate it to the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.180
case of The Power MBA.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.920
The goal, what we want is to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.320
visualize what the impact

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.200
in practice, in the real life

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.140
of companies of having worked

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.460
the mission, vision and

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.860
values.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.740
And we start with the mission, which,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.460
as I told you, in the mission what

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.540
we do is to define what we do, what

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.700
is our reason for being, what we

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.560
dedicate ourselves to and why it is

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.820
important to have worked the mission.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.740
There are many reasons, but we can highlight

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.660
three.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.420
One, because the first thing, having

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.280
very clear what you do and also writing

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.920
it allows you to inform the rest

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.760
of the world.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.280
It allows you to make it clear to everyone

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.000
what you do, everyone who they are,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.660
because they are employees,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.960
they are partners, they can be

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.580
your partners, they can be your

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.340
suppliers, your customers, etc.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.260
It is easier if you have very clear

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.340
what you are doing, communicate

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.620
it to the outside.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.780
Two, when the mission of

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.700
a company, when your purpose is

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.980
very clear, this helps to inspire

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.060
you within the organization,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.240
since employees, managers,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.760
etc., are able to develop

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.000
new proposals within

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.440
that mission.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.620
That is, the mission can be

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.900
inspiring to create more value.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.940
Third, the mission helps us

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.400
make decisions.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.840
Let me give you an example,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.800
the Power MBA case.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.180
What is our mission?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.720
Well, our mission is to help thousands

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.120
of people acquire the business

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.420
knowledge that we consider

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.740
to be key to growing

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.960
professionally.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.380
And we do so by starting from a few

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.880
principles and it is that our students

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.280
do not have to compromise their

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.120
rhythm of life or their finances.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.920
This is our mission.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.260
Well, all entrepreneurs are pressing

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.340
us thousands of opportunities to

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.200
grow and we are always at risk

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.600
of losing focus.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.260
And the mission helps us to be clear

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.240
about what we are doing.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.000
In this case, we could, for example,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.560
create programs using our

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.360
methodology and there would

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.040
also be synergies.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.820
For example, these programs,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.960
imagine, are an example of learning

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.460
to program.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.590
We have databases, we have the methodology,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.710
we have the resources, we could

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.130
do it perfectly and make money,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.130
but that's not our mission.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.990
We have clearly stated that

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.490
our mission is to share knowledge

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.770
related to business,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.050
strategy, marketing, etc.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.570
Programming is out of that.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.350
It's an example that I want to

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.050
illustrate why, to be very clear

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.850
about what we do.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.650
Being very clear allows us to make

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.230
the right decisions.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.330
Now, let's go to the vision.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.570
Where do we want to get?

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.850
What impact do we want to have?

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.770
Well, I think it's common sense

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.630
that having very clear goals

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.830
always helps us and we go back

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.010
to the personal plane.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.250
When you are very clear about what

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.410
your vision is, I am convinced that

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.570
it is easier for you to

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.710
make the effort, to overcome

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.550
the barriers, to take the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.710
right steps to reach that vision.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.150
Whether your vision is to quit smoking

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.850
or if your vision is to get in shape

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.270
or have a happy marriage, well,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.670
the clearer we have the vision,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.750
the easier it will be for us

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.610
to take the right steps to it.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.430
In the case of Power MBA, well,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.370
because our vision is to

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.510
revolutionize the training

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.410
sector in the world.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.150
That is our vision.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.310
We cannot be a profitable

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.230
company.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.350
We cannot stay doing the

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.150
same as others.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.710
And every time we make strategic

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.630
decisions, we make them with

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.570
vision in mind.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.670
What we want to is revolutionizing

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.010
the education sector

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.850
in the world.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.790
So we have to do things differently,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.210
we have to think about the customer,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.890
we have to launch a very aggressive

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.630
international expansion

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.910
because we want to revolutionize

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.670
the training sector

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.730
in the world.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.630
It is very important to always be

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.090
very clear about your vision.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.590
You will then set strategic

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.390
goals at the lowest level.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.750
And finally, let's go to the values,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.990
which is something we love.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.710
Values are those principles you believe

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.770
in and that must impregnate

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.610
everything you do.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.390
And by the way, I want you to keep

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.670
in mind that values are more important

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.990
in the corporate world every

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.450
day.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.760
In fact, as proof of this, whether

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.240
we look at the communications of

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.680
the best managed companies or the

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.040
largest, they are putting more

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.360
and more focus on values.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.340
They are talking less and less

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.620
about products, functions, and so on.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.400
What they try to transmit is

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.980
to build their proposals from

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.160
values, to transmit those values

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160
and that you feel identified

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.360
with them.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.380
Why is?

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.640
Because basically customers prefer

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.280
to buy or prefer brands with

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.940
whose values they feel

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.200
identified, whose values

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.640
they like.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.940
But not just brands, it's that

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.660
we act like that in general in life.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.580
You choose people, political

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.020
parties, whatever, no matter, products,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.460
as long as you are aligned

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.720
with those values.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.880
So the first of the benefits is

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.080
that you will sell more, you will

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.840
connect better with your customers,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.480
and so on.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.620
But also, values are very important

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.260
in attracting and retaining

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.860
talent.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.140
It is common sense too.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.760
We all like to work in companies

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.780
where we like their

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.400
values.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.260
I don't know, transparency,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.960
honesty, and so on.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.100
The opposite is terrible.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.740
If you work in an organization for

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.440
a company, whether large or small,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.440
you don't believe in the values

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.760
it transmits, you don't believe

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.900
in the values on which it is

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.420
based, because it's really very

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.620
discouraging.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.580
By the way, there's an interesting

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.800
reflection here and it's that

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.860
values aren't created or written,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.080
that is, this isn't going to say,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.220
well, my values are four

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.000
values that sound good.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.960
No, that has no impact.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.640
What is really important is

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.700
what is discovered.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.820
Values start, usually in

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.240
small companies, from

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.760
founders, CEOs, and CEOs

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.060
who pass it on to the

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.900
entire organization.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.200
And in larger companies, values

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.660
are really impregnated

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.040
in culture.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.800
And I encourage you to do

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.600
the exercise, the diagnosis

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.020
of thinking or identifying what

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.120
are the main values in your

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.900
company or in the company you work for.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.810
And finally, I will share with

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.070
you two of the main principles,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.750
values, beliefs that we have at

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.890
The Power MBA on which we have

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.690
built the company and that we

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.370
also try to impregnate

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.010
our decisions in the day-

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.530
to-day, everything we do.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.730
I will give you two examples.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.290
The goal is to see how the

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.730
principles, the values, really

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.790
have a practical utility,

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.830
which is not just a matter

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.370
of writing them or saying them.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.670
The first is absolute

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.830
transparency.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.510
We believe that both on a personal

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.370
and professional level you will be

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.710
better off if you are always transparent

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.730
and sincere.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.170
What is this concrete in

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.750
our case?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.070
For example, in the relationship

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.850
with employees.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.070
Very close, without the caret, without the

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.150
role of employed boss.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.190
In the relationship with customers.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.570
We have no problem

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.050
and have done so many times.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.810
Sometimes we are surprised to recognize

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.250
things we are not doing well.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.050
Be humble and say, well, we haven'

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:04.890
t done it well, but we can improve

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.110
and we want your help.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.410
In the relationship with partners,

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.130
with the media, with suppliers, etc.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.550
Always seeking absolute

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.990
honesty and transparency.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.480
There are also a number of

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.500
other principles we want to discuss

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.980
with regard to the proposal, as

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.380
to how it should be to learn.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.140
In particular, and it is something

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.600
that has transcended and that

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.520
is the basis almost of our value

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.020
proposal, that we want higher-

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.060
level learning to be

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.160
accessible to everyone.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.340
We don't understand why learning

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.860
from the best or learning from business

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.720
issues, etc., has to have the

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.140
highest costs, has to be for

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.120
very few people.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:43.900
We want it to be accessible

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.720
to everyone.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.400
This leads us to fix a price for

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.320
programs with the aim of making

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.360
them accessible.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.820
And look, it may be a strategy

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.740
that isn't the best way

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.860
to make money.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.940
Maybe we could make money or be

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.200
more profitable with higher

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.360
prices, but this is what

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.400
we want, so we have to be faithful

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.880
to this.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.120
And we also want that if you are faithful

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.560
to your principles like we are to

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.380
this one, in the medium or long

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.620
term you will be much better.
