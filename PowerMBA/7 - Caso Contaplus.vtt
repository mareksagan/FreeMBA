00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.760
Alvaro, tell us how it all started,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.560
where the idea came from, how you

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.100
took the first steps.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.720
Well, because like everything in this

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.380
life the planets aligned and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.960
many things happened, and apart

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.480
we were at the right time, prepared,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.780
and the market demanded it.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.600
All these things, until they happen,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.100
there is really no success in

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.980
any business.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.520
I’ll tell you a little anecdote,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440
because it was very interesting.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.880
The Plus Account came from a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.180
dentist who ordered us a program

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.440
and didn’t like it.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.480
He commissioned us a accounting

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.460
program for his business, as a dentist,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.940
and when we delivered it to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.800
him he didn’t like it.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.980
And then, from that accounting

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.460
core that emerged, from this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.680
dentist, we started working

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.000
on a accounting program.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.240
And at that moment the idea came,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.500
and the idea was, I as his engineer,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.280
always all mathematically, came

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.140
from an equation in which you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.660
said, we sell 500 programs

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.640
to 300,000 pessets, I am talking

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.660
about those when we lived

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.220
in pessets, we sold 500 programs

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340
to 300,000 pessets.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.680
What happens if we

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.960
change the equation?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.540
And we sell 300,000 programs for 500 pesetas.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.440
The final sum is the same, but

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.680
the formula is completely

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.400
different.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780
That idea came up one night between

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.220
my partner and me, and that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.320
was exactly what we did.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.260
What we did is that a product that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.580
cost at that time 300,000 pesetas,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.780
because I don’t know, we are

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.060
talking at best of 8000 euros

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.860
today, because we sold

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.320
it to 4.950 pesetas.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.280
And then, instead of selling 500

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.080
products, the idea was to sell

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.160
100,000 products.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.780
That idea arose in our head, as they

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.700
arise in entrepreneurs of these ideas

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.940
that invade you and your life disappears,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.400
you just see that.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.700
And then, at the moment that idea

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.140
came up, there was nothing else

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.200
in our lives.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.780
There was no family, there was nothing.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.320
We are working to transform

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.540
this equation.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.140
The first thing we said was, how

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.320
can we sell 300,000 products of

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.400
a thing that is not massive?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.320
So, let’s see, where

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.800
do people go every day?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.520
What is the usual sales channel?

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.920
The newspaper kiosks.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.700
We said, the newspapers

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.160
are our point of sale.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.640
Never in his life had he sold

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.620
a soba in the newspaper kiosks.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.520
What can we sell in the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.160
newspaper kiosks?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.380
At what price can we sell it?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.520
We went to a newspaper kiosk,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.700
we went to several newspaper kiosks

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.920
and the most expensive that was

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.520
sold, I will continue to talk about

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.100
pessetas, because it was, I don't

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.980
know, an encyclopedia that cost 500

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.220
pessetas.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.180
What is happening?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.640
We made the channel because

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.260
the margin we gave the kiosk was

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.100
so big that selling a Plus account

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.900
earned the same as selling

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360
all the newspapers, the country

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.580
or the world of the day.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.780
All those combinations

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.860
arose, we mortgaged our houses,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.420
of course, to make a television

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.120
advertising campaign, because

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.220
as it was massive, then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.460
I’m telling you a little about

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.340
how it arose.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.440
We made a television campaign, we

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.940
recorded an ad with our friends

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.280
because we logically didn’t

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.520
have money, but of course, we had

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.620
to spend ads on television, that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.680
that cost a lot of money, for

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.920
that we had to mortgage the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.840
houses because the media wholesalers

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.880
didn’t trust, these lords,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.740
who are they?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.860
We made a campaign, we blisted, we

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.180
blisted with three and a half and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.760
five and a quarter disquets, prehistoric

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.320
things for today, we prepared it,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.100
we put it on the channels,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.880
we distributed it and finally

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.300
we sold four million copies

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.780
in no way how many years.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.420
But I explained a little what was

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.040
the key to success, the key was

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.320
the change of equation, the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.100
market was mature, I was waiting

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.360
for a massive solution, it

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.680
was a good product, it had

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.460
technical support, then people

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.780
didn’t notice they didn’t know what

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.040
that product was for, they

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.620
called by phone and there was

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.360
a person behind him who answered.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.660
All these components together that

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.520
when you analyze them

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.760
individually are not so important,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.360
but when you see them in the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.600
concept you realize that we

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720
had been able to suit the needs

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.800
of the demand that there was

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800
exactly at that time.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.840
And well, because it started, this

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.440
was just to give you an anecdote,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.680
Borja, we had not launched

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.380
the advertisement and sold all

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.060
the products we had placed.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.480
And I saw myself watching the TV that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.980
the ad was coming out and there were

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.080
no products, because they had already

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.860
sold all.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.200
And to get back back in the ball cost

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.840
us more time than the campaign lasted,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.580
that is, a thing already crazy,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.380
but well, so was the ball.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.260
So what happens?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.060
We did not get mad at that moment

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.080
and what we did was reinvest

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.340
all that amount of money that

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.660
came into us every day, create

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.360
a support, a service that would

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.300
support all that success and

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.060
that was the key to maintenance.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.280
That is, we did not see it

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.680
really as a ballot, we saw

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.820
it as we were meeting the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.460
needs that the Spanish society

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.920
in SMEs was demanding.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.680
We had a problem and it was that every

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.740
three months the buildings

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.180
were getting small.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.340
I remember in the Pradillo street,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.880
behind the world, we picked up

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.660
a 2,000-meter building and

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.800
we said, and how long will

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.320
this last?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.780
I said, man, this takes us five or ten

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.340
years.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.380
In six months we sold it and went

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.740
to one of 5,000 meters, then to

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.100
one of 10,000 meters, because

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.100
our call centers, of course,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.100
we received 15,000 calls

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.080
a day.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.160
We were the only ones in Spain

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.640
that collapsed the Spanish

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.500
telephone lines when there was

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.940
the change of the 2,000.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.680
You remember that it seemed like everything

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.060
was going to stop because computers

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.940
were changing.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.680
At that time, we had over

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.800
400,000 customers in Spain.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.680
They decided to call us almost

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.540
all at once and we collapsed

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.460
the Spanish phone nodes.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.380
He called us and said, What’

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.400
s going on?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.900
We don’t have enough lines for all

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.280
the people who are trying to

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.960
get into you.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.060
This has not only stopped with

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.560
Operation Triumph and with you.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.540
So what you imagine.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.300
So, back a little to your question,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.940
it was a series of circumstances

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.280
in which we were able to

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.660
meet what the market demanded

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.320
at that time.
