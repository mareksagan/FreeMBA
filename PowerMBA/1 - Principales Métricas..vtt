WEBVTT

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.480
To understand how the growth

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.420
engine works and to be able to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.540
manage growth in the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.260
startup, we must be able to answer

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.500
four questions and also we

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.780
must be able to know and use the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.920
metrics that give us a permanent

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.200
answer to how much each

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.940
customer generates, how much

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.660
it costs us to capture each

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.420
customer, how much we earn

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.680
with each customer and in

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.300
how long we will recover

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.900
the investment we make in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.940
capturing it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.060
We'll go question by question and

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.080
we'll go learning what the most

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.820
important metrics that inform

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.100
us about this are.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.020
The first is how much it costs us,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.820
how much a customer generates us.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.460
The most important metrics you have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.960
to know very well, which probably already

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.860
sounds to you, is the customer lifetime

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100
value, which is the acronym for

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.280
the value of the customer throughout

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.160
their life.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.720
That is, what informs us is how much

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.480
a customer will generate during the

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.900
time it is a customer of average

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.740
and how it is measured.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.060
There are different ways to measure

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.620
it depending on the different

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.400
business models.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.620
Let's think of a model, for

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.860
example, Netflix.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.480
The customer lifetime value is

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.540
calculated from another very important

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.360
metric that is the ARPU, would

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.680
be the customer lifetime, what a

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.780
customer generates throughout his

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980
life is equal to the average income

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.520
that this customer generates

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.620
for a period of time.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.720
We think of a month by the lifetime,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.340
that is, by the average number

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.460
of months throughout the customer's

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.240
life.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.480
Therefore, as you can see, we have

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.380
used another metric, which is the ARPU,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.260
which is the average revenue per

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.900
user, the income per user or per

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.020
average customer.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.340
We'll think of Netflix, as I said.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.500
Netflix has three plans, which would

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.780
be Netflix's monthly ARPU, would

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.080
be a weighted average between the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.340
prices of each of the plans by

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.940
the number of customers that

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.040
is hosted to each plan.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.920
Imagine it is 10 euros.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What is the customer lifetime

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.960
value of Netflix?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.240
How much does Netflix get

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.320
for each customer you have

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.180
in your lifetime?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.360
The average monthly amount of 10 euros

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640
is multiplied by the average monthly

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800
amount of 10 months.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.640
How many months

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.620
on Netflix?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.740
I don't know, probably they

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.760
haven't even been able to measure

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.020
it yet, because they don't

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.640
have enough time to measure it.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.520
But let's say it's 60 months.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.640
The customer lifetime value

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.780
on Netflix is 600 euros.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.640
It is a very important fact, because depending

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.560
on what you will get from each customer

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.640
throughout their life you will

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.340
be able to invest more or less

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.340
in capturing it.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.960
We'll think about a gym.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.240
How do we calculate the customer

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.940
lifetime value?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.540
Well, because it is very simple.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.660
If the gym fee is 50 euros per

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.400
month, what you have to do

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.760
is multiply that fee by the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.720
average months.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660
How many years is a customer

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.800
in a gym?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.480
And what they have to do is analyze

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.800
their data and say, well, because on

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.600
average it is three and a half years.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.780
The number of months must be

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.180
multiplied by 50 euros per month.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.560
But of course, not all are like

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.580
that.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.260
In fact, let's think now about a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.720
business, for example, like Hawkers.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.760
The glasses of teeth.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.160
It makes no sense to calculate the ARPU,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.200
because it is not a subscription

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.920
model, but in this case what we would

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.300
do would be How much do we

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.800
get with each of the glasses?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.500
What is the average price?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.200
I don't know, 40 euros.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.920
I do not know.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.580
How many glasses does

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.820
a person buy in a lifetime?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.020


00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.560
What is the repetition?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.800
The customer lifetime value

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.880
is estimated.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.480
A Hawkers customer buys four,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.800
six, ten, twelve, twenty

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.420
glasses in their lifetime.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.960
I do not know.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.840
Well, because that's how you calculate

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.040
what you'll get from that customer throughout

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.760
your life.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.160
The second of the levers or answers

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.380
is How much does it cost to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.140
capture each customer?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.460
And the very important metric is the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.180
CAC, and is the customer's purchase

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.200
cost.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.280
This metric is easy to calculate.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.600
Just as the customer lifetime

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.920
value is an estimate, in this

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.740
case it is simpler.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.000
Why is it?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.180
Because what you do is sum up what

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.320
you have spent on marketing, on

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.180
sales, over a period of time that

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.720
is sufficiently representative,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.280
the past year, for example, and

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.680
divide it between the number

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.020
of customers you have captured.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.380
You know how much it

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.280
costs to get each customer.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.840
So far very simple.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.900
Now let us see.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.200
We already have information to know

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.940
how much we earn from each of our customers.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.040
And how do we do it?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.820
We are going to get what we

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.900
get from the customer throughout

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.840
his life less the cost of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.920
capture, less what we cost to capture him.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.880
And it is very simple.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.140
The customer lifetime value

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.540
or lifetime value must be

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.820
higher than the customer's

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.400
purchase cost.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.040
It is very obvious, what happens is that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.020
it doesn't always happen.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.640
And there are times when

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.600
it is more difficult

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.360
than it is.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.040
It is often said that this

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.120
has to be a balance.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.180
That is, if your customer lifetime

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.540
value is very high, you can invest

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.940
more in capturing your customers,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.000
but it always has to be

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.580
superior.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.740
That's why it's sometimes drawn like

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.580
a scale because you can play with it.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.920
If you can, for example,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.920
increase prices or cross-sale

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.960
or increase the repetition or

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.320
retention of your customers, etc.,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.120
and you are able to get more money,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.680
have more money your customers,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.960
imagine a competitor, what you

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.120
can do at that time is to play

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.720
with that balance and be more

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.080
permissive, invest more in

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.560
the cost of customer acquisition

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.780
looking for less efficiency,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.420
for example, which will

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.200
allow you to win market

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.560
share to your customer.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.680
Your competitor is the most

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.600
suited.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.600
As I said, it is a balance.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.880
In addition, this balance varies in

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.420
time because there are times in the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.120
launch or before reaching the breakeven,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.480
to the dead point, it is given in

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.780
many cases that the cost of customer

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.340
acquisition, that the cost of

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.500
customer acquisition is greater

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.160
than the lifetime value.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.420
At that point, as you put here,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.600
you are in a zone of death,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.480
the breakeven has not yet been reached.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.980
You have to optimize

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.360
both so that it gets

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.040
older.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.860
In many cases, this equation is

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.040
put forward as such, not as a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.820
rest, but what is done is calculated

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.440
how many times the amount you

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.320
get from a customer is greater

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.740
than what you cost to

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.100
capture it.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.400
And it depends, there are bars

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.780
or there are standards depending

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.380
on the sectors, but it is usually used,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.380
it is usually said or many investors

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.420
consider that at least it has to

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.860
be three times higher.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.660
What you get over a customer's

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.680
lifetime must be at least

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.180
three times more than what

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.720
you cost to catch it.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.380
And the last of the perspectives, now

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.140
that we already know how much we

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.260
get from a customer, how much it costs

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.520
us to capture it, how much we

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.820
earn for the customer.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.300
The last of the prospects is, in how

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.100
long we recover that investment

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.520
that we make in capturing the customer,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.980
because it is also important.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.520
You think that if it costs you 12 months

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.960
to recover what you invest in the

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.380
acquisition of that customer, you

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.900
will have to finance the

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.260
growth during those 12 months, you

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.620
will need a lot of money.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.060
But if it is almost immediate,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.600
then the opposite.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.160
This metric is given by the

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.420
payback, the payback of the customer

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.040
acquisition cost.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.860
And it also depends, obviously, on

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.900
the customer, what you have from

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.840
the customer and when you get it,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.100
compared to the cost of acquisition.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.840
I will give you two examples,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.060
of business models and

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.100
income models.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.540
Think about your lottery.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.280
Your lottery catches customers,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.880
which costs you x to catch it,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.700
and you get the customer level

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.740
you get as that customer

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.880
becomes a recurring player

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.800
and buys their lottery bets

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.920
every week.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.220
So you invest today in

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.160
capturing a client and recovering

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.620
it over a few months,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.020
as that player plays.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.640
The margin of each of those

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.240
games you make, or of the bets.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.440
Payback is a few

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.940
months.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.860
I will not give the data.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.720
However, there are other models, and

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.680
I will compare it to you, for example,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.600
with The Power MBA, in which you invest.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.980
We invest in capturing customers

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.860
through different channels.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.240
It is X to get a customer.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.300
But the benefit in this case, relative

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.700
to the other model, is that the customer

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.580
lifetime value, which you get

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.540
throughout the customer's life,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.060
is not distributed.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.420
There are two payment methods, but

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.720
on the payment that is not postponed,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.760
it is not distributed over time.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.840
But you get it from the beginning.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.820
Therefore, the payback, the time period

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.980
in which you recover that investment,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.160
is much shorter.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.600
This is a benefit to the other

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.100
model.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.520
The shorter the time period

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.800
in which you recover that investment,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.640
well, because you have to finance,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.400
you have to contribute

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.240
less money to finance that growth.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.600
Or, with the same money, what

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.820
you can do is grow faster.
