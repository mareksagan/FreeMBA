WEBVTT

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.300
What we’re going to do now

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.460
is think of a real, running

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.760
company that I’ve picked up

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.580
randomly, that’s come to my mind

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.180
because I know one of the founders

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.060
and we’re going to relate

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.960
it to what we’ve learned,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.700
to the process of marketing

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.680
strategy.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.860
The company is G-stock, it is

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.820
a small software manufacturer, it is

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.460
a software specialized in the management

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.060
of inventories, purchases, etc.,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420
which allows you to better

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.080
manage your stock, your purchases,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.700
optimize your operations,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.680
increase your profitabilities

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000
and so on.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280
And it is aimed at a niche, because

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.880
this software could be used by

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.480
stores from different sectors,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.700
but it is actually aimed at restaurants.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.920
You already understand the business.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.240
Now let’s link it to the process

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.660
of marketing strategy.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.080
First, we will see how they have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.840
made the decision to whom to address.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.460
The segmentation.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.740
Remember that you can segment from

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.620
very different variables, geographical,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.580
demographic, profiles, etc.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.080
In the case of G-stock, which ones are

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080
they applying?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.180
Remember, we said they are

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.460
going to restaurants.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
I think geographical segmentation

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000
makes sense because they

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.720
may have decided to go

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720
to restaurants in Spain,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.660
for example.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.580
I don’t know if they’re in an international

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.700
process, but it would be a decision.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Or at least it is a criterion to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.060
be taken into account.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480
The restaurants.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.020
They are segmented according

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.840
to variables.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.340
This is the same as demographic

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.500
variables.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.140
All of the sectors have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.320
focused on restaurants.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.540
Psychological segmentation by profiles.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.400
Do you think it makes sense?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.240
I think it is because it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.620
is a technology company,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.900
it is a software company.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.940
Therefore, within the restaurants

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.360
have decided to go to the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.560
restaurants that have

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.180
a management more, because

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.180
that, more innovative people

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.080
and more.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.400
If you go to a restaurant that is

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.840
managed, very traditional managed,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.580
as 40 years ago, probably

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.040
the G-stock proposal will

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.180
not be silent.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.860
And a very important segmentation

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.140
here basic is that of the need

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.300
or problem that your target audience has.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.680
And in this case it is very clear because

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.420
they have decided, within all the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.720
functionalities that the software

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.600
has, they have decided to create

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.420
a software that is aimed at

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.480
helping you improve, optimize

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.840
your purchases and your stock.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.980
Therefore, it is clear that the creation

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.200
of the product starts from there,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.340
part that they are, part that they

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.920
have segmented the market

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.060
according to the needs.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.880
And their target audience are

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.740
the shops, the restaurants that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.100
have that need, who have that problem

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.000
of managing their stock better.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.960
So you see how you can really

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.280
understand the strategy

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.600
of any company from theoretical

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.380
models.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.300
We have identified the segments.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.780
We have seen that it makes sense

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.760
to geographics, demographics by

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.240
the sector, psychographics by

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.040
the type of profile and also

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800
segmentation according to needs.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.700
And from all this they have

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.440
decided to go to the restaurants,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.540
as we have seen, which is

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.400
the target.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.760
The customer person is to turn

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580
that into a person, it is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.260
a tool that we recommend to do.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.740
But here we will see, we will move

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.380
on to the next stage, a great stage

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.120
that is how G-stock is directed

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.020
to that segment or that customer

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.400
person who has decided to go

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.060
to which are the restaurants.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.400
We start with the positioning that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.760
is more strategic than the marketing

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.400
mix.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.420
In the positioning remember

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.660
that what we have is to look

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.720
for our space, our hole within

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.560
the market.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.960
The market is very

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.200
conditioned, first of all by

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.220
the customers but also by the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.140
competitors.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.880
Then within the software sector

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.680
there are big competitors

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.440
with RPs that include all the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.060
functionalities and within those

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.680
functionalities is the purchase,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.380
inventory, stock management,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.460
which is what G-stock

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.080
does.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.700
And in the software sector,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.920
what it has is software that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.380
is aimed at all sectors, all

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.500
segments and some that are more

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.160
focused on concrete verticals,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.500
verticals in the function

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.700
of the target audience,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.860
the target segment.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.020
The vertical is the restoration,

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.980
the hostels.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.640
I have already drawn

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.200
the picture.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.800
What is the positioning that G-

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800
stock seeks within this entire market?

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.060
It is very much related

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.440
to a niche strategy.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.680
What you want to position is in the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.980
minds of your target audience as

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.520
there are thousands of software but

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.080
I dedicate to what I am dedicated

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.420
to is a software that will

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.960
help you specifically to this,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.860
so I am the best in this, in

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.420
stock management.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.160
And it’s also that my software

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.280
is meant directly for restaurants,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.440
so I understand you

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.480
better than others.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.240
In this case, the positioning

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.520
strategy as I said is very

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.840
related to this niche strategy

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640
that they have decided

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.820
to implement.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.720
And finally from all this G-stock

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.980
that we are not going to go into

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.300
this has to go into, that is, you

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.740
have to decide what the tactics

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.160
of the marketing mix, by the product

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.600
that is the first of them.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.220
What features do these software

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.320
have to incorporate?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.140
The price?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.680
Because the price you will have to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.600
take into account the product, you

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.880
will have to take into account

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.960
who the target audience is, what

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.800
the budgets it has, etc.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.780
The advertising?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.560
How do you get to all these restaurants?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.640
Well, you will have to combine offline-

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.500
offline channels and distribution

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.220
channels, because through them

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.720
they have decided to incorporate

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.700
local distributors that give

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.400
more reach to their software.
