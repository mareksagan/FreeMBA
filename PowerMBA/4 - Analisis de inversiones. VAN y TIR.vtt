00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.590
Today we will talk about BAN and

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.030
TIER, which are the two most well-

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.730
known indicators that are used to

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.910
evaluate, to evaluate the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.430
profitability or viability of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.270
investment projects, of investments.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.590
We will see them together because they

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.910
are very related and understand

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.870
each other better.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.910
Before we define them, I want

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.070
you to keep in mind that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010
when we go from a cash flow

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.830
projection.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.310
A cash flow projection that can

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.590
have different forms, but this would

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.090
be a very simplified one

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.830
in which we have an initial cash

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.530
flow, a negative initial cash

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.150
flow because it is the investment

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.190
we make and that subsequently

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.510
generates a series of

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.590
positive cash flows.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.170
We always have to start from the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.970
projection of a series of cash

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.450
flows.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.790
That is where we will get the ban and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.970
the TER.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.750
We will define both, the two indicators,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.470
the BAN and the TIER.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.990
The BAN is the net current value and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.430
is the economic value created by an

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.950
investment, but it takes into account,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.110
given or starting from a discount

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.210
rate that is representative of the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.110
profitability we demand.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.870
Given that discount rate,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.470
we discount the flows and obtain

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.370
economic value.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.930
The economic value in monetary

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.510
units that can be in euros,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.630
in dollars, etc.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.830
In contrast, the TERER is a different indicator.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.430
The internal return rate that informs

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850
us is the expected return on

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.270
an investment, which is not

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.650
the same as the discount rate.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.290
It can be lower or higher

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.550
or it can be equal to the discount

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.310
rate or the profitability

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.970
we require.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.610
The unit is a percentage

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.110
because it is a measure of profitability.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.790
Let's start with the ban.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.190
The BAN, the formula you already know,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.550
is the present value, the current

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.890
value of an investment.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.110
So what we do is, we have

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.690
a series of cash flows and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.670
we will update them and as we

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.290
said in the definition of the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.970
BAN, given a discount rate.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.190
That is, in this case what we

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.850
will discount is those cash flows

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.570
at the discount rate that is the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.230
profitability we demand.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.410
That does not have to be the actual

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.450
profitability of the project, the expected

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.210
profitability.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.970
This is the minimum profitability we

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.710
require in accordance, if you remember

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.390
in the previous class, based on

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.390
the minimum interest we can get

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.990
without risk plus the risk premium

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.210
and the box is what we demand.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.490
Will we cut those flowers?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.010
The initial cash flow is

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.650
usually the investment.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.490
It is easier to understand it that way.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.170
To better understand the BAN, what

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.270
we will do is apply it to an example.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.910
I'm going to get you in the position

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.710
that we're going to build a gym.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.690
You have three different options because

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.830
you have three different locations.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.910
Three different sizes.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.250
Keep in mind that the size of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.490
the room will determine both the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.810
initial investment you have to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.450
make in repair etc. in machinery,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.330
it will determine the square

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.790
meters of the gym and therefore

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.950
will determine the number

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.590
of partners and income.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.730
It will condition everything.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.210
But we have three alternatives and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.890
we have to calculate or value the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.990
investment in each of them.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.730
Well, let's project the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.330
cash flow.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.010
First, let's see what the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.950
discount rate we will apply.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.370
That being said, let's see what the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.390
minimum profitability we will

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.410
require.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.910
Well, for all three cases, in

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.290
the gym example, we will demand

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.610
the same profitability because

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.910
we perceive the same risk, which

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.210
for example is 20%.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.090
So we are building the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.030
cash flow.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.970
In this case, with a 20%

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.870
discount rate.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.310
Now what we have to do is project

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.630
both the cash flows that will be

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.050
generated as well as the initial

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.890
investment we need.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.450
Let us go case by case.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.650
In the first case, the initial

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.390
investment is 300,000 euros

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390
and cash flows will be generated

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.790
in the next three years

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.910
of 150,000 euros.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.630
If we discount it, we calculate the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.710
current net value, we get a positive

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.510
bank of 16,000 euros.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.670
Let us go to the following case, the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.330
following example.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.090
In this case it is a little

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.210
bigger gym, we have to make a bigger

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.610
investment and it is true

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.710
that we will get a higher

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.610
cash flow.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.430
In this case of 180,000, we discount

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.890
them to 20% and it goes out that

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.570
the current net value is zero.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.960
And we go to the third option, in which

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
it is a more equitable gym, we have

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.060
to make a smaller investment,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.040
in this case we have to invest

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.580
150,000 euros and we will generate

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.080
only 60,000 euros every

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.680
year.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.400
We discount it to 20% and it comes out

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.820
that the current net value is negative,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.460
it is less than 23.000 euros.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.320
So what I would like

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.220
now is that we could interpret

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.500
these results.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.480
We are going to go with the first

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.400
of the gyms, in this case we

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.280
have got a positive bank.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.420
What does this mean?

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.940
Let us think.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.780
What it means is that the actual

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.320
profitability of the project is higher

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.280
than what we demand, it is higher

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.200
than the discount rate.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.560
Please note that we are demanding a

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.080
20%, we do not want less than

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.940
a 20 % for this project because it

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.880
is the risk we perceive,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.720
we are not willing to enter this

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.920
project for less than a 20%,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.260
and it results that with that minimum

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.840
investment of 300,000 euros and

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.540
those projected cash flows,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.380
an additional economic value

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.980
of 16,000 euros is generated.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.840
It is therefore easy, it is intuitive

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.420
to think that the actual

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.120
profitability is higher than the required.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.360
That is, in this case, I incorporate

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.500
the concept of the TIR, the TIR of

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.180
the project, the profitability is

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.740
higher than the discount rate, at

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.060
20%.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.280
Let's go to the next case.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.620
Remember it was a larger gym

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.880
where we were going to get a

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.360
higher cash flow, but at the end

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.260
the current net value is zero.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.300
This means that no added value is created.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.180
Think about it, what profitability do

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.640
you think we are getting in this case?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.400
The profitability is exactly 20%,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.740
in this case where the net

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.400
current value is zero.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.840
The profitability we obtain is exactly

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.260
the same as the minimum required,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260
at 20%.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.700
Therefore, here the TIR, the

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.140
profitability, is equal to the discount

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.100
rate.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.600
I want you to understand all this

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.860
intuitively, because it is the only

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.280
way to assimilate it well.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.040
Let us go to the last case.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.320
It is the smallest gym and it turns

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.000
out that we have calculated the BAN

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.380
and we are negative.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.360
It is quite simple to understand that

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.440
if the BAN goes negative, lower than

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.860
zero, it is because the profitability

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.660
of this project, starting from

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.440
those cash flows, starting

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.060
from that investment, is less

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.280
than 20%.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.940
That is, we should not make this

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.340
investment, because we demand a minimum

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.620
of 20% for the risk that it has and

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.500
really the real profitability

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500
that we are getting, the TIR,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.350
which So in short, if the BAN

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.950
in the first of the cases is higher

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.690
than zero, if we have a positive

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.990
BAN, it is because the profitability

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.610
of that project, those

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.250
cash flows, that investment,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.730
is higher than the discount

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.150
rate, the minimum profitability

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.690
that we are demanding.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.110
That is, that TIR, the profitability,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.290
is higher here than the discount

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.150
rate.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.790
In the case of the medium in which

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.350
the BAN is equal to zero, in this case,

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.970
it is that the profitability we are

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.130
getting is just the one

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.150
we were demanding.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.490
The shooting is the same.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.390
And in the third of the cases where

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.470
the BAN is negative, it is because

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.550
the real profitability

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.230
of the project, given those

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.810
cash flows, that investment,

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.450
is less than the discount rate.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.860
Let's go deeper into the TIR,

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.580
which is the internal rate of

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.820
return, which we have named

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.680
before, but you may not yet understand

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.580
it, and in addition, I'm

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.100
aware that it's not easy.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.780
The TIR, really, the concept is simple

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.180
because it is the profitability of

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.660
the investment.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.260
What is not easy is to get to it,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.120
the formula.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.720
By the way, the TIR is an indicator

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.300
of profitability, therefore, it

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.880
is a percentage, unlike the BAN,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.680
which is an absolute value, which

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.040
are euros, dollars, etc.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.480
Let us remember how we calculated the

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.100
ban.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.680
The BAN is the present value or

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.060
current value of those flows

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.440
that will be generated, discounted

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.420
to the rate, to the rate of updating

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.600
that we require in accordance

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.040
with the risk.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.860
Well, the TIR, and this is something

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.740
you have to remember, is profitability

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.920
or it is the rate that makes

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.360
the BAN equal to zero.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.100
This may not be intuitive

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.780
to you.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.740
We will try to understand it better by looking

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.380
at the formula.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.820
We have the BAN formula in which

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.240
we have a series of cash flows,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.280
and what we say is that when

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.920
the BAN is equal to zero, we have

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.980
it there, the upgrade

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.640
rate is equal to the TIR.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.940
It may not be well understood

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.920
yet, but we will do one thing, we will

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.600
go to that investment, we will pass

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.940
the value of the investment

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.860
to the other side, and we have the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.920
formula of so.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.940
In this case, what we have is

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.100
that we make an investment,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.970
we will get a profit and cash

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.150
flows will be generated.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.230
It is easy to understand, but

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.550
in the end we used the same

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.290
formula.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.350
In this case, we see, the

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.710
investment we will make is exactly

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.410
the current value of a series of

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.790
cash flows that will be generated,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.850
discounted to the real

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.710
profitability of the project.
