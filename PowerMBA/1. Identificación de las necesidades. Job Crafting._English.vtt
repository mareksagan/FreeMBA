00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.580
The process of managing human capital

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.320
should start is that it is also

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.840
by pure common sense to identify

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.700
what you want or what you need

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.960
and then you will have to go

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.000
out to look for it, manage

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.020
it, develop it, etc.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600
But of course, if we haven’t done

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320
the first step well, what do we need?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.880
I understand that to the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.940
company’s strategic goals,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.680
etc.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.600
For all the rest, it is as if in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.840
marketing we have not defined our

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.800
target audience well, everything

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.720
else we do is wrong.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.580
So what I would like to analyze

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
is how the traditional process

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.960
is and what you propose

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.880
for the identification of needs,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.100
that is, what we are going

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.860
to look for.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Usually what is done in companies

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.040
traditionally, this management

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.640
do it the following way.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.360
You are generated a vacancy in the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.940
organization either because someone

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.100
has left the company or because

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.600
a new position has been created.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.640
Depending on that, you have to identify

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.380
well what you are going to go out to look for.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.940
And then that means doing what we call

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.480
the job description, which is basically

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.080
the name of the position, the position

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.440
he occupies in the organization,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.020
in what department he is, the type

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.080
of level of responsibilities and functions

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.320
that this person will finish,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.640
the goal and mission of that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.580
position and the relationships that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.280
these people will talk about, that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.540
is, whether he will carry teams,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120
whether he will have a very direct

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.220
relationship with the commercial

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.500
department or with the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380
financial or with external

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.980
suppliers and others.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.480
Once you clearly do that exercise

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.100
of reflection, of identifying

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.780
what you are looking for, logically

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.540
you will be much more agile

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.900
at finding it.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.040
In addition, it will help you look

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.320
better because you have clear what

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.860
you want, it is also common sense

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.240
and it will help you, if you have done

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.360
the exercise, to when you are with

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.620
the candidates, transmit it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.840
well because sometimes it happens

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300
that in interviews suddenly

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.200
it seems that you do not know or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.640
explain what you are going to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.960
do and the other person generates sincerity.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.800
Does it allow you to be much

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.180
more efficient when communicating

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.600
to candidates presenting so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.820
that they also buy it or not?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.520
Of course, that is it.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.540
Effectively be transparent and explain

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.980
point by point everything your

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.860
involvement or your work will

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.860
involve.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.280
How do you propose it?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.240
What is your approach?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.040
Well, we who are an

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920
adocratic organization,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.740
we have an adocratic culture,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.720
we propose to focus

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.380
more on people, which

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.800
each of us provides

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.840
in a differential way.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.540
I like to explain it with a formula

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.780
I have defined, which is world-

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.320
renowned, but for me what

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.500
I seek is talent.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.200
So what we need to do is

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
identify what is talent for us.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.840
In this case, for my company,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.980
talent is a set of knowledge

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.680
and skills and attitude.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520


00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.600
What are knowledge?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.000
Knowledge is what a person

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.720
needs to know to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.940
perform their job.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.140
That is, for example, if I’m looking

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.080
for a programmer, I need someone

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.080
who logically has programming

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.720
studies or experience

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.160
in programming.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040
What are the skills?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.640
This is a skill and one person

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.060
will have to develop in

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.960
their workplace.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.340
That is, if I am looking

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.280
for a commercial, he must have

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.140
very powerful negotiation and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.460
communication skills.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.060
That is the skills.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.460
Then there is the attitude.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.420
The attitude of people, each

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.260
person has an attitude toward

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.880
life, but we, for example, who

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.400
are an adocratic culture, look

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.320
for people who have an innovative,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.880
flexible attitude, who advance

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.320
changes, who are proactive,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.760
who have a continuous learning

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.820
ability that helps us to

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.320
overcome challenges in

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.640
an agile way.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.460
This is what we call an

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.360
adocratic attitude toward

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.320
life and work.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.620
So, we are what we are looking for.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.280
This is a very interesting topic because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.040
all entrepreneurs, when we want

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.080
to incorporate or replace people,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.160
we always see ourselves in the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.220
dilemmas.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.560
I would explain it this way.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.580
You often don’t know if

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.800
we incorporate someone with 10

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.520
years of experience or two, but

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.920
who has the high potential.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.660
What do you buy today, talent?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.260
What is the long term or longer

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.620
term?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.180
What am I looking for?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.720
That is something that is permanent.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.720
Anyone who has hired people is sure

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.640
that this happens to them.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.940
Especially in organizations like

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.720
ours or like yours, which are adocratic,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.540
flexible, innovative organizations

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.760
in which you are not replacing

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.740
one peer for another.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.240


00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.720
So what you said is that with

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.800
your talent formula equal to knowledge

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.420
more skills, knowledge and

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.540
skills are a little more associated

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.820
with that particular

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.620
position.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840
That is.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.320
The difference is attitude.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.900
It is different, but it is the

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.460
same for the whole organization.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.020
This is the attitude in the Power

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.420
Envie team or the attitude in

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.940
Pernod Ricard’s employees.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.280
All people should have the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.220
same attitude.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.340
These are the values of your company,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.980
which you have to be very clear

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.240
about.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.120
What am I looking for here?

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.320
We, for example, look for people

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.840
who are very proactive in the A-attitude.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.760
We are looking for people who

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.520
are micro-entrepreneurs, which we always say.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.900
actually is.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.640
I think that no matter

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.540
the traditional way to

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.680
make a job description, here

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.320
what you have to have very clear

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.560
is what is for us attitude.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360
Because knowledge and skills

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.620
is probably something more obvious.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.420
If you are going to dedicate yourself to

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.480
programming or selling or making a

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.240
marketing plan is something more obvious,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.080
that is not difficult, it does not require

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.740
much time.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.140
But, however, the attitude, as it

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.660
is linked to the culture of your

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.460
company, is very important that you

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.860
understand by attitude of Power MBA

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.340
or us at Pernod Ricard Spain.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.860
We have very clear that this

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.100
attitude must be innovative,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.600
startup, to go a step forward,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.560
continuous learning,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.420
overcoming and

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.940
also very experiential.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.220
We always say that we

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.820
don’t sell liquors, we

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.880
sell experiences.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.820
We need our employees to be

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.120
ambassadors of this attitude.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.840
We will give concrete advice

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.140
to Power MBA students, who

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.300
in many cases will face

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.980
or face the challenge

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.700
of hiring or managing teams.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.080
One concrete advice is that everything

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.220
is born of attitude.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.220
You have to identify what the values

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.400
of your company, your team and

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.080
everything starts there.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.460
That is.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.940
That is what will make the difference.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.120
You can have a fabulous programmer,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.320
but if his attitude is of the fallen

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.280
arms, more than the same, of

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.520
not leaving comfort missions,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.880
because maybe he is not the person

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.020
you want, because maybe he

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.440
has the knowledge of a Steve

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.440
Jobs, but probably he has

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.080
the attitude of a loser.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.420
And maybe that’s not what you

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.480
want, because when facing

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.240
the challenges of Power MBA or any

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.800
other company, the attitude is...

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.900
That’s why I love to highlight

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.140
that you add knowledge and

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.500
skills, but you multiply it by

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.980
attitude, because it’s what

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.120
will exponentially differentiate

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.780
your people and your company.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.960
So if you find someone who is excellent

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.220
in attitude and who shares your

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.240
values, even though knowledge,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.720
more skills, sume a little, as

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.600
what you are really weighing,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.800
is multiplying is attitude,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.780
you have to incorporate

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.100
it into the team and eventually

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.620
you will develop it.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.240
actually is.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.840
In fact, today’s and future

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.740
leaders are leaders who help

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.400
their teams develop

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.580
knowledge and skills, but

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.180
the attitude will be of

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.740
course.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.700
Just for that.
