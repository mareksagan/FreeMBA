WEBVTT

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.760
Gerardo, we will talk about project

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.240
management, which is a basic knowledge

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.840
area taught in all MBAs and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920
in addition, well, there are

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.460
a lot of courses and there are

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.280
a lot of people who are certified

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.720
and master in project management

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.560
and so on.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.240
First, I would like

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.300
you to explain what a project

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.080
is.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.620
The best way to explain what

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.800
a project is is to differentiate

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
it from a process.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.960
If you think about a process, it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780
something recurring, something

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.180
you do constantly and a project

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.480
is rather what you do once,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000
and I explain.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.360
Having a mounting chain where I

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.720
am pulling tun lathes is a process,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.780
making a tun lathes improvement

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.320
project is a project.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.620
While one is constant and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.060
concurrent, the other does what

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.100
it does is respond to a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920
specific goal and that is within

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.180
a certain date, etc.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.200
That is, in companies there are things

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.740
that we always do, that are processes

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.900
that change very little, that always

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.220
the same, that you have to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.180
look for efficiency

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.900
usually, the chain of mounting

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.420
of canes to tun, or whatever,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.700
in our case, do nur turin

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.480
of the lids.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.980
And one project would be to analyze how

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.500
we can improve the nur turin of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.800
the lids.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.920
Not to do so, but how we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.720
can analyze the main metrics,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.180
put in place, do AB testing, etc.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480
We know what it is and we understand what

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.940
a project is.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.260
What I want to make very clear here

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.540
is that project management is something

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.180
that is learned.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.200
You can learn from two

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.660
ways.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.100
The first is by personal experience,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.580
that is, you have done a number

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.700
of projects throughout your life,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.500
you have faced many problems

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
from which you learn and put

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.780
them into practice later, or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440
the simplest way is to learn

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.780
from the mistakes of others.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.020
And there are many places and the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.360
most respected, the Project Management

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.520
Institute, where they leave in clear,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.860
besides having very good certifications,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800
by the way, where they leave

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.440
very clear what the lines are,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.080
the good practices based on mistakes

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.980
that others have made so

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.100
that you go as a project manager.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.900
Let's say that combining

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.400
your experience, what you have done

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.560
in your context, and combining it with

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.700
good practices or otherwise is,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.720
let's say, the right formula to learn it.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.240
This is the project management

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.080
certification in the PMP.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.740
Tell us a little about how this works.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.960
Yes, at the Project Management

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.020
Institute you have the possibility

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.060
of, with certain requirements

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.540
met, so many hours of flight, etc.,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.860
you come to prepare an exam,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.940
a super extensive exam.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.960
In fact, to talk about this whole topic,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.640
it would be virtually another master.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.940
and already.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.640
And within that exam, they prepare

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040
you in 10 areas that they have identified

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.160
over time, which are 10 areas

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.760
that every project manager

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.920
should worry about.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.280
If you are going to start a project

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.520
tomorrow, there are 10 specific

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.420
areas you should worry about.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.140
You are certified in PMP.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.960
PMP is Project Management

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.780
Professional.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.860
What is this for you?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300
And it serves you, among other things,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.720
so that you can approach any project

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.260
with many more guarantees of success.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.580


00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.880
well is.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.660
Because you are knowledgeable about

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.060
all the techniques, tools,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.560
processes, methodologies, etc.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.320
And most of all because you'll learn

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.300
throughout the history of project

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.320
management, what others have done

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.440
and who have been successful and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.020
who haven't.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.400
The methodology is to analyze

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.880
cases.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.700
and yes.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.760
Analyze it.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.340
well is.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.060
You get an idea of the exam, it is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.340
a subject, it is a temary with a very

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.120
extensive theory, accompanied

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.260
often by practical cases.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.180
And then, because you do the exam

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.960
that is quite complicated,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.620
it's 6 hours, you can't get anything

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.960
out, etc.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.280
It has a fairly low approval

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.940
rate.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
Not everyone who approves it,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.200
but the first one who submits

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200
it, approves it.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.440
And what I want to explain with this is that

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.160
it is something very extensive, it has

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.380
a lot of branches.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.480
I want the students of Power

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.380
MBA to come out of the most important.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.820
well is.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.000
That's what I have to consider

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.260
if I want to start making a project

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.960
tomorrow.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.700
well is.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.180
And for me, these 10 areas that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820
PMP mentions, there are three

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.880
fundamental and are the management

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.100
of your reach, your cost and your time.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.660
It is the famous triple triangle

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.200
of restriction.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.220
Imagine a triangle, Borja,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.140
where you have the range,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.580
time and your costs above.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.980
Explain each one of

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.180
them in detail.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.860
The first thing that matters is

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.400
the scope.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.140
If you don't have a range and when

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.640
I speak of range I mean what you're

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.800
going to run, what you're going

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.120
to do, your final product.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.120
If you don't have that, there is no project.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.620
Unlike, as we said before, a continuous

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.560
process, here we have to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.920
have a lemotif, a specific goal.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.680
Give an example of a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.380
specific project.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.240
If you want to do it, you want

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.880
to make a website tomorrow, it's

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.420
a project.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.120
Apart from your operations you

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.760
don't die, if I want to make a

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.100
website with a landing page, for

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.140
example, that's a project for

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.760
you.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.540
And that has in advance that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.580
you define as the project manager,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.460
what the goals will be and how

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.820
far you will get with it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.520
Step by step, specify what will

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.320
be that website and even what will

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.900
not be.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.260
With that information, it is also important

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.540
to read it in advance and as complete

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.460
as possible.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.860
That is, in the scope we will

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.200
define absolutely everything we want

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.840
and the more detail the better,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.380
right?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.160
Not only better, but key.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.320
Because if you want me to budget

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.000
a project for you and you haven't

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.760
given me the secret,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.660
my estimates won't be the right ones.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.920
So, the better you give me,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.460
what will this website bring?

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.460
What information, how will it

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.840
be structured, what colors?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.780
What will it serve?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.900
Who will they be directed to, etc?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.260
The more detail, the better.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.740
And from that scope or that I'm

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.740
going to do, two big arches

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.360
derive.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.260
The first is how much it will

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.360
cost and how much time it will take.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.720
And these three, which is called the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.980
restrictive triangle, is important

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.000
to master it, because it influences

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.780
one with another.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.720
If you want a range or something

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.380
to be determined and you want it for

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.280
a given date, and I have to enable

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.400
more people to work, because

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.660
it will have more cost.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.200
If you want to reduce costs,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200
you may need to either remove

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.260
the scope or extend

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.380
the date.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.840
These three relationships are essential

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.220
for any project sector.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.740
It is then worth the methodology,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.300
which will help us with this data of

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.700
a range and with some restrictions,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.340
with definitions of time and cost,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.000
let's say that it is the most

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.860
efficient, etc.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.700
We're not going to get into

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.740
the methodology, because as we learn

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.720
from Scrum, in the end we're going

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.400
to learn how to manage projects.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.560
What are the main mistakes,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.120
regardless of whether it is a

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.700
traditional management?

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.140
What are the most common

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.220
mistakes in project

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.940
management?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.880
I think the first and main, which

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.900
most headwork causes, at the statistical

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.600
and other levels, is the failure

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.360
to properly manage stakeholders.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.720
When I say stakeholders,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.460
I mean all those involved

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.440
who have some interest

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.280
in your project.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.240
I will give you an example.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.200
You are taking out a product in the

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.700
telecommunications area, you have forgotten

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.780
to talk to a communications

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.280
manager, who when he learns that your

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.320
project will go out on the street,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.420
he tells you hears that you have

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.520
not taken into account my communications

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.860
issues and stops you.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.920
That is, we are talking about a big

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.100
company in which we launch a project

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.280
and there is another department with

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.600
which it has something to say in

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.680
our project, which are the communication

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.880
ones or whatever.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.240
We worked and so and so a day suddenly

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240
they come and tell us that this

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.120
is not possible.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.380
Either you're in a medium or small company,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.400
you've had a marketing campaign

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.000
to launch your product, it doesn't get

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.240
the product up to date, which is causing

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.200
you to get into trouble because

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.460
you've promised something you

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.720
won't get to fulfill.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.240
For me, identifying in advance,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.340
along with that scope we

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.920
are talking about, all the responsible

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.640
people we work on the State is

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.140
fundamental and is the source

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.080
of most mistakes.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.520
This looks, it's happening to me,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.200
stopers in this kind of things,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.640
lawyers, engineers, developers,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.880
because there are limitations

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.400
that don't, that is, we create

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.100
a project, we put a scope and

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.940
so it turns out that you can't,

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.180
I say lawyers because lawyers

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.500
say, it's that as you do

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.340
this you have a problem.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.280
I think, for example, my great

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.520
experience was more than...

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.700
Or the engineers, forgive me, they say,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.920
it is not possible to commit.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.480
In other words, the solution is not viable.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.600
This is not viable, it is not

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.620
technically viable.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.860
You have been working and it

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.640
cannot be done.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.440
This cannot be done and invalidates

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.740
the whole project, so one

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.120
advice you said is to take into

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.120
account all stakeholders, all

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.760
people who will have some

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.940
involvement.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.840
Yes, and keep in mind, not only

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.180
once, that some stakeholder

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.340
map I have it there and leave

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.720
it on the desk, but I have

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.920
it constantly monitored.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.020
The main recommendation is to create

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020
a map of stakeholders.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.520
and yes.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.760
well is.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.420
Keep it always open, open.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.280
That is, ask yourself, who are

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.440
the people who have any implication

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.280
and make a list?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.740
Yes, a second quite common mistake,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.000
and we talked about it a little earlier,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.800
is the management of the range.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.360
Everything that will enter the

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.180
project is important to have

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.960
it well identified in advance.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.420
Why is it?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.760
Because if I don't have it identified and

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.920
it's a very common mistake that

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.040
begins in a project without having it

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.220
well structured, what will be done?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.440
Thro the project...

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.680
What is being done and what is being achieved?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
Exactly, that throughout the

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.940
project, when it goes halfway, it

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.240
turns out that what is being

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.020
done is not what you wanted and

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.900
you get the project back on top.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.820
We need to make a new budget

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.840
because we need to make a new

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.740
budget.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.220
Getting more resources, and so on.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.940
Have very well defined requirements

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.500
on what and how, have them

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.760
negotiated and agreed between

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.180
all stakeholders and then

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.920
monitor them on another key factor.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.140
Well, very clearly

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.440
And last, and also a classic,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.800
are the risks management.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.200
I have seen during my experience

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.860
many project managers who have the

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.600
risks identified, but then they are

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.920
not above them and are not constantly

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.040
seeing them and they can happen

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.740
things like a banking law where

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.940
you have to touch data protection

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.620
and you are doing a project that

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.080
you have not taken into account,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.400
that a week before taking it

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.060
out you can not do it because

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.980
it is that already the law

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.040
is above you.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.080
Having clear what your risks are

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.300
from all points of view, political,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.980
economic, legal, internal of the

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.960
company and above all then monitor

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.500
them, see their probability occurrence

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.960
and have a plan to mitigate it

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.900
is another of the great classics

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.740
that is learned and that is

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.860
the most important.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.980
I will briefly summarize

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.600
the three.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.000
One, you have to take into account

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.640
all stakeholders, all people

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.640
who will have a certain...

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.820
Persons or groups of interest who

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.060
will have some implication in the

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.080
project, even if it is not direct.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.660
All you have to do is make

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.940
a list or a map.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.960
Two, make an effort to define the

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.700
range very well.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.860
Sometimes, and I say, sometimes it is laziness.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.180
It's like we're commissioning something

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.540
to someone and it gives you a lot of laziness

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.940
to make that initial effort to define

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.480
the scope.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.040
And that is ultimately a problem.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.880
This is also very typical, it is

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.380
true that it is very typical when you

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.340
order it to external suppliers,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.760
they usually require it from

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.560
you and they usually bother you when

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.220
they require it because I don't

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.600
want to devote so much time, what

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.080
I want is that you do it, but

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.140
in the bottom is a mistake.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.260
That is, what you need to do

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.740
is devote that initial time

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.900
to define the scope, the goals,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.040
the keys, such.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.400
Exactly, the more time

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.220
you invest in that phase,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.040
the less head odors you will have later.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.300
That that.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.100
Finally, you talk about the risk.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.460
There is also a need to start

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.820
identifying risks.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.240
This is what you need to prepare for, expect

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.820
the best, but prepare for the worst.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.320
And that's already true, because there

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.880
can be risks, threats that you haven't

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.940
taken into account and that then

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.900
arise and invalidate everything you've

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.220
done.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.100
They are the three big problems that

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.340
are usually found in that if you

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.380
work them and then combine it doing

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.980
a PMP or trained in that, because

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.280
you have all the guarantees of

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.060
success to be a great project

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.440
manager and manage projects.
