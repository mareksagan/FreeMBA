WEBVTT

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.290
Now that you already know

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.170
what inorganic growth

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.510
means and the differences with

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.630
organic growth, what we will

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.990
see are the different ways

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.950
or formulas that a company

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.550
has to grow in anorganic way.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.350
Inorganic growth is what we have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.970
on screen, it is the union between

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.970
two companies with one formula

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.510
or another, but it is the

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.310
union of a common goal.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.050
As I said, there are different

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.170
formulas and they are basically four.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.110
I don't want you to know the technical

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.250
details of each one, but you have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.150
to know a little about what the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.350
differences between each and what

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.270
they mean.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.710
A strategic partnership is an

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.270
agreement between two companies

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.330
that has a common goal.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.290
An adjunct is an agreement but

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.370
it also involves the creation of

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.090
a third company that controls the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.310
two companies.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.530
In a merger, the two companies are

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.190
merged and a new company

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.390
is created, and in the acquisition

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.070
one takes control of

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.550
the other.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.910
We will look at each one

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.430
with some more detail and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.530
with some examples.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630
And before I go on I think I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.850
want to make sure you know this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.350
term that is Mergers and Acquisitions

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.350
M & A.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.850
It is the English acronym for

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.110
mergers of acquisitions that is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.950
usually heard every day, so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.830
you should know it.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.790
Let's start with the acquisitions.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.070
What is an Acquisition?

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.490
An acquisition is a transaction

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.830
by which one company takes control

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.750
of another.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.130
What it does is buy the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.450
whole or part of the shares

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.210
but it always involves taking

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.050
control.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.050
Facebook bought WhatsApp.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.150
WhatsApp is part of the Facebook

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.350
group and is controlled

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.770
by WhatsApp.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.130
Microsoft is buying Skype.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.370
The same thing.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.270
Skype becomes a line of business

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.010
or part of the Microsoft Group.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.570
Fusion is a different operation

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.150
because in the merger what happens

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.690
is that a new company is born.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.090
We have two distinct companies

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.570
like Exxon and Mobile which

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.790
is the largest merger in

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.990
history, two US oil companies

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.490
that merge.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.470
And what is happening?

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350
The two companies disappear and a new

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.030
one is born.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.930
This is not as we have seen before

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.470
that one takes control of another, no.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.150
The two companies are merged.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.010
Kraft and Heinz, then the same, a new one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.010
is born, Kraft-Heinz is born.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.490
Let's see what a Genventor is.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.430
In the case of a Genventor,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.910
a new company is also created.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.830
The two companies are

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.390
not disappearing.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.590
Create between the two create

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.990
a new company that Genventor creates

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.450
for a specific goal, creates for

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.490
something.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.530
Now we will see.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.770
The newly-founded company is usually

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.530
born with a temporary period.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.950
Let us summarize.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270
Two different companies create a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.130
new company that they participate in.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.430
Both are involved in that new

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.270
company and that company has

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.390
a specific goal.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.090
For example, there are Genventor

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.850
who have a specific goal.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.830
If Inditex wants to enter the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.130
Australian market, it can do

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.730
so completely organically with

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.030
its resources, arrive in Australia,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.950
hire managers, hire

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.610
employees, launch new

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.390
stores, etc.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.990
Or what he can do is rely on an

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.450
Australian company, as he did,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.430
creating a Genventor that is a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.550
new company of which Inditex

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.290
participated at 80%, which makes

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.030
it very easy to enter Australia.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.810
Or the case of Fisher, which is a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.870
pharmaceutical laboratory.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.410
I wanted to enter China.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.690
China is a very complex market.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.750
Well, what he did is an agreement

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.090
with Hisun, a Chinese laboratory,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.490
to sell mainly generics in

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.810
the Chinese market.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.670
The two founded a new company

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.050
in which the two were involved

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.410
and that company was

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.410
located in China.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.430
There are also industrial inventions.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.950
What do I mean by industrial?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.890
I have inventions that are

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.830
aimed at producing together,

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.730
for example a new product, Sony

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.970
Ericsson, is well known, which

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.110
has already disappeared.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.390
Sony Ericsson was a Genventor in which,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.610
obviously, Sony and Ericsson, two

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.250
technology manufacturers, were

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.830
involved, aimed at manufacturing

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.950
a range of smartphones or creating

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.210
a range of smartphones, a new

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.470
brand of smartphones.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.850
What happens afterwards?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.310
Sony later bought

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.730
Ericsson for $1.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.450
5 trillion.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.490
This is common to think that two

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.210
companies come to an agreement with

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.470
a specific goal, a Genventor is produced

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.750
that is like the first, is

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.730
the first step and subsequently

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.170
because one of the two in many

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.870
cases acquires the other or buys

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.210
the other, right?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.750
And we go with the last of the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.950
formulas, with the formula that

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.510
requires less integration, here neither

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.590
are new societies created nor are

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.190
they merged or bought, which is an

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.570
agreement between two companies.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.200
A deal also aimed at specific

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.560
objectives, this is the same as Genventor,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.360
has a specific purpose, for example

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.740
that it can be commercial, Starbucks

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.280
within its international expansion

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.580
strategy is supported by

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.240
local companies such as

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.720
in the case of Spain, Vips, with

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.200
which it comes to strategic

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.780
alliances that generate certain

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.920
synergies and certain

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.960
benefits.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.100
It is easier if you are a US

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.760
company to grow supporting you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.840
in local partners like in this

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.700
case Vips, it is easier so that

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.680
you get to and do it with your

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.300
resources in countries you do not know.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.060
Barnes & Noble is a bookstore chain

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.740
in the United States and Barnes

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.000
& Noble wanted to incorporate within

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.980
their stores, they are very large,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.000
wanted to incorporate the coffee

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.260
shop service, which is what he did,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.100
came to an agreement, developed

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.220
a strategic alliance with Starbucks

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.280
by which Starbucks began

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.220
selling coffee within the Barnes

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.120
& Noble bookstores, creating

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.580
a joint product taking advantage

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.460
of a little of the brand

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.120
of the two.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.710
Look, this probably sounds like, if

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.250
you remember a few years ago the

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.530
phones, Nokia smartphones began

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.450
to incorporate the operating system

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.910
of Windows Phone and this was the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.950
fruit of a strategic alliance

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.110
between the two companies.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.910
Microsoft acquired

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.110
Nokia for 7.2 billion.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.330


00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.710
There are also alliances between

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.610
competitors, it is not very usual,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.030
it is less usual, it is easier

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.790
for an alliance between tables that

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.050
does not compete directly but sometimes

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.230
between competitors.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.530
In this case, for example, Toyota and

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.470
BMW became an alliance to manufacture

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.310
a super sports car.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.190
By the way, in many cases, competitors'

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.570
alliances are very difficult,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.770
but they generate a lot of

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.610
tension and do not go well.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.690
And finally, it is common that there are

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.610
strategic alliances between two companies

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.250
that have powerful brands and

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.490
that what they do is to generate

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.090
synergies between their brand and you

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.930
will understand it with examples.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.230
Nike and Apple, for example, two

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.490
very leading brands, would say that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.730
the most prestigious, the

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.450
most valued in their respective

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.750
sectors are in this case allied

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.890
with common services, common

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.750
products, etc.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.030
Another one that I thought

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.990
was good for was the adidas.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.970


00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.690
Goodyear is a tyre manufacturer

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.470
that puts its brand on the

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.350
floor of adidas shoes

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.550
by reinforcing

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.530
the positioning of quality

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.110
and value by adidas shoes.
