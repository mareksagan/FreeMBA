WEBVTT

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.120
We have created a formula that

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.240
is designed to help you create

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.160
products, services or business

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.200
models that are innovative, but

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000
to do so minimizing the risk.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.380
This is absolutely key.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.920
And how will we do it?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.880
Well, what we’re going to do

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.140
is guide you through the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.700
main stages or the key

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.200
factors that are determinants

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.640
of the success of failure.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.140
From identifying ideas, opportunities

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.940
or validating those ideas in

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.540
the market with a scientific

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.800
method, learn to define the messages

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.540
you will send to your customers

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.860
and this will determine whether

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.320
they buy you or not, have

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.020
very clear what your marketing

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.220
plan is, learn to address

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.200
investors if you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.880
need them, etc.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900
What kind of business models are we talking about?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.440
By the way, we are not talking about

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.640
digital models, we are talking

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.700
about models that are innovative

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.860
and we have to understand this

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.980
well because they have many implications.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.520
When you innovate, what happens is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.420
that the potential of what you’re

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.260
going to is much larger, but it’s

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.160
also the risk and that’s why

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.520
we have to minimize it.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
If you do copying others, you enter

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.220
a market doing the same,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.500
because well, you will need

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.260
more money, the potential

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.700
is less, you will gain some

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.380
market share, but that’s

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.320
not what we want.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.220
What we want to do is do different

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.800
things than others and that’s why

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.540
we need a method, we need a formula

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.040
that helps us minimize those

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.980
risks because, as I tell

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060
you, when you’re innovating

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.800
you face a lot more uncertainty.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.620
You don’t know what will happen.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.220
We cannot give for granted that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.620
we know how customers will react,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.800
if they will buy us, if they will

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.780
see value, we do not even have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.120
to give for granted that that

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.260
segment of customers we have chosen

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.580
is the right one.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.600
Therefore, we need a scientific

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
method that helps us validate

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.220
all hypotheses to minimize

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.780
the risk.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.140
The Power Launch Formula gives

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.400
answers to the problems of three

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.180
customer segments, entrepreneurs

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.160
who have not launched, entrepreneurs

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.920
who already have a project

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.060
in progress and entrepreneurs.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.640
We start with the first ones.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.100
There are millions of people who

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.140
have the dream of changing their

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.540
lives, of starting their own business.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.340
What happens is that the vast majority

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.940
are paralyzed by fear, the fear of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.900
failure, which is very important

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.760
and is that the risk can be minimized

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.220
very much, that to undertake,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.400
that to innovate is no longer

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.740
a matter of throwing a coin

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.300
into the air, it is not a matter

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.180
of chance, you even have to

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.640
be very innovative, it is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
not a matter of luck.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.420
What we have to do is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.320
apply a scientific method

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.900
that helps us minimize the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.820
risks you will take.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460
By the way, this could even

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.840
help you start validating

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.480
your business model idea hypotheses

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.800
without leaving your

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.420
job.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.000
The second of the segments are entrepreneurs

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.680
who have already created

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.100
a product, a service.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.680
In some cases, they have a company

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.980
running and with employees,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.880
but they have not reached

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.440
product market fit, that is, sales

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.580
have not yet shot, have not validated

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.000
that they have something very

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.260
potent in their hands and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.820
it costs them.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.180
What happens is that almost everyone,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.200
and if you are in this situation

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.380
I would like you to make

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.300
the diagnosis, you are concerned

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.960
about pushing that product, that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.920
is, you are concerned about

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.560
marketing, when really the problem

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.240
is not marketing, the problem

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.740
is that you still do not have a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.160
value proposal that fits the perception

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.680
with a segment of customers, because

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.220
when you have that I tell you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.080
that sales will be shot,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.780
you will reach product market

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.440
fit.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.120
So what do we have to do?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.900
You have to keep looking,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.460
keep learning.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.880
You have to evolve your

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.980
value proposition until you

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.500
have something really valid

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.300
that fits a customer segment.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.240
And finally we have entrepreneurs

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.620
who want to continue to innovate,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.120
want to differentiate from

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.060
the competition, want to have

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.480
a company that is more valuable,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.380
that is scalable, etc.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.840
In this case, the starting point

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.980
may be different from the previous

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.760
ones, but in the end the challenge

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.340
is the same, what we have to

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.720
do is be able to innovate, to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.060
create new products or new innovative

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.400
services, but minimizing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.760
the risks.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520
To create the formula we

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.700
have analyzed the success cases.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.580
As you know, we’ve had some

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.980
of the biggest success cases

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.280
of the last few years and we’

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.220
ve analyzed hundreds of failure

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.680
projects, in which we’

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.600
ve been able to identify what

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.900
mistakes everyone makes

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.600
and what mental barriers

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.980
we have to break or we have

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.160
to overcome.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.080
And from that analysis we have created

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.740
a formula in which we have incorporated

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.300
all the programs, that is, it is

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.320
a very complete program, there

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.860
is none in the market so, it

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.660
will help you throughout all the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.740
stages in the main decisions,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.560
the truly determinants of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.660
your current idea or the ideas

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.040
that you are going to emerge or

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.880
your current project end up

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.720
becoming a model of success, which,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.500
as I told you, are not in many

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.020
cases the ones that worry you.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.080
All you do is to make a business

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.700
plan or draw the business model

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.200
canvas or the value curve and that

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.820
is not worth anything because you

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.420
can put on the paper what you want,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.020
what we have to do is validate

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.240
absolutely all those hypotheses

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.340
that you have incorporated into

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.720
your business model and validate

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.720
it scientifically, because only

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.860
so we will be minimizing

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.560
the risk and only so we will be

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.720
every day closer to the goal

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.440
that is to have an innovative

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.960
and successful business model.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.520
The program consists of 50 classes

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.860
in visual format, but what you have

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.820
to keep in mind is that in this

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.880
case it is a very practical program

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440
that incorporates work sheets,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.740
that is, you will have to work it

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.000
yourself and you will work

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.080
with your current ideas, with your

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.060
current project or with the ideas

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.320
that are emerging, because we will

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.720
help you identify ideas, identify

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
opportunities, you

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.300
will be able to advance at your

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.180
pace, you really have to keep

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.460
in mind that this formula you

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.860
will apply whenever you want

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.500
with all the ideas that will

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.700
arise in the future, in addition

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.780
what we will do is we will

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.000
create the discussion

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.200
forums in which we will

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.560
encourage you all to

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.040
share your advances.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.700
To finish, I will share with

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.260
you a reflection that is

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.900
important and also leads many

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.860
people to failure.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.480
To succeed, to create an innovative

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.260
business model does not depend on the

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.560
idea, it does not depend on

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.440
having a happy idea, no.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.640
For many reasons, if you realize

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.380
that almost all ideas will have to

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.040
be modified a thousand times and

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.920
also realize that all the entrepreneurs

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.480
we have come to have success

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.980
have failed a thousand

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.360
times before.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.380
Therefore, what we have to do is

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.200
learn to validate very quickly

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.100
by investing the least time and

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.600
money possible all the ideas

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.980
that are emerging and in that

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.180
way what we will is to multiply

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.720
the options that at some point

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.360
one of those opportunities validate

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.060
that fits in a segment

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.880
of customers, validate that

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.820
fits you, with your moment,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.100
with your situation, with

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.460
your capabilities and all the

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.240
pieces of the puzzle will fit

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.260
and that day that idea will

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.460
be executed and will

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.800
become a successful business

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.720
model.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.120
Therefore, the recommendation is that

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.300
we start as we don’t block ourselves

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.520
waiting for the happy idea

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.280
to come to us.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.720
We will help you identify opportunities.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.240
There are thousands of opportunities.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.280
The key, as I told you, is to know how

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.860
to validate it quickly and how

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.360
to execute them, how to convert those

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.660
ideas into successful business models.
