00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.140
Thro the course of accounting,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.520
we will refer

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.800
to various tools.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.320
We will look at various books,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.920
various financial statements,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.140
etc.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.580
So what I want with this class

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.860
is that you acquire that introductory

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.680
view of all those tools and

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.700
how they relate to each

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.380
other, because I think that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100
later it will help you understand

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.640
the rest of the classes.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.480
Let us start with the process.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.940
Accountants record all movements

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.080
in the daily book.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700
As the name implies, this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.580
happens daily.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.500
This is the first place where information

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.840
and accounting seats

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.120
are collected.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.260
The structure is very simple.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.760
As you can see on the screen, they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.660
are filling line to line.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.320
The journal also follows a chronological

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.320
sequence.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.260
What is really noticed in the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.060
diary is the movement of each

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.260
of the accounting accounts.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.380
At the end of each period, all

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.600
the movements of the diary are transferred

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.220
to the accounts.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
The accounts have this structure.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.320
The account is, we can

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.520
say, the smallest record

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.160
unit in accounting.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.380
Or more individualized.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.660
And in each account are recorded

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.220
the movements related to that particular

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.180
concept.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.320
Banks, social capital, customers,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.900
suppliers, debts.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.620
There are indefinitely countless accounts.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
And each accounting plan in each country

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.380
determines the accounts that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.000
can be used.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.940
The accounts have this structure that

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.620
you see on the screen, in the form of T.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.280
Then we will see what he answers.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.960
Here we can see for example this,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.520
which is the bank account with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.860
different notes.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.310
with the final balance of the account.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.210
The total accounts are

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.130
collected in another book

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.510
called the major book.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.770
In this book we can see all the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.010
accounts and the balances of each

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.730
of the accounts.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.330
Well, if we really stayed here in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.710
the diary and in the major, accounting

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.330
would not be providing us

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.550
with much information.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.630
We could simply draw conclusions

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.970
from the daily movements that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
have been generated and the balances

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.970
in each account.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.690
But they would not be related to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.430
each other.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.290
That is why what is done

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.950
is to move all those balances

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.470
in an organized way to more structured

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.530
reports.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.630
And these reports are what is

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.690
known as financial statements or

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.650
in some cases known as accounting

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.670
statements.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.530
In some countries, the annual accounts

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.510
are also used.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.090
Its function is to convey how the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.410
company is from an economic or

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.350
financial or patrimonial point of view.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.730
What changes have occurred

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.770
between two periods?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.870
We could say that financial

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.450
statements are the summary

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.650
of all transactions that have

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.470
been made over a period of time.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.960
Financial statements

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.040
are diverse.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.340
But really a student or an MBA

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.640
at any business school

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.680
in the world has to know

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.660
and understand well

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.140
mainly three of them.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.480
The balance sheet shows

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.920
the financial position

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.420
of a company at a given

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.040
time.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.480
His assets, his debts and his assets

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.260
of everything.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.150
The state of results, as its

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.470
name implies, indicates the outcome

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.430
of the exercise.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.290
The difference between all income

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.590
and all expenses that have

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.450
occurred during the period.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.030
And finally, the treasury

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.290
state informs us of the balance

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.990
and movements produced in the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.110
treasury during that period.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.830
As we will see later on, the three

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.270
financial statements are related

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.870
to each other.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.970
Well, because we will make a look

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.690
at how all the tools relate

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.830
and how the process we have

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.650
seen is.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.610
We start.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.990
All movements are recorded in

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.910
the daily book.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.810
From the daily book these notes are

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.790
transmitted, those movements to the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.930
accounts.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.470
We have accounts, we have

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.430
balance sheet accounts

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.010
and accounts of the state

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.050
of results.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.970
And all that information is

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.050
contained, it is kept within the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.950
major book that informs us of the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.850
salaries and movements within

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.390
each of the accounts.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.570
Finally, we do the balance

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.170
sheet of the two types of

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.930
accounts to the financial

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.310
statements, such as the balance

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.210
sheet and the results.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.950
The state of treasury as we

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.130
will see is created from

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.930
the balance sheet and the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.850
state of results.
