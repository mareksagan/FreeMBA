00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.380
Today we will look at the case of Samplea.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.840
I think it’s a very, very, very

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.260
interesting case that you’ll like.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
It is very interesting because it is original.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.920
Part of an idea that Robert Bonade,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.140
who is its founder, has,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.880
will tell us.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.980
And from that idea he has been

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.880
able to create a spectacular

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.340
business model, with very

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.320
much potential.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.480
What we’re going to do is, we’ll

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.260
see part of the conversation we’

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.820
ve had with Robert and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.840
later I’ll do an analysis of the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.780
business model and the innovation

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.120
that Robert has created.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.060
By the way, this you have on

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.660
screen is a queue of people

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.980
waiting in a shopping center.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.620
They are making a queue to access

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.080
a sample machine.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.400
In a while you will understand

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.200
why.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.700
And well, to begin with, I would like

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.960
you to explain who you are, where you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.940
come from, what you have done, that

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.300
you will talk a little about your

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.360
trajectory, about Publifilms, about

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.700
Samplea, etc.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.360
Well, then thank you Borja

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.340
for inviting me to share a little

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.380
of our opinions from Samplea.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.580
I know you like the project,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.580
very much.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.160
You’ve always liked it, it’s the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.540
first minute you discovered Samplea.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.900
I studied in Barcelona, I studied

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.460
advertising, I came from the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.520
world of marketing.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.460
When I just studied in Barcelona,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.800
I came to Madrid, I was 25

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.700
and created Publifilms.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
It is a specialized agency in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.680
street marketing, mass sampling,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.380
promoters at the point of sale,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.540
all this world.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.380
What is Sampling?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.560
Sampling is the fact of giving

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.420
product testing to consumers with

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.860
the intention that the product

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.080
is sold.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.140
And that’s what brands are

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.620
doing today, year after

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.460
year, to boost their

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.980
sales.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.400
That is, brands hire Publifilms

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.540
to share thousands of free

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.040
samples of different

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.060
types, right?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.660
Robert, I think we already understand

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.180
what Publifilms is and it would

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.220
really be interesting if you told us

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.300
how Samplea is born.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.480
I think it’s born from your experience,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.780
from your experience.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.120
After seeing that at Publifilms

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.660
we have given 4 million annual samples

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020
of products like Pepsi, Johnson

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.460
& Johnson, different samples,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.460
especially those we have given for

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.580
Spain and Portugal, we wanted

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.680
to do somehow, in a new way, and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.380
somehow have the opinion of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.340
the consumer, digitize it,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.620
give the product in an innovative

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.840
way, not so much through the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.320
promoter, that we have been

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.680
doing the same for 40 years.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.960
The promoters are the people who share.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.380
That is, the promoter is the person

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.700
you find yourself in a Carrefour,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.160
for example, you enter a Carrefour

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.440
and see a tasting of a product,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.420
right?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.200
All that, which today is done

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.060
and works, because it is true

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.200
that it works, we wanted to do

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440
it in a totally new way and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.420
break the schemes.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.460
How did we do it?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.660
Well, I thought of a machine,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.500
a vending machine, where

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.480
the concept was not to pay.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.160
That is, that the user would download

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.800
a mobile application, which cost

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.720
a lot to develop, that through a mobile

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.860
application the user would register,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.400
approach the machine and without

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.760
touching the machine, the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.200
machine would detect the fall

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.880
of the product.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.760
The user picked up the product

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.120
and then we made a product test

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360
between 5 and 10 questions.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.980
Well, I’ll make a summary of

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.440
what you told us before we go on.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.820
You were, you were, you didn’t say

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.960
it but I think you were the king of

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.840
sampling in Spain, you distributed

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.740
millions and millions and millions of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.640
samples or samples and one day you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.960
decide that because instead of

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.220
delivering it to the promoters you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.180
don’t deliver a machine and then

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.960
you decide to connect to those brands

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680
that offer samples like Pepsi, for

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.840
example, with the millions of users.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.020
But you decide to connect them through

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.580
a machine that shares the free

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.680
sample and an application that

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.820
allows the user, say, to

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.280
give feedback on what he has

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.220
offered.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.040
That is, after the success of

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.140
the applications in Spain, we did

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.220
it, we started this project

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.660
four years ago, almost three and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.520
a half years ago we started it and

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.800
at that time the applications were

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.920
the boom, then we said we did

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.440
it through application.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.480
Then through the app we could

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.060
digitize that user and be

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.600
able to interact with him once

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.780
he has tried the product.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.700
That is, you will be able to interact

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.180
with the user not only through the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.320
machine, but later because you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.120
already have your application downloaded.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.990
To finish this first part, tell

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.510
us in big numbers what the sample

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.830
volume is, I don’t talk about billing,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.030
I talk about centers, how many

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.390
machines you have, in what

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.750
countries you are, how many

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.950
users you have.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.670
Now we have almost half

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.210
a million users, almost

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.230
480,000 people between Android

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.930
and Play Store.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.290
Then they are distributed between

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.630
Madrid and Barcelona, we have in the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.810
best shopping centers in Spain,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.350
we are in Chanadun, Baguadan,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.010
South Park.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.110
How many machines do you have?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.730
We have five now and we are

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.370
going to put one more now, we

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.450
are going to six.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.070
The best shopping centers in Spain

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.090
with the most traffic.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.410
That is, with more traffic.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.410
And at the international level?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.510
At the international level we start next

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.950
week, we start in Central America,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.170
in particular Guatemala, with

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.590
the intention of going to Panama,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.810
Mexico and more countries

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.390
with this order.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.950
And we started, we are already closing

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.210
Kubaid, Kubaid and the Persian Gulf.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.580
The majority of the consumer and

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.740
food companies, 80% of them, are

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.260
multinational consumers.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.860
We are growing in the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.760
fashion segment.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.800
Fashion segment can be Northwick,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.640
Sunshine, which we have already

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.040
done more or less a few campaigns

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.080
to boost the e-commerce that they

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.900
generate on their website.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.560
Well, I understand, they are very powerful brands.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.620
What do you offer them?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.400
What we offer is coverage.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.460
In 15 days of campaign that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.600
you will do with us, throughout

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.880
the wide machine circuit that

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.120
we have in the best shopping

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.260
centers in Spain, you will

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.060
know more than 3 million people,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.600
will know the brand visually.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.180


00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.720
Of those 3 million who will see the

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.980
brand, they will have that visual impact,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.660
we will give 40,000 people,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.840
they will have a direct impact and

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.180
they will have a sampling in their

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.220
hands of the product.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.620
So what we do is give to test

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.280
this product quickly, easily and

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.580
innovatively to those thousands

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.540
of people that is an important

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.760
segment.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.000
Well, what you are saying to me in

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.200
the bottom is the same value proposition.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.380


00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.400
What you have told me so far is the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
same value proposal as if you

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.260
do it with promoters.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.640
What you don’t know is that

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.180
you’re also giving them

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.420
a new value, which is feedback.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.800
Here is it.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.400
The promoter of promoters.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.380
Many times we have coincided in

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.920
campaigns of promoters stands in

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.220
front of the wide machines with

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.360
other brands and our wide machines

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.780
has much more power our wide

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.220
machines that has queues of people

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.740
with the mobile hoping

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.900
to take their sample than a simple

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.320
stand with promoters.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.740
So I think there is a case study

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.160
of saying why the user, even

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.620
if we have an impediment

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.900
to get the machine out, what gives

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.340
is more willing and prefers

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.320
the machine than to give

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.000
it in the hand.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.100
So clearly, I saw it clearly that

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.620
day.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.880
Well well perfect.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.980
And what I said, you also offer

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.420
these brands that hire you,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.800
that hire you a campaign inside

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.920
the machine, you offer them

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.680
feedback.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.720
That’s the important thing, that

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.460
the user tries the product and the

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.580
brand is very interested in the

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.960
opinions of those thousands

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.160
of people in a record time because

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.520
the user has to answer those

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.000
questions to be able to get

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.300
the next product from the

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.640
sample.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.740
I think there is another segment

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.480
of customers that you have to consider

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.640
in your business model that is what

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.520
you call users because you are

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.900
connecting to these brands with hundreds

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.900
of thousands of people who are

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.340
people who are running, waiting and

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.500
downloading your application

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.400
because even if you don’t cover

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.920
directly from them, it’s a

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.460
segment of customers because

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.200
you’re monetizing it somehow.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.940
So is it.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.480
What do you offer to users?

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.000
I offer users a free product

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.740
service all year through our

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.380
mobile app, with which they

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.920
do not delete the app, they become

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.600
addicted, they are freebies,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.760
we call them now, they

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.820
are crazy for free and they

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.700
are a very large community,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.440
they grow more and more,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.160
each user tells 15 people

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.820
and it is incredible the

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.680
growth we have.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.220
Today, we are the eighth lowest application

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.620
in Spain right now.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.080
First of all, the customer pays

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.400
us because we decorate the machine,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.020
we make logistics possible,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.480
that is, we make a campaign for it.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.720
The campaign is paid by campaign.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.940
We pay for the campaign.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.460
On the other hand, we also do push

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.720
notification campaigns, that is,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.580
once the user knows that he

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.600
has liked the product, we

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.480
send push notifications

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.780
with image to those mobile phones

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.680
to plug them in some other

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.780
way in which they try the

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.160
product.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.100
and perfect.
