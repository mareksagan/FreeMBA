WEBVTT

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.260
And now, to reinforce the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.300
concepts learned, to better

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.240
understand ROE, ROA and the formula,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.300
what we will do is look

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.140
at three examples.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.360
We'll compare three companies,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.500
two gyms and a consultant.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.520
First, to understand the analysis

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.220
well, keep in mind that in the three

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.660
cases we are going from the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.020
assumption that we get a beneficiary

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.760
of half a million euros.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.620
Start with the gym.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.320
The A gym is a capital-intensive

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.740
model and investment-intensive,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.900
because you have to buy

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.140
machinery, make a local reform,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.360
etc., and you have an asset

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.580
of one million euros, a non-

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.980
current asset.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.060
How did the A-Gym partner

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.860
finance?

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.220
How did you finance that million?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.020
It is a net property.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.180
There is no leverage here.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.840
Let us go to the formula.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.180
Let us calculate it.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.100
We want to calculate what is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.280
the profitability of the partners'

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.640
own funds.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.900
And we start by calculating the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.680
profitability of the asset, the ROA.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.080
And the ROA in this case, what is the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.840
net profit?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.700
Remember that we said that the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.360
net profit is half a million divided

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.240
by the total asset, which

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.100
is one million euros.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.500
So we have a ROA of 0.5.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.440
We have to multiply it, in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.940
this case, by leverage, but

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as we have seen, we have

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.060
funded the gym only with own

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.220
funds, therefore, there is

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.400
no multiplier.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.560
The multiplier is one.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.380
In this case, the ROE, the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.500
profitability of the equity is exactly

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.880
the same as the profitability

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.980
of the asset, because there has

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.040
been no multiplier.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980
Let's take the second example, which is

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.580
the B gym.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.860
It is a gym very similar to the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860
A-Gym.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
It has a million euros in assets,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.880
it is the investment.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.340
In this case, the partners have

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.800
decided to ask for half a million

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.980
euros of debt.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.780
So the financial structure

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.460
we see in the balance sheet,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.160
in the right block, what we see

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.660
is that half a million euros

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.660
is net asset, equity and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.800
the other half a million

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.400
is debt.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.360
And let's go to the formula and see

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.660
how this affects the ROE, the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.360
profitability of the partners who have

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.540
put half a million euros.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.060
Well, the first thing we start with

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.280
the profitability of the asset, which

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.440
is the same as in gym A, because it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.740
is the same asset and they get the same...

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.520
They are getting the same benefits.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.380
Half a million between one million

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200
of the active, a ROE of 0.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.100
5, as before.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.340
What happens is that here there

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.720
is a leverage effect, there is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.840
a multiplier effect and we can

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.240
calculate it in the formula.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.180
Look at how simple it is, it is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.980
the asset, which is one million euros,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.020
divided between equity, divided between

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.480
half a million, which is equal to 2.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.300
In this case, we have doubled the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.180
profitability of our own

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.360
funds, because instead of putting

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.740
a million euros, we have put half.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.760
It is very easy to understand that way.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.380
And finally, we come to a very different

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.120
model, which is a consultant.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.420
Unlike the gyms, which are more resource-

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.780
intensive, in this case the investment

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.820
is very low, the assets

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.800
are very small, because

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.200
you do not need almost

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.960
anything to start operating.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.820
Well, let's consider that the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.320
asset is 50,000 euros.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.580
The non-current asset, which could

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.880
be, I don't know, some computers,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.580
some real estate, etc.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.640
of 50,000 euros.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.900
And in this case we will consider that

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.200
there is no leverage, it is very little

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.080
money and we have put it to the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.460
partners.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.820
But we also have a net profit

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.920
of half a million, right?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.220
We will calculate the profitability

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.980
in this case.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.160
The profitability of the equity

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.360
is equal to the profitability of

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.180
the asset by the multiplier.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.800
Let us start with the end in this

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.100
case.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560
There is no multiplier, because there

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.280
has been no leverage.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.660
We have invested 50,000 euros with

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.640
our own funds.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.920
The difference here, with respect to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.440
gyms, is that the profitability

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.020
of the asset is much higher.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.220
Why is it?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.460
The investment is very small,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.260
it is 50,000 euros.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.900
We will calculate the road.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.370
A half million from 50,000 euros.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.170
We have a ROAD of 10, which is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.250
equal to ROE, to the profitability

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.230
of our own funds, because we have

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.910
not leveraged.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.930
If we had been pushed, it would

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.910
have been even bigger.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.850
As you can see here, we are seeing how

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.390
the different structure of one

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.550
model or another makes the profitability

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.810
increase enormously.
