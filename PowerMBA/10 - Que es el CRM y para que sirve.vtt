WEBVTT

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.430
Jaime, thank you very much.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.330
Many thanks to you.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.650
I am glad you are here with

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.350
us today.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.570
I think it will be very enriching

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.790
for Power MBA students.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.970
Let's talk about CRM and I'll

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.990
ask you a few simple questions.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.810
What is CRM?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.690
Well, CRM is first of all a

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.850
strategy, not a tool, not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.970
a piece of software as many

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.210
people think.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.990
It is a strategy that seeks

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.390
profitability in the company.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.050
In the end, any business wants to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.150
be profitable, the more profitable

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.830
the better.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.990
This is what this CRM strategy

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.330
will help.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.090
In the bottom, then we'll go looking

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.770
at how you'll get this profitability,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.850
but what you'll look for

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.590
is profitability.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.830
The ultimate goal is to increase

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.370
profitability.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.050
That is.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.050
How will he do it?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.530
We seek the best possible relationship

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.190
with customers and know the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.010
customer better.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090
This will be a double benefit.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.630
On the one hand, the company will know

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.610
the customer better, will be able

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130
to offer them better those products

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.390
that they have in their portfolio

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.170
and the customer will receive

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.210
a better customer experience.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.930
Both by the subject of personalization and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.650
by the subject of the offer that you will

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.470
receive in the bottom.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.950
Well, I think that it is clear to us

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.230
that the profitability goal allows

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.450
you to better manage the relationship

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.050
with the customer, adapt more

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.910
to their needs, the customer

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.350
experience is better, etc.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.550
This sounds very well.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.310
What we have to do now is contextualize

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.610
it in concrete uses because

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.910
it helps us a lot to understand

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.970
how companies like Philips,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.510
like you, use CRM.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.070
and perfect.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.170
We will do the following.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410
Let's see what the main

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.010
departments that use

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.250
CRM and why they use it.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.730
and perfect.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.250
Departments in general can be the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.950
entire company.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.990
The whole company can be involved

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.410
in What matters here is not the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.730
tool but the whole philosophy

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.390
and strategy.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.910
But when it comes to the tool,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.710
who is using it?

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.090
Let me give you three or four

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.590
examples that I think are the most practical.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.650
First of all, the address.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.790
Management uses this type of

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.270
systems to make decisions

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.090
based on data, not sensations.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.490
And also to have a 360-degree view

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.350
of what is happening in the company

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.850
and what is happening to the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.370
customer and how we will see

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.250
the customer from different

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.590
points of view.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.730
From financial, from legal, from

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.290
marketing, from sales.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.870
On the other hand, we have sales.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.870
What you will have there is all the history

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.430
of relationships that you have had

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.550
with the client that can be well projects

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.370
that are in progress, projects that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.450
are in the future, calls that I have

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.410
been able to make, emails that I have

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.530
been able to send, offers that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.970
I have been able to get to send

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.810
and that you have accepted or not with

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.890
that we will also be able to go analyzing

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.510
why they are already accepting

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.990
those offers or those projects

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.430
and why not and be able to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.190
make decisions.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.670
Per we find that the historical

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.870
price we have given that customer

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.190
is very high or that they are probably

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.070
winning our competition,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.590
they are winning us in price.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.070
We can adjust the decisions

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.110
and price we are giving

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.310
customers based on

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.450
all these data.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.070
There is a very operational use,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.230
very day-to-day, that the commercial

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.570
delegates that already have a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.050
name, have so many interactions,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.850
not only they have many interactions

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.010
with customers but also the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.390
rest of the organization that

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.210
you have a tool that allows

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.350
you to collect it,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.690
manage it, etc.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.950
Or if it is unmanageable.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.730
And I also think it is important

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.210
to see how far we want to get because

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.050
we can believe that the commercial

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.570
targets all the wise data and for

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.130
there but I think that maybe

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.590
it doesn't make sense, we have

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.310
to see what we're going to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.290
use them for.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.910
If really the only thing we want to know

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.590
is what kind of projects we are

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.510
working with customers, because

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.450
we're going to put just that, it's

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.130
not necessary to have the rest.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.590
So I think it is important to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.890
differentiate what granularity

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.210
we want to get based on what

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.290
data and what analytics

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.370
we will want to get out

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.970
later.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.190
I have seen in a tool that uses the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.750
commercial address to control

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.490
the daily activity of the trading

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.310
force because clear the obligation

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270
that they perceive it imposed

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.510
in many cases but good to register

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.990
your activity allows

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.870
the commercial direction

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.270
because that have controlled

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.950
just.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.350
At the bottom I think it's a reaction

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.630
and it's usually one of the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.390
entry barriers, this will be the

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.690
big brother you'll control everything

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.110
I do.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.050
It is true that these systems

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.070
make sense if someone feeds

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.570
them with data, there can be

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.750
automatic data entries especially

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.930
on the marketing side

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.270
but often they have to be

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.130
manual entries.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.370
What is important here is to

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.170
give the trade force a reason for

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.210
them to go, to see the benefit

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.810
that will be impacted

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.730
on them if they follow

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.810
these rules of the game.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.490
This is basically because

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.750
many students may not know because

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.250
in many cases the commercial

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.130
forces are somewhat reactive

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.750
to using this type of tools

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.750
because it can complicate them

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.230
a little, they can perceive

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.150
it with a little bit of a blow

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.170
in getting the information

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.910
because they perceive it

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.650
is a tool of control etc.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.710
I think they are those two, one will

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.270
take them maybe one day a week or

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.970
whatever time of operation from

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.170
being in the client on the street

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.210
and another will be controlling

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.270
everything I do and everything

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.110
I don't do.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.550
That as you said really this is a

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.150
misuse, that is, control is a misuse

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.730
but good I wanted to make it clear

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.270
because it is something that exists,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.490
that is, many companies

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.590
use it so it is worth it.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.330
We already know how to use

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.510
the address, it allows you

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.470
to make decisions based

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.630
on basically real data and

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.850
customer information

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.750
collected as well as that

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.810
360.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.690
How do sales use it?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.250
I would give now marketing,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.050
marketing I believe is always

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.790
the fundamental pillar of

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.990
any CRM strategy.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.710
In the bottom, what we will look for

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.410
is to better know the customer, see

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.310
what kind of campaigns we will

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.910
want to launch according to the

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.610
customers, that is, we will put the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.350
topic of segmentation that is one

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.590
of the fundamental pillars also

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.930
in the CRM that is to say in

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.550
accordance with all the attributes

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.730
of all the data we have in the system

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.650
what kind of segments we will

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.070
create when launching campaigns

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.850
and what kind of content we

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.010
will launch to customize that

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.970
message.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.890
With which all that interaction

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.270
with the customer can even

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.750
become automated as we can

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.310
talk later, it is some of

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.330
the uses that marketing does.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.790
Yes, it basically has a lot more

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.250
information and allows you to adapt

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.270
the proposals, campaigns, etc.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.690
That is.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.130
And the tool also allows you to automate

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.350
it which is a huge advantage.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.850
That is even can come if we see

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.110
these two topics together no marketing

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.210
and sales these two teams all

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.870
this information that has been

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.750
collected can even come to

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.450
for the whole part of research

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.610
and development and say what products

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.030
we need to take out, what is

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.190
what is me demanding from the

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.790
market and what effectively is

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.330
information that feeds within

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.930
the CRM marketing and sales

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.050
but that has to flow to other

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.410
departments that are

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.350
responsible for IMAX D,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.010
product, etc.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.090
That is for example.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.750
Another example is

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.910
customer care.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.690
Customer care is one of the

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.090
components that also has

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.030
say a direct customer relationship

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.850
can be if we mention two

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.490
can be customer care and

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.250
sales force.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.610
All this information is a direct

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.630
input from the customer and I think

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.990
it is very valuable.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.450
Sometimes they are complaints but

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.190
those complaints we also have to

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.250
know how to analyze them and know

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.370
why the customer is complaining.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.030
If it is for some internal process

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.290
that we have is for a faulty

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.890
product or why the customer

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.690
is complaining to try to fix it.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.470
When it comes to customer service, it

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.010
is important to have all this

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.430
information available and detailed.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.550
People who are on the phone know if there

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.310
is any commercial in contact with this

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.970
customer, what type of product

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.010
has been offered to him, if marketing

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.290
launches some type of campaign,

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.670
if that campaign is in place or

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.030
not, if the customer has probably

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.510
already called with some other

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.890
complaint, some other suggestion and

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.690
depending on all this the relationship

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.970
that people will have with the

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.510
customer can be totally

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.170
different.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.210
This is what you typically call

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.630
customer service to a company results

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.870
that they don't have your data

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.270
as much as it is that it can't be

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.870
and the CRM helps the solution to this.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.030
So I think we have suffered from

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.970
calling telephone companies for

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.250
bills or service cuts and

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.470
we have to tell the same story

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.190
a thousand times one after another.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.810


00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.910
This is what should solve this

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.030
type of systems, that when you

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.430
get a new people out your file

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.070
and say well I know what happens

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.730
to the story from this point I

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.090
do not have to go back and back

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.750
to the entire history.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.190
I will do a little look, you have talked

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.850
about four departments

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.130
although they are more, direction,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.550
the direction allows you to make

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.290
decisions, but then sales,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.690
marketing and customer service

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.110
especially sales and customer

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.610
service are the departments

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.390
that are most responsible

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.690
for incorporating information

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.770
within the CRM.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.410
They are the ones who have direct

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.970
contact with the customer.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.350
So somehow this is a flow of value

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.710
or information going and going is

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.150
the CRM allows us to get much

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.870
more information and richer

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.210
from our customers with the aim of

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.710
making it back, that is, that

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.750
the value come back because now

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.790
we know ourselves much better

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.670
and then marketing, customer

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.050
service and sales may not know

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.690
to return the value.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.350
This is very tangible

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.990
in the marketing world.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.790
When we put a form on the web we ask

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.850
the customer to fill it in we always

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.110
have to tell you why you have

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.290
to fill it is to say because

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.710
you will receive a newsletter

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.710
with our offers or you

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.330
will receive no know something

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.510
in return.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.310
This is the same way that

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.230
we are going to see in this type

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.770
of case and in the case of sales

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.170
it is a bit the same thing we have

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.150
talked about.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.470
We want you to give this data because

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.770
in return imagine when if you are a

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.430
commercial you are assigned a new customer

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.990
you do not have to start from

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.830
scratch to call the customer

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.230
hear who you are, who you are not,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.990
what you do, what we have done with you.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.970
You have all that history and you can

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.110
start from the work your previous

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.870
partner has done.
