WEBVTT

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.310
Today we will talk about a

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.790
tool that we are passionate about and

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.790
that we always recommend to all

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.090
companies that use it.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.050
It is Customer Journey Mapping, which

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.210
is the translation of mapping, we

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.210
will map the customer’s journey.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.570
And we love it because it has many

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.970
benefits, helps you better understand

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.750
your customers, helps you sell

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.230
more because you will optimize

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.030
the entire sales process or

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630
the conversion funnel, helps

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.950
you mainly to analyze what your

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.630
customer experience is and design

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.450
better experiences.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.130
Basically it helps you to have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.130
more satisfied customers that

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.190
is equal to a healthier business.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.670
We also love it because it is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.790
very simple and easy to use.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.730
Look, we propose this scheme, if you

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.790
search on the Internet you will

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.090
see numerous models of Customer

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.950
Journey Mapping, but well we

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.190
believe that with this information

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.630
is more than enough, you could

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.170
even make a simplification.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.950
The first step is to draw the customer’

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.950
s journey.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.430
In what consists this?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.530
It consists of putting yourself in

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.870
your client’s shoes, not yours,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.210
because the perspective can be different,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870
identifying how it is, what

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250
are all the contact points,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.810
touch points, that the client

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.090
lives with you.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.190
For visit your website, consult

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.250
information, talk to an agent, go

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.770
to a store, receive your product

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.030
through a messenger, I don’t know,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.470
fill in feedback in a survey,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.490
there are endless points of

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.550
contact.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.570
You must be the one who knows

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.250
your business best and you have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.670
to do one and what we will do

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.530
is analyze those contact points

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.330
and we propose a number of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.270
fields.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.110
In principle, what we have to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690
do is describe what the customer

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.270
is doing at each moment.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.810
Enter your website looking

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350
for information, or call you,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.310
or consult a brochure you sent

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250
him, or ask a friend.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.600
The next point is very important

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080
and is more difficult, and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.240
is to identify what the customer

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.520
wants, what the customer is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.340
really looking for at that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.760
point of contact.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.180
Here you have to get into your customer’

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.580
s mind, it’s a challenge but it’

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.240
s very valuable information, what

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.060
the customer wants.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.420
And the next thing we will do is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.340
to evaluate or analyze how that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.000
customer feels, whether the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.760
experience is being positive or

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.740
is being negative.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.560
But you already have more information

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.880
to analyze it because you already

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.880
know what it does, you already know

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.840
what it wants and it is easy to come

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.060
to the conclusion of whether at that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.320
point of contact the experience is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.720
being positive, negative or neutral.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.720
So far what we have done is describe

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.660
what it does, what it wants

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.860
and how the experience is.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.940
And we can also incorporate

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.040
a more internal perspective

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.720
on what we are doing and how

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.700
we can improve.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.260
And we propose that you identify

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.720
with who or what it has a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.400
relationship, and this is very broad,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.400
it can be with people, it can be

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.480
with systems, it can be with

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.520
the web, it can be with technology,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.800
if they are restaurants with food,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.200
etc., with who or what it has

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.400
a relationship, what is what

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.780
we are doing, how we are managing it.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.540
And finally, this field is very

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.720
convenient to incorporate, it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.660
is how we can improve from all

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.060
that analysis, how we can improve.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.860
The key to all this, I would

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.120
tell you, the keys are two.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.480
Customer Journey Mapping is

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.560
the customer’s journey, not

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.240
your journey.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.060
That is, you have to make the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.560
effort to really analyze it from

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.920
the perspective of your customers,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.980
because you have in mind that we

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.320
are all very contaminated usually

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.260
in the companies, we have created

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.960
products, we have designed

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.400
processes, etc., and it is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.220
easy that we forget what is

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.800
what customers are living.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.240
That is the key number one.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.060
The number two key is that you make

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.620
the effort and that you are able

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.680
to truly identify the journey,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.260
that you do a mapping, a mapping

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.220
of all, of all touch points.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.880
In addition, here it would be

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.100
interesting to identify, identify what

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.520
they call the moments of truth,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.380
which are those touch points that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.920
are truly critical.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.320
And I say it is and if you identify that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.520
there are one, two, three, x touch

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.880
points that are truly critical,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.900
because you should prioritize and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.940
implement improvements in those

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.520
touch points.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.420
They are basically touch points that

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.580
will determine whether the customer

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.360
buys you or not, whether the customer

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.300
is satisfied or not, etc. Basically.
