WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
We will talk about a very interesting

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.520
topic and it is the difference between

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.400
managing projects in a traditional way,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.460
that you would talk about PMP

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.120
before, etc., well, that PMP has evolved,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.960
but it is born in another environment,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.840
right?

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.800
and Agile.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.060
And I love it because understanding

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
Agile philosophy is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.840
absolutely key.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.660
It is very easy to understand.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.820
I will start by introducing it.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.740
There are areas where there is little uncertainty.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.640
What do I mean by this?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.040
You know, at the business level, but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.880
well, in general in life, do you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.180
know what's going to happen?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.340
Your affection is controlled.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080
Then all management, theory, literature,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.400
what we have learned throughout

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.580
the history of management

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.900
topics, what has been given

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.760
in universities, in

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.800
business schools, has been

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.640
born in this environment.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.220
Very little uncertainty.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.680
Why is?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.700
Because things changed more slowly,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.720
because the markets were those,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.100
mature markets where you know

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.040
what's going to happen, etc.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.340
For example, entering a market that

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.120
exists, copying competitors,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.580
are decisions of little

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.560
uncertainty.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.840
You know that if I mount

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.980
a restaurant in the Plaza de

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.660
la Moraleja, next to another

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.500
that works, I put a little more,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020
I put good quality and so, it will work.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.500
There is little uncertainty.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.140
well well.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.760
So when you face decisions with

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.880
little uncertainty, you can

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.000
manage the projects as you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.840
have told us.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.540
And now we go to the environment

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.260
of high uncertainty or uncertainty,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.640
when you innovate, when you don'

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.900
t know what is going to happen, when

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.380
you don't know how customers will react.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.740
This is increasingly greater.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
In other words, the environment of little

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.820
uncertainty is becoming less and less and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160
the environment of high uncertainty is becoming

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.840
more and more.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.580
Because the world is changing more and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.100
more quickly.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.680
So if what we do is apply what

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680
we have learned, traditional project

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100
management to environments

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.980
of high uncertainty,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.880
we fail a hundred percent.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.080
And that's why we need Linear

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.880
Startup, we need Jail, we

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.100
need this kind of things

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.820
to manage our company's strategy,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.440
not to give of course what

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440
customers want, to launch

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.280
new products to the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.120
market, to manage

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.820
projects.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.380
So today I would like you to explain

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.180
to us in the environments of high

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.400
uncertainty how projects are

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.660
managed under philosophy, what

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.020
are the main pillars of philosophy

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.840
to jail.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.900
Once we are in environments

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.920
of high uncertainty, as you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.180
said before, we can anticipate,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.640
etc., I think there are

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.760
four fundamental pillars

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760
on which we can start

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.640
to work on them.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.540
And the first and most important of

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.660
all is to recognize that there

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.040
can be no fixed reach.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.100
It is to admit that you don't know what

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.540
you are carrying.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.220
To say it in...

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.520
Or you don't know where you want to go...

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.400
It is like a linear startup.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.220
I start to make this, but as I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.160
think this is what I'm going to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.600
sell in the end, I'll find out.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.680
I have to keep my mind open and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.160
say, well, I'm seeing this today,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.540
but...

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.740
and exact.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.060
That is, from the basis that your

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.680
idea, however good it is, does not

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.520
stop being orientative, and all

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.140
along the way you will discover it.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.560
That is.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280
The first thing to know to manage

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.260
a project in Jail is to start

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.200
from the fact that we don'

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.420
t know in advance what we're going

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.860
to find.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.720
And for that I would like to rescue

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.760
the triangle we talked about before,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.860
the triple restriction triangle,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.580
in which first was the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.680
fixed range and then the variable

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.860
costs and time.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.500
Now it is the reverse.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.960
We now fix the costs and let the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.500
range be variable.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.460
Another key pillar I would like

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460
to comment on is the pillar of

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.020
prioritization.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.160
That is, there was the mentality

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.220
that, as I knew everything in advance,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.260
I wanted to approach the whole

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.480
project as if I wanted to recommend

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.600
an entire elephant.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.260
Not here though.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.840
Here is what...

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.780
This is the business plan.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.960
The business plan for a lifetime.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.400
You build a company, you have an idea

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.340
and so, I'm going to revolutionize the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.320
world and I'm making a business plan

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.720
and the project will happen in 5 years.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.340
The cash flow is 5 years.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.620
That is ridiculous.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.460
and exact.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.680
It is not ridiculous, it is a lie.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.980
That is, it is a lie.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.040
The chances that your business plan will

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.340
be fulfilled in 5 years are as high as

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.240
the chance that you will reach the million

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.880
euro.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.340
and exact.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.200
More or less, right?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860
Use the colour and so on.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.000
The collation of that is to be

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.980
proposed, he says, not only part of

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.160
the idea that you don't know what you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.500
want in advance, the scope is not fixed,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.380
but that also puts a focus on which

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.560
I have to consider that is fixed

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.940
in the upcoming cycles that

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.720
they call yesterday.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.080
and yes.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.840
You are doing a small cycle.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.680
Instead of turning an elephant

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.280
into a big cycle, you do small

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.900
cycles to go measuring your startup

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.220
line-type hypothesis and corroborating it.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.460
So I focus.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.180
We need to know every day

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.320
what we prioritize.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.840
What is most important now?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.780
Because, of course, that's all this

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.380
is very important to understand.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.900
If you have a business plan for five

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.960
years, well, it's like eating an

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.580
entire elephant.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.020
and yes.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.200
But when you say no, there is no business

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.320
plan for five years.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.300
I don't know what will happen.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.540
All I have to do is know how

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.160
to create more value today,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.640
tomorrow, or this week.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.820
and permanent focus.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.800
Constantly reflecting.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.540
Look at the impact.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.500
Only of these two we have mentioned

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.240
so far, of variable scope, recognizing

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.860
it, and focus makes you consider

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.720
a very interesting derivative.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.960
A traditional company asks

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.120
itself every day how cheap

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.320
it costs.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.820
A company that works with

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.000
found methods asks itself what

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
is the next thing I can do that

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.720
adds value.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.100
and yes.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.440
This is essential for your adaptive

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.300
strategy.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.980
So, besides having a range that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.340
you recognize that you don't know

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.640
where you're going in advance, besides

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.000
focusing on the most important

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.340
thing always first, you have

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.380
a third that is working in

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.340
cycles.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.840
If I used to plan a year to solve

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.620
a project and after a year

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.000
I had my solution, now you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.100
have to, as you said well

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.860
before, piss it in pieces.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.740
The elephant is it, right?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.540
Eating an elephant.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.100
We ate it, and today we eat it.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.840
And it is already.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.680
Today I am focused on this.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.120
I forget it.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.820
The mass is that you are bitter.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.480
Because if you eat a little

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.160
good, but as if you are thinking

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.540
you have to eat everything, it

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.300
is like you get upset.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.720
The projects have stopped...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.640


00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.600
I'm going to do a plan, we'll see in three

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.520
months and see what's going on.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.100
Every week, every fifteen days,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.480
every short cycle, as short as

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.360
possible, I am monitoring as to

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.420
my project and I am seeing if

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.480
it is effectively being met with

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.180
my goals.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.420
I want this to be applicable

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.620
to people.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.360
For example, we have meetings

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.280
every x time with the different

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.200
teams in which initiatives come out.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.800
So, usually what is done is that

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.500
many initiatives come

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.540
out and everyone goes with

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.900
many duties.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.980
Every day you check it out and nothing

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.580
has been done.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.020
That's what it has always been, isn't it?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.500
The typical.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.260
So, this philosophy of sprints

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.080
or focus, what it is, what

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.460
helps us is to...

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.200
No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.340
Not many initiatives.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.020
Not many initiatives in a year,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.420
no, no, no.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.240
In the next three days, do

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.060
this.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.940
Today we do this.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.040
And even like that, we all sit

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.700
down and do the same, but

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.460
in a sprint.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.260
It is very well...

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.020
Concentrate all your effort.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.360
In that sprint with a business goal,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.860
of course.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.100
Everything else is outside.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.340
That's not the same thing to be thinking,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.680
it's that in five years I'll

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680
do this business plan, but that

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.120
for the week to come I have

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.220
this goal and I have to focus.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.880
And only that.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.220
And only that.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.880
And focus all your workforce

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.020
to it.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.660
And that has fundamental changes, then,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.980
in the positive consequences

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.640
it gives.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.280
Change the whole way of organizing

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.380
work, because it was like it came,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.140
for you are in charge of this, this

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.320
and this, you are in charge of this,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.000
this and this.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.280
In the end, nobody does anything.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.300
And often you didn't even

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.960
know why.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.100
You have not done any activity,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.360
but I don't know what the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.880
goal is.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.540
Here you are quite clear that

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.740
what I'm going to do has this

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.300
linked business goal.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.040
That is.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.480
And your goal, until it ends, that

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.240
sprint, you just think about that.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.680
And it is linked with the fourth

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.240
pillar, which apart from the variable

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.940
range, apart from focusing on what

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.900
I do, apart from going in short

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.060
cycles, is that I will be very

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.420
close to the end customer, the

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.960
end user.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.200
The fact of allowing me to make

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.200
short cycles, to be focused and to know

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.040
that everything is variable, makes

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.740
me come very close to the client.
