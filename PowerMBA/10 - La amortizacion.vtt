00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.100
Amortisation is a very important

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.400
accounting and financial concept,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.860
but I have checked many times is

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.700
not well understood because it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.900
is not well explained.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.240
I wanted to dedicate a whole

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.840
class to this concept.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.050
The first thing we have to do is

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.750
understand very well what amortisation

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.430
is, what is the logic, and then

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.890
what we will see is how it is calculated

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.610
and how we will use

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.770
it accounting.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.510
I want you to understand why it is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030
amortised.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.870
Think that or almost all companies

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.030
have fixed assets in their

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.230
balance sheet, such as a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.630
vehicle, which each year

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.270
is losing value.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.450
Assets have a useful life and at the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.110
end of their useful life would be unusable.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.710
Well, because amortization is the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.270
mechanism we use for all years

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.070
to assign a accounting expenditure

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.910
that goes depreciating in our

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.790
balance sheet that asset.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.170
In this case, in the example we

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.570
are seeing, we will amortise the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.890
vehicle in 5 years.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230
It is a vehicle that we initially

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.590
have accounted for because it has

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.970
a value of 50,000 euros.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.030
What is what we do?

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.610
Every year we pay 10,000 euros

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.170
in the results account, in the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.730
results state, because we assign

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.070
that accounting expenditure.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.930
We are looking at the results,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.370
we are paying 10,000 euros

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.270
a year.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.610
We are amortising this asset.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.050
In addition, as the asset, in this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.570
case the car, is losing value every

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.350
year, we have to reflect it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.990
also in the balance of situation

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.590
on the part of the asset.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.830
And what we do is use an account

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.750
called cumulative amortisation

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.430
in which we accumulate,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.930
as we see, 10,000, 20.000,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.930
30.000, 40,000, we accumulate

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.290
depreciation.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.130
And we can see it in the situation

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.530
balance that originally in the year

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.430
0 we have a vehicle whose net

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.790
accounting value is 50,000 euros.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.490
As years pass, year 1, year 2, year

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.870
3, we will be reducing that cumulative

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.190
amortisation and the net value

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.930
of the asset will decrease

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.350
until at the end of its useful

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.770
life will be 0.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.950
There is one very important thing

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.930
you have to consider

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.230
regarding amortizations.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.930
And it is that amortizations are a accounting

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.670
expenditure, yes, but they have

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.170
no effect on the treasury.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.090
Usually the expenses lead to

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.450
a treasury exit.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.610
You buy something, you pay it and it has

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.530
an effect on the box.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.290
But not the amortisation.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.810
As we have seen, this vehicle

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.010
has been depreciating every year

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.530
and we have, as we can see, in the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.870
state of treasury we have taken

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.630
into account.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.910
We account for it as a cost.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.390
But really something comes out of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.150
the company's box.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.870
Do we pay for it every year?

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.650
No to.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.430
Amortisation, as we have seen, has

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.690
no effect on treasury and does not

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.950
respond to any actual or objective fact.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.210
This is a accounting expenditure.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.510
And as such, it affects

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.290
the profits we report and the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.090
taxes to pay.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.050
As we have seen above, the general

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.810
accounting plans of each country

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.410
recommend or determine the time limits

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.110
within which you can amortise

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.070
an asset.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.470
In this case, for example, we

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.630
have part of the table of amortisation

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.530
coefficients in the Spanish

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.990
General Accounting Plan.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.490
What I am going to do is that accountants

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.870
have a certain margin, some

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.070
freedom to play with the depreciation

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.710
and depreciation part and influence

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.110
gross profit and therefore

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.450
taxes and the outcome

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.630
of the exercise.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.590
And how?

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.630
If your goal is

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.990
to pay less, what

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.770
do you do?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.370
Do you increase the amortisation

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.330
rate by advancing the amortisations

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.930
in a specific period?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.610
Therefore, if you spend more, the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.890
gross profit is lower and the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.070
tax payments you pay that year

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.150
will be lower.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.550
Are you interested in the opposite?

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.010
What do you want is to report a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.010
result of exercising a greater

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.630
profit?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.150
Well, we do exactly the opposite.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.350
We amortise assets in a longer

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.710
term, say we delay the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.670
amortisation, we give a lower expenditure

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.050
and thus a higher income.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.720
Let us take an example with two

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.400
companies.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.740
In both cases, the company has an

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.900
asset valued at 50,000 euros.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.060
In the case of the company, in the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.340
first case, we will amortise the property

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.240
in two years.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.060
The annual expenditure

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.620
is 25,000 euros.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.460
If you have a life of 40,000, you will

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.640
have a 25 and you will have

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.580
a gross profit of 15.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.260
So, you pay the corporate

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.140
tax of 3,000.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.300
In the second scenario, it is the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.580
same asset, which happens that instead

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.840
of amortizing the good in two years

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.580
we will amortize it in 10.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.560
The amount of money we spend

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.660
is less than 5,000.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.300
We make the same rest, $40,000

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.220
minus an annual amortisation

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.580
of 5,000 we have a gross

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.240
profit of 35.000, which as we

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.260
see is much higher than the other

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.020
scenario.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.740
Of course, being a greater gross profit

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.360
we will pay more taxes and the outcome

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.980
of the exercise will be greater.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.460
As you can see, there is a certain

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.500
margin or flexibility to play with

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.160
the amortisations and to influence

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.380
on magnitudes that are very

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.940
important, such as taxes or as

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.400
the outcome of the exercise.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.160
To finish, and as we have

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.840
already mentioned other

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.200
times, an MBA student has to be

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.540
an expert in the global business

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.180
world.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.380
You cannot be an expert in

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.920
your country.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.560
Therefore, you must have at

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.980
least a basic knowledge of

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.280
how terms are used in different

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.460
parts of the world.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.080
And I want you to know that

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.720
in the U.S. accounting regulations

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.460
the concepts of amortization

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.440
and depreciation are used

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.460
in some slightly different way.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.560
The philosophy underlying is exactly

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.080
what we have explained.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.600
Amortisation is used for intangible

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.700
assets and depreciation

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.480
is used for tangible

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.240
assets.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.080
While we in today's class

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.700
have only used the term

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.640
amortisation but that

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.200
is used for both intangible

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.740
assets and tangible

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.600
assets.
