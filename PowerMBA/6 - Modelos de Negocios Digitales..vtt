WEBVTT

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.000
I would like you to be gaining a

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.440
very deep knowledge of business

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.920
models in the digital world, and

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.680
what we're going to do today

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.240
is to analyze a number of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.580
common patterns.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.620
There are companies, for example, like

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.360
Amazon, that combine many of the patterns

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.840
we're going to see today, right?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.220
But each pattern has a particular

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.440
characteristic, and has

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.100
a particular functioning.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.760
That is, as I said in the first

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.080
class, the pieces fit in a coherent

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.960
way, right? in each pattern.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.200
Let's start with something you already

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.760
know, which is e-commerce.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.960
E-commerce was the first business

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280
model that was born on the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.900
Internet.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.580
After all, e-commerce, so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.560
you understand, a pure

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.240
e-commerce is a store.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.080
What happens is that it is a store

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.060
that, instead of selling through the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.100
physical distribution channel,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.640
sells through the website.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.520
And within e-commerce we can englobate

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.700
from the web page through which

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
Zara sells, for example, or e-

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680
commerce that are pure e-commerce,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.100
as can Zappos, which is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
an e-commerce that Amazon

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.800
acquired.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.960
An online supermarket is an e-commerce.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.340
If we analyze the business

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.460
model, we see that it has the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.820
same characteristics as a store,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.400
that a retailer.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.440
And it is that it has to stock, it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.820
has to buy, and in addition

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.140
to its costs it has a variable cost

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.940
for the goods sold, right?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.660
This is very simple.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.000
Let us now look at what a marketplace

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.820
is.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.480
By the way, regarding the business

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.820
model of platform, marketplace,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.240
etc., we will devote many

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.360
classes to it.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.400
We will take a whole

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.560
course later.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.920
Well, I will move it forward.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.580
Unlike an e-commerce, an e-commerce

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.180
is a store, a marketplace

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.360
is a marketplace.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.300
In a marketplace, supply and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.920
demand are connected.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.740
We have a marketplace for products,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.120
as can be, for example, the case

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.400
of the super.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.740
For example, if we compare an online

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.040
supermarket, as we talked

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.880
before, it is an e-commerce

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520
with the supermarket.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.040
Del super is a platform that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.760
connects supermarkets with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.900
buyers, right?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.980
Therefore, in the business model

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.020
this has many repercussions

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.280
because you do not have to stock,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.240
you do not have to buy, and it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.580
does not have variable costs

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060
as we have seen from the goods sold.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.540
This is a product marketplace.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.340
You buy and sell a product.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.420
There are marketplaces where

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820
the exchange is services.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.160
There is supply and demand, but it is service.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
Services are shared, such as Airbnb,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.080
which is accommodation services,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.600
or Booking, for example, in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.740
which they are hotel reservations,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.380
right?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.300
and services.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940
And I want to talk about another model

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.620
that is growing very much, especially

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.640
it is being given in companies

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.260
like Amazon or Zalando, which I

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.580
have called IPA.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.860
Instead of a marketplace, which is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.180
a market, this would be a hypermarket.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.800
Why is it?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.040
Because there is a fact

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.060
that there are companies

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.860
that are growing huge.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.060
Amazon is the clearest example of all.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.340
Diversifying in all types

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.320
of products, services, etc.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440
So, they have already overtaken the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.480
concept of the marketplace.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.980
They are entering absolutely everything.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.480
And the strategy of hyper companies like

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.540
Amazon or Zalando is to bar the competition

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.020
from where they come in.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.620
Why is it?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.620
They have a scale economy.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.920
They have a scale economy, a huge

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.740
strength by the millions and millions

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.200
of people in the world who are

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200
customers, who are able to enter,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.960
diversify and enter any

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.840
type of business and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.320
bar the competition within

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.220
that business.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.740
I didn't want to put it

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.840
in the marketplaces.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.000
I think it is something else.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.980
And I think it's something we don't know

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.800
where it will take.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.860
It has an impact in

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.100
many sectors.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.120
Think of Amazon.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.140
The millions of users you have.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.140
Everyone has paid with cards,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.400
they are used to buying.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.260
There are people who buy, I buy,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.240
I don't put you every day, but

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.560
almost every day on Amazon.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.640
If Amazon diversifies and offers me

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.820
something more, it's that it's so easy

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.200
that I start buying that category

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.000
within Amazon.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.680
This is causing great damage

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.820
in many sectors.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.020
I don't judge it, but it is the reality.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.810
There are many companies that

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.350
offer a free service, free of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.950
charge, to all their customers,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.150
to all their users.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.490
Facebook and Google.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.630
Have you ever wondered how they

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.090
make money?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.550
It's pretty easy to be how they make

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.950
money, but well, let's analyze it.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.370
This model can be called a free

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.010
model.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.310
Or we might call it a advertising

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.050
model.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.330
And what consists?

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.150
It consists of, thanks to offering

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.790
a free service, in the case of Facebook,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.870
what they offer you is a social network

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.970
in which you connect with

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.550
people.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.390
In the case of Google, it is a search engine.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.210
Regardless of what they are offering

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.750
you, the fact is that you access

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.310
a value they provide you for free.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.330
And that allows them to capture

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.690
millions and millions of people around

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.470
the world.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.930
And what they do is monetize those

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.670
millions of people, that huge critical

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.010
mass through advertisers.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.050
This can be called a advertising model.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.330
You have to remember that this is

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.430
the key, really, of these free models.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.870
They have a lot of information.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.010
There are two factors, right?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.350
A lot of data from each

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.090
user.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.190
And they also have the fact that

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.690
the user spends a lot of time

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.430
inside the application, the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.430
website, etc.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.710
They have what is called user

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.930
attention, data and attention.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.290
These two values are sold to advertising

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.110
companies in different formats.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.890
But that's what they get to monetize,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.290
data and attention.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.370
In the end, they have advertising revenues.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.030
Advertisers pay Facebook,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.470
Google, there are so many examples,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.350
right?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.630
Therefore, we have users, end users,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.670
that we are all users, that

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.670
we access for free, something that

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.910
does not support in value.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.850
And there are others behind, the customers

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.230
really, who are the ones who pay,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.510
who are advertisers, right?

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.990
In addition to the free model, there

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.910
are companies that opt for a freemium

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.530
model, which is, in addition to attracting

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.390
users with a free proposal,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.110
what they offer is a service

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.490
of higher added value, which

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.590
you pay.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.330
For example, Skype, Spotify, we'll

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.710
see it in more detail, we've already

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.290
seen it.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.810
In this case, we have, like in

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.650
the free model, we have millions

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.450
of users, the key is to capture

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.870
millions of people, but we do

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.370
not monetize them directly

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.210
with advertising, we do not monetize

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.950
them from the data that we leave

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.410
and the time that passes, but

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.930
we monetize them because

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.850
there is a percentage

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.890
of soils that pay a quota.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.610
Is it worth?

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.910
Let us now talk about the business

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.490
model, the subscription

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.930
pattern, which we had already

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.990
seen when we talked about revenue flows.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.190
Subscription is growing a lot.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.330
Netflix is a common case, but look,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.290
it's what you're watching, they're

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.590
incorporating subscription

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.070
offers of all kinds of things.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.990
You wear shaves, for example,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.790
pay a monthly fee and

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.970
get knives to shave.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.810
Or pants of everything.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.070
Complements for men, for women,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.970
of all kinds.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.690
There are subscriptions of all kinds.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.430
And why?

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.290
What is what happens?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.050
Well, what happens is that an

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.690
important concept, a concept I

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.650
want you to learn is that the customer

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.390
lifetime value, the value that

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.330
the company gets from customers

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.530
with subscription accounts,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.170
usually throughout the

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.770
customer's life is higher.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.690
In the end, the customer is more

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.950
profitable.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.130
Not only that, but there is

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.770
a very important component

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.750
of security, recurrence of income.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.830
Afeitas, the case that put you, if

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.650
I sold knives and spare parts,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.390
would have less stable sales,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.910
but subscription allows you to

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.730
have a recurrent income

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.610
that is very valued, very

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.230
safe.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.330
Look, now I'm going to talk about

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.690
a pattern, a trend that is being

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.990
given in the business model of many

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.290
companies, like Amazon for example,

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.490
I think it's the most important

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.790
case, which I have called

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.730
the pyramid.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.770
And this, if you go

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.870
to a ranking, to any

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.830
ranking of digital business

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.010
models you won't find

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.050
it, but I think it's a

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.650
trend that is growing a lot.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.470
I explain it to you.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.850
This is related to the distribution

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.670
channel.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.090
Companies all their lives, their

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.390
distribution channels, have

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.730
relied on distributors or on

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.730
internal sales force.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.190
That was the way to sell.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.010
Well, companies like Amazon or for

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.430
example like MyProtein, sports supplement

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.690
companies, of many types, what

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.770
they create is an affiliate program

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.890
of partners to which anyone, almost

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.750
anyone, can subscribe,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.430
whether you have a website, a

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.930
blog, whatever, an application

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.110
or a group on Telegram in which

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.910
you have a lot of followers,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.390
you subscribe and you

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.430
what you do is to promote

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.290
certain products from

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.050
Amazon or MyProtein for example

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.470
and earn money with it.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.150
What are these companies achieving

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.550
with their partnerships?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.290
Well, what they can do is have a super-

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.710
potent distribution channel with very

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.450
large capillaries that doesn't cost them

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.210
anything, doesn't cost them to manage

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.610
it, doesn't cost them to look for

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.250
it, capture it, form it, create

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.090
it, etc.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.430
The management of the physical

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.590
distribution channel of the distributors,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.150
stores and such, is something that

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.090
takes, that has a lot of cost, requires

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.390
a lot of management and a lot of

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.090
focus, but it is that this type

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.290
of affiliate programs can exercise

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.190
ultra-scalable rapidly and it

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.930
is something we have to keep

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.970
in mind because it will grow.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.150
There will be more companies

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.530
in the coming years that incorporate

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.870
these partners programs and

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.510
allow them to grow very scalably,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.050
relying on the traffic

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.310
generated by others.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.930
Finally, I want to talk about the

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.030
on demand model.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.190
Finally, I will talk about the

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.290
models on demand.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.790
Within the on-demand models we

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.190
find companies whose value

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.950
proposal makes life more comfortable.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.630


00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.190
It allows us to hire services

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.270
that we have always been

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.950
able to hire, but in a more

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.010
agile, more comfortable

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.530
way, saving time, etc.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.610
And I give you examples, Cavify

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.950
or Uber, which is a service similar

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.410
to taxis, or Clean2, where

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.730
you can hire home cleaning

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.970
services, or Mr. D.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.150
Jeff, who hire at home

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.270
tinting, laundry,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.090
or an app like Globo, where

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.630
you hire urban messaging

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.010
services.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.050
The idea is clear, what

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.450
is it?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.890
And with regard to the business model,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.810
the challenge they have is that they

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.130
have to develop an enormous

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.790
ecosystem of alliances that are the

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.830
providers of those services, which

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.150
depends on each company and on each model.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.670
In some cases, they are people, such

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.950
as the Globo distributors, or in some

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.410
cases, they are companies.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.710
I think Mr.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.990
Jeff has tinteders behind.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.930
You have to develop a huge ecosystem

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.190
of alliances.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.390
And this is the key, manage that ecosystem

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.670
of alliances, because in accordance,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.430
say, with the capillary,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.310
the quality of the alliances you

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.350
have behind, you will provide

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.710
a faster, more agile and higher

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.030
quality service to the users

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.010
of the application.
