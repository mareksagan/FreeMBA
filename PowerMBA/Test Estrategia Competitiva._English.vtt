00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.740
The cost leader strategy involves

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.540
growing in market share by having

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.480
the lowest selling price in

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.180
the market.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.860
But we must bear in mind that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.600
this is possible.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.640
That is, the cost leader has the

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.540
possibility to go out to the market

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.780
at the lowest price, but it doesn’

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.040
t have to be so.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.360
You can choose to have the same

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.520
price as your competitors, but

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.420
get more margins or invest more

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.020
in marketing.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.600
Therefore not necessarily.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.720
The search for differentiation implies

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.020
that your customers choose you for being

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.240
better at something.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.920
Your customers are willing

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.320
to pay a higher price.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.200
They usually require more

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.100
investment.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.040
Yes, usually to be better what

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.080
you have to do is invest

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.580
more than others.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.520
They usually bring more investment.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.120
Those three options are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.240
correct.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.740
Porter’s generic strategy

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.400
matrix consists of two axes.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.420
One of the axes is the competitive advantage.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.760
There is no choice between differentiation

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.780
or cost leadership.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.660
And the other axis is the scope,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.900
depending on how much we target

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.160
the entire market, a specific segment.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.600
Rentability is usually higher

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.980
when your competitive advantage

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.560
is based on what?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.860
Leadership in cost or differentiation.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.580
If you choose to differentiate,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.320
the profitability

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.040
will be higher.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.420
Keep in mind that cost leadership

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.960
usually forces you to tighten

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.620
the margins and it is also that

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.900
customers choose you for being,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.120
usually for being cheaper.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.000
Competitive struggle in markets

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.660
where almost all competitors

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.000
have opted for cost leadership,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.940
what is usually greater or

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.560
lesser?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.200
The competitive struggle is greater.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.780
Keep in mind that customers

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.280
basically choose what they are

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.600
choosing usually by price, so

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.240
the competition is more

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240
fierce, there is greater price war.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.000
Scale economies are necessary

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.440
for companies looking for differentiation

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
or cost leadership.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.820


00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.520
Cost leadership is often very

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.300
much matched with scale economies,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.660
because to be the cost leader

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.940
in your sector, to have

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.500
the cost structure,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.640
scale economies are size

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.740
allow you to go down

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.080
unit costs.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.360
Scale economy always comes well,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.440
it’s always positive, but it’

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.560
s really much more necessary

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.020
when you choose to be the cost

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.480
leader.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.940
Customer loyalty is greater or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.440
lesser when you choose cost leadership,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.940
because it is less, it is that

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.780
they choose you, often they choose

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.820
you by price, so as one that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.740
has a lower price arrives,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.400
it will change.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.680
In premium segments, the competitive warfare

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.460
that is greater or lesser, since it is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.380
smaller, is the opposite case

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.760
of the previous one.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.380
Having a recognized brand

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.900
contributes positively to the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.080
competitive advantage

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.380
by differentiation or by cost

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.180
leadership, since the brand

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.500
contributes mainly to differentiation.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.440
In a market of raw materials

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.600
producers it is more common

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.800
to choose differentiation or

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.920
cost leadership.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.000
The commodity markets are

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.420
often very commoditized

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.500
markets, the proposals are

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.320
very indifferent, so customers

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.860
tend to choose the supplier

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.040
mainly based on the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.200
price and this forces all

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.780
producers or all suppliers

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.360
to have or almost be

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.460
forced to seek cost

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.560
leadership.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.180
The determining factor that helped Zappos

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.300
generate a competitive advantage,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.320
what was it?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.120
The customer service.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.660
Let’s think, the following factors

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.200
contribute to generating a competitive

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.340
advantage by differentiation,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.140
but there is one of them that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.560
is incorrect, right?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.980
The brand contributes to creating

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.400
greater value, customer service

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.500
too, operations efficiency

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.340
not, operations efficiency

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.720
to what helps you is to reduce

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.920
your cost structure, convenience

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.980
is a greater value and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.180
human capital is also

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.440
generator of greater

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.940
value, so the wrong response

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.800
is operations efficiency.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.900
Being a cost leader allows

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.100
you to earn quotas by reducing

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.400
prices, yes, you can put the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.360
lower prices and win the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.640
quota, get higher returns than

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.300
your direct competitors, also

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.240
having the lower cost structure

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.740
of your sector allows you

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.520
to get higher returns, also

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.340
allows you to set a lower or

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.120
similar price to your competitors,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080
you have that strength and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.860
reinvest more strongly

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.040
in marketing if you want,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.940
so all the above are correct.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.240
One of the key factors that has

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.520
helped McDonald's to be a cost

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.540
leader is to have a world-

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.160
renowned brand, well, it is clear

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.200
that McDonald's has a world-

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.140
renowned brand, but this

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.580
is not the determining factor

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.860
of being a cost leader, paying

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.620
employees that the competition

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.940
has no reason to be so or standardizing

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.480
all of all processes worldwide,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.780
well, because this is a factor

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.860
that directly contributes

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.780
to being the cost leader, McDonald's

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.740
thanks to the huge economy

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.920
of scale and to the huge

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.340
standardization allows

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.780
you to have a lower cost

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.860
structure than the rest

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.780
of its competitors.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.600
How did Mercadona reduce

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.980
its costs to meet the proposal

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.080
of always low

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.600
prices?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.020
Paying employees less?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.880
No, in fact in many cases it has

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.240
salaries higher than its

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.900
competitors, reducing the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.260
variety of brands and therefore

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.980
the number of suppliers, this

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.640
is one of the strategic

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.300
moves they made.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.060
They went from offering a number

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.240
of brands to offering many fewer

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.760
and that allowed them to have more

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.920
power over the suppliers of those

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.640
brands and integrating with some

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.680
of their suppliers inter-

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.380
suppliers then too.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.440
The answer is and is

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.900
correct.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.240
A segmentation or niche strategy

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.040
is only justified if the fact

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.720
of focusing on a smaller

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.960
market than your competitors

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.120
allows you.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.580
Why am I saying only?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.180
Because if you don’t have any

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.080
advantage over competitors

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.360
that target the entire market,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.960
you’re actually at a competitive

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.280
disadvantage because you’re

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.940
a smaller company.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.680
So what is the advantage or what

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.660
is the justification?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.600
Well, because it allows you

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.640
to know them much better as you

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.840
are sitting in a smaller segment

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.000
and better adapt to their needs.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.500
What is the main competitive

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.020
advantage of Tinder, the world’

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.380
s leading dating app?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.420
Which is?

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.860
Being a cost leader, differentiating

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.380
by having better technology or

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.080
the network effect that is generated

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.660
by connecting more users than

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.020
no one else in the world can.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.720
The competitive advantage is the

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.020
network effect.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
We are looking for a

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.980
specialized shop for wine.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.980
It is a local store.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.540
So, it’s already clear that it

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.640
competes in a niche segmentation

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.420
strategy.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.560
And we have to choose between that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.860
it is cost-specialized segmentation

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.440
or that it is differentiation-

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.740
specialized segmentation.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.960
Usually specialized stores,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.380
such as a wine store, do not

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.740
usually compete in cost

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.920
leadership.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.000
What they usually have more is

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.980
a higher value proposal,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.280
more advisory services, etc.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.000
Therefore, you are choosing a specialized

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.360
segmentation in differentiation.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.180
It is bringing more value than its

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.480
competitors, but focused on just

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.240
one niche.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.900
This is a niche by geographical

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.020
segmentation.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.620
Decathlon what is it?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.700
Leadership in cost, differentiation

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.240
and segmentation.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.720
Decathlon is clearly cost

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.760
leadership.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.740
It is aimed at the entire market,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.280
the entire sports sector, and

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.720
seeks competitive advantage by

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.100
having a lower cost structure

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.400
than the rest of competitors.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.560
This restaurant we see here in the menu

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.360
of the day, 13 euros, in what competition?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.500
Cost leadership, differentiation or

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.560
segmentation in differentiation or

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.660
segmentation specialized in

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.340
cost leadership.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.720
The first thing we have to be clear

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.240
is that it competes in segmentation,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.300
it is a local restaurant.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.180
And what does it?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.620
By differentiation, which would

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.660
be a luxury restaurant,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.080
or by cost leadership.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.160
What is clearly trying to

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.240
attract the public is a lower

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.220
cost and probably has adapted

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.280
its structure to

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.400
those prices.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.480
Therefore, you are looking for

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.940
specialized segmentation in

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.120
cost leadership.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.400
Now let’s look at what the variable

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.580
or segmentation criterion is.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.000
That is, why is this restaurant,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.580
when we say it opts for a

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.680
segmentation strategy,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.120
what is that segmentation based on?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.920
If we compare it with competitors

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.960
that know that they are aimed at the

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960
entire market.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.360
Are you specializing in a particular

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.300
product?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.020
No to.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.260
Is this a geographical specialization

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.200
or has it specialized in a

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.580
specific customer profile?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.080
Well, since it is a restaurant, the

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.480
specialization or segmentation in

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.140
this case is geographical.
