00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.400
The TAM SamSom is the model that

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.860
everyone now uses to estimate

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.260
the size of the market.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.840
It’s fine because you go from above

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.260
down to apply a series of hypotheses

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.860
and if you do it right you can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.020
come to conclusions that

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.700
make sense.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.320
How does it work?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.860
TAM is the Total Addressable

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.620
Market.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.700
It is the total market.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.960
You can give you an idea of the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.260
growth potential and we’re going down.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.700
The SAM is the market

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.660
you can serve.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.840
You often can’t serve the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.360
entire market because you have

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.040
some limitations for your business

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.980
model, your geographic

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.780
capacity, etc.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.980
Now let us look at an example.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.420
In the bottom, this would be your target

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.800
market because it is where you with

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.160
your limitations, with your current

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.420
model, with your current structure

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.980
can reach.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.040
We continue down and we reach the SOM

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.640
that is the Obtainable, it is the one

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.460
you can get.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.620
To estimate what you can get

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.760
that would be, for example,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.080
imagine a market share on

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.800
the SAM.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.940
Well, here what you have to do is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.600
apply a little there are a lot

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.040
of people who are fooled, but good.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.820
What is the difference between getting

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.260
a higher or lower share?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.060
It will depend on your current share,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.000
the money you have, whether you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.280
have a super important, a competitive

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.680
advantage, how much you are

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.060
growing, well, that kind of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.420
thing.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.620
Let us see it with an example.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.660
Let’s put the example of your

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.460
lottery, the app to buy lottery,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.360
etc.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.080
What is the TAM?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.300
What is the total market?

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.660
And let’s think of Spain because your

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.040
lottery is present in several countries.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.560
In Spain, the total lottery

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.020
market is around 8.5 billion.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.660
And now we’re down, but what

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.660
is your lottery business

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.060
model?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.460
Selling through an application.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.160
We will use this, that filter,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.140
that criterion.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.760
Well, let’s see what percentage,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.700
I’m not giving the full

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.580
data, but let’s.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.420
How much of the lottery is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.620
sold online today?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.580
It is about 10%.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.220
So your SAM is 850 million.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.460
It’s true that we could grow

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.660
a lot and we’ll grow a lot that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.780
percentage, but well, we’

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.080
ll start from what’s gone

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.560
today, right?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.600
Then the SAM, the lottery market

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.820
that is sold over the internet,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.360
is 850 million.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.120
So now you have to get to the SOM,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.920
the Obtainable and say, well,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.680
how much will I get from those

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.080
850 million?

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.960
How long will I get?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040
With a very differentiated

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.320
proposal, almost without

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.960
direct competitors, growing more

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.520
than the others, with a competitive

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.620
advantage because you have a good

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.380
application, etc.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.400
Well, then what you do here is apply

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.720
common sense and you say, well, because

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.040
I’m going to stay with the 10% of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.800
that market, with the 1, with the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.560
20, you know?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.500
It will depend on each case.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.260
But as you can see, this structure

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.580
makes sense because you go from

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.740
top to bottom applying a number

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.880
of criteria that are quite

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.760
reasonable.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.700
This is very good to use whenever

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.900
you have to make an estimate of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.220
the size of the market and more

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.840
because you’ll get well, you know?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.640
Because it’s a model that’

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.120
s pretty easy to defend and is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.220
pretty easy to understand.
