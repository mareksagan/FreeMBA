00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.710
Social Media Advertising

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.630
is sometimes called Social

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.530
Media Marketing but Social

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.030
Media Marketing is a broader

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.270
concept in which we could

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.530
englobate not only advertising

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.530
but inbound, organic

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.210
traffic generation

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.910
strategies.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.290
Today we will talk about

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.590
advertising, that is, we will

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.970
talk about hiring campaigns

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.230
through social media, and

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.510
this is something unstoppable.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.330
In fact, Facebook, which is

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.670
the highest exponent, has become

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.810
the second advertising

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.750
platform worldwide in absolute

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.610
terms, regardless

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.290
of what we are talking about on

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.190
and off, and Google is number one.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.720
First, what social

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.380
media?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.500
Well, since we can hire on almost

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.920
every social network, what happens

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.420
is that today we will

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.720
highlight a few.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.840
We will highlight those that have

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.180
become a major investment destination

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.280
by companies, and we have

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460
social networks with a social context,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.520
such as Facebook, the largest

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.680
of all, Instagram, which belongs

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.380
to Facebook, and you have

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.300
to know that you are hired

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.780
on the same platform as

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.500
Facebook.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.860
We will also show you how to do it.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.280
Twitter, for example, we have social

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.740
networks, for example, like LinkedIn,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.820
which is the professional social

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480
network, by excellence, or there

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.300
are social networks of pure content

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.260
like YouTube.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.020
In YouTube, for example, you have

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.880
to know that you are hired through

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.980
Google AdWords, which is

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.300
the platform we have seen where

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.960
SEM campaigns are hired

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.760
also in search engines.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.960
Now what we're going to do

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.320
is make a quick comparison with

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.340
some ideas from the main platforms.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.560
Well, the first thing you have to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.080
consider when prioritizing or choosing

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.020
which you want to invest

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.960
in or which your customer is.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.300
This is always so.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.380
If your customer has to think about what

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.240
your customer person is and what social

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.300
networks they consult, obviously, if your

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.360
customer is very young and only uses Instagram

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.840
and does not use Facebook, well,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.140
because it doesn't make sense that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.040
you use Facebook, it's so, so easy.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.260
But what I'll do is, let's highlight

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
some idea of each of

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.580
them.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.660
Facebook's biggest advantage is its reach.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.780
Almost everyone is on Facebook,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.560
right?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.140
2 billion active users.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.360
Instagram, which is contacted through

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.000
Facebook, well, because what we have

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is a slightly different

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600
use, it is a little younger people.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240
If your target audience, your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.920
customer person is younger, is younger,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.700
Instagram would probably be

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.780
the best option.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.700
Instagram is very attractive because

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.060
for companies that sell,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.280
companies that sell products

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.920
related to fashion, beauty,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.220
etc., related to the aesthetics

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.040
in general, less with functionality.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.880
Twitter is another social network

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.500
that along with Facebook, with Instagram,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.220
well, are social networks in

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.720
a social context in which you,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.460
well, share information but

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.840
also very related with friends,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.700
etc.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.540
LinkedIn is

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.280
different, why?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.740


00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.580
Because it is a professional

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.620
social network, then the context in

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.660
which the user uses LinkedIn is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.180
different.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.360
It is usually at work and it is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.260
also that it is not related to your

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360
personal life but to professional

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.420
issues, articles are shared, etc.,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.240
and you probably already

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.960
know it.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.520
What are the implications of this

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.480
as a advertising platform?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.340
Well, because it is mainly used

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.860
by companies that sell to B2B,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.700
basically it is so, with higher

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.360
average tokens, etc.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.340
It is rare for someone who sells,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.980
because I don't know, watches or sunglasses

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.460
use LinkedIn, but on LinkedIn

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.820
we can see more campaigns from

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.300
software companies, professional

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.540
services, etc.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.520
And with regard to the cost, we have

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.440
to keep in mind that the traffic generated

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.400
by LinkedIn is more expensive in general.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.240
The CPM, the cost per thousand

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.540
impressions, is good, as it can sometimes

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.760
be up to five times higher.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.540
But well, it's a matter of it compensating

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.740
you because in theory it can be

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.700
more qualified traffic, etc.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.300
YouTube is a social network because

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.300
it is a social network of pure

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.240
content in which a small percentage

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.740
of its users generate all

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.840
the content that these videos

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.620
are and are consumed by

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.260
others.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.220
There are fewer interactions,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.360
it allows you to do less tracking,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.480
which happens that it is true that

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.360
in some cases like YouTube is used

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.500
almost as a search engine, especially

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.500
young people, do searches on

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.140
YouTube and not on Google.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.840
Well, you can have good impacts

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.680
because you can benefit

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.360
from the advantages of search engine

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.400
marketing and it is that when

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.420
they look for you, not you, but

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.620
when they do searches related

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.920
to your product or service,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.120
that traffic can be more qualified

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.580
than when you are directly

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.800
impacting someone who is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.720
not looking for anything related.
