WEBVTT

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.570
To put ourselves in a position,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.310
we have, we are capturing leads and

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.430
our goal is to convert those leads

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.350
into sales, optimize the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.710
conversion ratio.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.850
One of the main tools or

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.770
strategies you need

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.430
to know is lead nurturing.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.710
What is Lead Nurturing?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.010
Because it is the set, as

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.370
we said, of tactics, of

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.890
tools that are aimed at we will

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.350
go to feed or nourish those leads

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930
with the aim of turning

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.350
them into sales.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.930
What we will do is, automatically,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990
we will establish a value

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.030
relationship with those leads

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.990
and we will push them or we

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.190
will help them go down

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.330
the funnel until they become

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.190
customers or sales.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.170
What are the benefits or benefits

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.490
of lead nurturing?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.750
Why is it so important to work on it?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.710
One, it's very obvious because it helps

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650
us optimize conversions.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.790
We have spent money on generating

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.590
traffic, we have managed to convert

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.690
leads, what happens is that leads

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.430
in a very high percentage are

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.670
still not willing to buy and we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.270
have to manage that relationship

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.990
with the aim of increasing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.590
the ROI.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.170
Benefit number two, and it's something

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230
I want you to understand and it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.410
that lead nurturing by being

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.890
automated is scalable.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.430
We'll think that instead of doing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.050
a good lead nurturing what

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.490
we have is a team of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.470
marketers managing that funnel.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.830
If we grow, we need to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.810
hire more people.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370
What is the case with lead nurturing?

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.510
If we are automated, the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.370
cost does not increase.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.910
It may increase a little because

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.070
we'll have to pay more license

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.370
for the software tool we

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.930
use, but it's ultra-scalable,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.010
mainly because of the concept

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.130
that it's automated.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.770
Look at it, it's a different strategy.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.950
If we rely on advertising

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.830
to sell, we have a funnel in

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.650
which only a number of leads

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.010
can enter that we can

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.770
manage with the advertising.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.490
If we grow, we will have to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.890
hire more people.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.550
This is different, because by being

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.690
automated, by not generating additional

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.650
marginal costs, what we do is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.630
like throwing the net and fishing

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.070
everything we can.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.910
And of that, that we fish, there

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.150
will be a percentage that ends

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.730
up becoming sales, simply

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.790
because we have automated

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.610
a process, a relationship

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.690
with them.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.810
You probably already know

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.910
what the benefits are.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410
And now what I want is that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.410
you know in general how this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.070
is done.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.510
If you want to implement a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.790
lead nurturing strategy, what

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.790
do you need to do?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.920
First, we need

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680
a software tool.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.200
Why is it?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.220
Because, as I said, this is automatic

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100
and in addition it is that a lot

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.500
of information, many contacts,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.520
many customers, etc. are generated.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.480
We need software.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.780
What kind of software?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.400
Well, because you are worth a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.880
CRM, CRMs have the possibility

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.840
to automate this type of actions

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.680
and what has grown in recent years

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.760
are tools that are called

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.080
marketing automation.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.180
ActiCampaign, for example, which

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.440
is the one we use, or as HubSpot

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.420
or as Marketo, are tools that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.540
incorporate this type of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.500
automated processes and also

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.700
a CRM.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.620
They are tools that are paid in

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.260
the format software as a service,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.880
which what you do is pay every

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.700
month a fee.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.640
And you will pay fees based on

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.660
the size of your business,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.980
the number of emails you are

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.780
sending, the number of records

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.980
you are incorporating, etc.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.920
But let's, they are relatively

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.940
affordable tools that you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.940
can go and try, etc.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880
We already have the tool.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.060
What we need to do now is to configure it.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.360
We need to set up a flow of contacts.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.940
They are mainly emails.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.720
Basically, marketing automation

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.680
or lead nurturing has almost

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.840
always been based primarily

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.460
on sending emails.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.360
Well, this is the next step.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.680
We have to define that flow.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.460
These are the emails we will send.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.620
What kind of emails, to whom,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.000
at what time, etc.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.020
We have all this in the tool.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.320
Point number three.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.340
Well, but what kind of content are we

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.200
going to send?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.560
What kind of emails will we send?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.040
There are different types of

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.940
them, and we will give you some

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.120
examples that we use.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.700
One of the main or most important

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.260
factors in lead nurturing

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.280
is that you permanently

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.200
deliver value.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.820
Uninterested value to your leads.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.560
For example, we are

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.120
sending out free classes.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.620
We are constantly sending classes.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.200
There are also emails in which

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.080
we do is inform the leads

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.220
of our product.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.980
We are selling ourselves.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.220
There are more, but

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.620
more emails.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.700
And we have several emails

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.620
that are not very direct,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.920
but that in the end what

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.000
we are doing is to sell

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.700
our product, sell us.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.240
And we also have to have

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.620
closing email contacts.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.940
This is very important.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.800
You have to deliver value, you have

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.880
to convince, but at some point

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.620
you have to encourage your customer

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.980
to make the decision.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.920
And, for example, we have emails

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.360
in which we report the dates of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.540
the next edition and we put, for

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.960
example, videos with students'

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.400
testimonies, which is a good

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.060
argument to convince.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.460
Another point to bear in mind,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.520
point four, is that all those

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.060
contents have to be adapted.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.300
They must be adapted according

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.240
to different factors.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.240
One of these is called lead

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.100
scoring.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.740
Basically, leads are not all

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.320
on the same point.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.800
There are leads that are more

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.320
qualified and there are leads that

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
are less qualified.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.540
Depending on the situation, you will

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.980
have to send a message or a message.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.560
I will give you an example.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.820
We and all companies capture

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.600
leads in different ways.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.320
In this case, I will tell you two strategies.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.380
One, which is more punctual, is

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.600
a lead magnet strategy.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960
A great leads.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.500
What we did was share and

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.820
we captured, because that, there

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.940
have been hundreds of comments,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.680
I don't know if hundreds of

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.300
leads, etc.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.200
of barbarity.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.340
But is this people who have left

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.820
us the data, think, a highly qualified

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.260
lead or a poorly qualified lead?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.860
It is a poorly qualified lead.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.400
Why is it?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.700
Because he has left you the data because

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.760
he wants it, the only thing he wants at

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.160
this point is that you deliver

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.780
value to him.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.020
But he is not leaving you the data because

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.380
he is already interested in your proposal.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.260
Instead, when we capture

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.020
leads on the website, where

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.900
call to action is free,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.240
three classes free, etc.,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.340
they are more qualified

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.760
leads.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.260
Because you have in mind that they are

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.960
leaving us the data because they

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.420
already know our proposal and have

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.620
some interest.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.720
Therefore, we can draw a funnel

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.320
in which we classify the leads in

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.900
which they are leads, for example,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.440
from someone who has subscribed

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.760
to a newsletter, who has subscribed,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.440
who has left you the data because

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.560
he wants you to deliver

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.360
a free ebook or a lead

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.120
magnet, etc.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.120
And below we have leads that are

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.500
more qualified because, well, because

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.220
they have already shown that they

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.920
have some interest in your proposal.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.880
And when someone leaves us the

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.620
data on the web page because he

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.380
wants three classes for free, it is

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.460
that he understands Power MBA and is

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.740
a more qualified lead than if

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.540
he only wanted us to tell him the

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.120
ten keys to being a good entrepreneur,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.480
for example.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.820
Therefore, the conclusion is that you

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.400
have to adapt those messages according

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.900
to the phase in which the lead

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.820
is, which is the lead scoring.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.260
I will give you two more advice.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.400
The following is that the messages

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.660
we send, the contents,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.080
etc., must be adapted

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.000
also in a very personal way.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.140
And how can we do this?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.980
We can adapt them according

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.900
to the concrete interactions

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.740
that this lead has had

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.560
with us.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.960
This is sometimes called direct response

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.000
marketing.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.520
I'll give you an example that

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.580
you will understand very

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.040
well.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.780
We send you three

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.580
free leads today.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.000
Well, we analyze, it does the tool

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.500
itself according to whether the

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.800
lead has opened or not one class

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.280
or another, we send emails

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.500
adapted to them, we know that you

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.740
only saw the first of the classes,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.400
or we know that you saw

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.020
the first two, you lost this.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.440
It is an example that we have to

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.140
customize not only for the

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.040
moment in which it is, but we

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.060
have to customize according

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.540
to what has done that lead

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.600
specifically.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.480
And the last of the tips is that

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.900
lead nurturing, in principle we

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.960
are talking about email

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.640
marketing, is a flow of emails,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.540
but you really have to open a

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.940
little mind and you have to do, you

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.980
have to have a broader conversion

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.240
strategy.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.900
We have to coordinate this with,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.060
we can reinforce it with retargeting

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.280
in different channels, that you

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.060
will be re-appearing ads in social

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.080
networks or in display in media,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.940
or we can do, for example,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.260
we can do tele marketing

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.740
in some cases to accompany that

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.920
lead, or we should,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.580
if there is a sales department

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.800
should be very coordinated

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.320
all this, lead nurturing,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.580
marketing automation with

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.280
the sales department.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.240
To get you in the moment

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.820
we identify, imagine that one

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.860
of our leads has opened,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.020
is opening a percentage, opens

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.620
the emails or clicks within

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.540
the emails we are sending you,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.780
because at that time we can

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.940
consider that it is a very

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.460
hot lead and it is a good

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.900
time for it to go to sales.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.460
We will give you a brief overview

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.800
of how to implement a good

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.240
lead nurturing strategy.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.200
First, we need a tool.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.540
There are several tools on the

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.100
market and they are also easy to hire.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.200
Second, you have to define the

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.460
flow of emails, contacts,

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.200
the different touch points you

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.240
will have with customers, that

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.460
you can condition them

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.660
according to a lot of

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.380
things, define the time in

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.280
which they are sent, to whom,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.660
what messages, etc.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.680
We have to work on the different

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.420
emails we will send and we have

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.040
seen that we can send emails

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.500
creating value to foster a good

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.120
relationship, emails in which

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.800
we reinforce or are selling

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.540
our product and also we have

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.320
to send at some point emails

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.640
aimed at closing.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.280
In addition, what you need to keep

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.180
in mind is that those emails

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.960
that we send have to be

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.160
conditioned according to different

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.360
factors.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.720
One of them is what we call lead

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.680
scoring, that is, leads are

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.660
not all at the same time.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.360
Depending on, for example, how they

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.040
have come to us, whether they know

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.000
us or don't know us, etc.,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.580
because it will make sense to

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.760
send them a type of message or others.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.800
If the lead has left us the data because

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.600
we have offered you value content that

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.620
is interesting to you but

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.400
does not know us, because we will

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.460
have to send you emails talking

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.020
to you about our proposal.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.320
In contrast, if it turns out that the lead

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.620
has left us their data because he wants

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.540
a free trial or something like that,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.960
he already knows us, we will have to

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.860
be one we can go maybe already

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.980
to offer him the closure, that is,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.780
to motivate him to buy.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.980
In addition, another tip is that

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.060
conversions will increase a lot

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.480
if we are able to send emails very

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.360
personal and very adapted

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.900
to interactions he has had, whether

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.800
he has opened the emails

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.220
or not, when he has opened

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.380
them, etc.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.560
And finally, keep in mind that lead

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.740
nurturing is an excellent strategy

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.240
but we have to combine it

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.500
or we can combine it with another

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.700
type of channels, because like

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.480
social networks, like network

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.740
targeting and with telemarketing

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.900
or, for example, if we have

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.260
a sales department has to be

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.580
absolutely coordinated

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.140
the moment in which those

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.520
leads go to sales.
