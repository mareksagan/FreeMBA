WEBVTT

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.860
Let's talk about leadership styles.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.080
Leadership styles determine

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.960
how the leader makes decisions,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.360
how he relates to the members

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.640
of his team, how he tries

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.340
to motivate them, etc.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A lot has been written about this.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.240
You have to keep in mind that there

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.600
are endless models or classifications,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.000
matrix, etc., which classify

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.220
the different types of leader

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.240
according to their style.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.780
Knowing them all would be impossible,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.140
it makes no sense.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.240
There is infinity.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.120
And we talk about transformational,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660
charismatic, servile, autocratic,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.140
etc. leader.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.040
We're going to do today is deepen

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.980
the most basic model of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.000
all, which is to establish

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.080
three styles of leadership.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.500
Autocratic, democratic and delegative

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.940
or laissez-faire, which is to

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.640
let do.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.140
Now we will see.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.570
And before we go deeper into

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.990
the model, I want you to consider

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.250
why it is interesting to know

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.870
at least one of the models,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.170
like today's one, in what it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.910
will help us.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.590
Well, when you understand

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.750
the different types of leadership,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
it's easier for you to make a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.650
diagnosis and understand what

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.550
style you tend to be.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.130
And from that knowledge it is easier

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.410
to be a better leader or develop

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.750
yourself, because it is part of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.710
a situation in which you understand

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.890
how you behave.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.510
That on one side.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.150
This will help us make a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.890
diagnosis.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.990
And on the other hand, and more

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.850
importantly, it is that leadership

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.230
styles are not good or bad in themselves,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.110
but what we have to do is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.990
understand what is the most

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.650
suitable leadership style

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.830
for the situation we are in.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.630
The situation depends on many

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.250
things, but it mainly depends

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670
on the type of work, the type

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.190
of function, the tasks you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.430
have to exercise.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.270
And it also depends on the members

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.810
of your team, how they are, what

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.450
their motivations are, what their

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.070
abilities, their experience, etc.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.170
So, in the end, what I want you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.810
to stay with is that you can lead

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.550
in thousands of different ways,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.150
that each person has a certain tendency

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.990
to one style of leadership or

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.930
another, but that the important

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.590
thing is to understand what

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.090
styles of leadership are

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.930
most suitable for each of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.450
the circumstances in which

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.950
we are.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.950
Therefore, from all this knowledge

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.730
it is easier for you to find

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.150
the style of leadership that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.530
best comes to you and that

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.750
is more suitable for the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.730
situation you are in.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.200
As I told you, we will deepen into a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.300
model that establishes that there are

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.840
or that classifies the styles of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.860
leadership in three, that this is

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.690
not white, we have the most authoritarian

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.550
style, which is called autocratic,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.970
and in the other we have a style

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.650
that is that we can call it delegative,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.070
that is laissez faire, that I

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.470
say it in French with poor pronunciation,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.630
but because it is that this

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.850
term is used in this, and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.490
in the middle we have a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.510
style that is more democratic.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.410
Let's describe one by one, let'

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.090
s see what the features are.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.730
We are in the authoritarian

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.630
style.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.250
In this case, we talk about the authoritarian

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.830
leader when the decisions are taken

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.130
by the leader, who in this case

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.910
is the boss, and also has absolute

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.750
control over everything that happens

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.750
within his team.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.990
There is little freedom.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.710
Team members act basically by

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.150
coercion, following the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.430
rules, that is, the leader what

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.430
he does is direct the team

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.350
giving orders, point.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.790
Communication, as you can imagine,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.050
goes from above down, the boss, which

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.450
in this case the leader and the boss

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.390
is the same, determines the orders

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.630
and the others what they do

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.250
is act in accordance.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.690
I want you to keep in mind that, as

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.750
a point to the favor, productivity

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.490
is very high.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.470
Decisions are made quickly and everything

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.730
fits very well, everything

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.470
works very well, like a clock.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.450
If we analyze the democratic

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.130
style, in this case, as in the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.630
authoritarian, the decisions

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.670
are taken by the leader.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.470
What happens is that in this style,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.790
which is also called participative

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.370
or sometimes called consultative,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.810
it is called very different

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.200
ways, decisions are

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.820
taken by the boss.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.920
The leader takes into account

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:17.160
the different ranges.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.780
Imagine since the most seemed the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.680
authoritarian in which the ideas are

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.740
proposed by the leader and what

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.280
he does is consult them to see what

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.040
you think.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.640
Even a style that is more

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.220
participative yet where the leader

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.720
does is promote ideas that

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.320
arise from the team, because

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.060
imagine, from a brainstorming.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.190
In this case, the control that the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.290
leader has has so much need to have

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.710
absolute control and what happens,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.750
one of the benefits is that in

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.650
this case the team members do not

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.290
act only by coercion, by

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.970
obligation, by norm, but

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.870
that in many cases what they take

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.790
is motivation because they

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.790
feel partisans.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.350
That makes them act.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.750
Therefore, the leader here does

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.350
not only direct by orders, but

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.210
what he does is like a guide.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.430
Support the team and ultimately work them out.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.790
Communication does flow both

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.250
from top to bottom and from

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.770
bottom to top and I want

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.150
you to keep in mind that in

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.090
this case productivity is lower.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.990
Think about it, when we have

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.790
teams where we can accommodate

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.230
everyone, decisions are made

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.950
more democratically, etc.,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.410
well, because decisions are slower.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.330
It is possible and is often one of the benefits.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.550
In the end, better decisions

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.170
are made, more value is generated, and so on.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.410
Better ideas come out, yes, but it'

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.810
s slower.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.410
between a dictatorship and

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.650
a democracy.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.150
In a dictatorship,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.450
everything works, say,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.270
much faster.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.730
In democracy, productivity is

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.150
a little lower.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.590
Now we go to the extreme where

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.750
freedom is greater.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.590
In this case, decisions are not

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.190
even taken by the leader, but

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.750
by the team members who are

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.510
organized into committees or

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.350
whatever.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.310
This is where there is less

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.530
control.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.880
With regard to motivation, it may

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.520
seem that when the style is very

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.700
delegative, with a lot of freedom,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.540
the motivation could be

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.580
greater, but in many cases

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.420
it is not.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.460
In many cases, there is

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.840
a lot of dismotivation.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.380
The motivation here will depend

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.180
on how the team members are.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.700
There are people who like this style because

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.000
they are very proactive people, who

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.120
like to contribute, etc.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.100
And there are people who don't like

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
that, who like to know what they

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.620
have to do at every moment.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.660
Depending on the profile of the

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.960
team members, this leadership

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.160
style can be very motivating

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.680
or very dismotivating.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.760
In this case, leaders give little

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.960
direction, give little

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.020
guidance, get little, participate

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.800
little.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.780
Communication here is more common

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.640
that it goes from below, from

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.880
the team members, to the leader

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.120
who basically what they do is to

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.380
inform you of what is happening,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.160
reporting you than the reverse,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.460
as we were saying.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.620
Productivity is very

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.600
low because the...

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.980
They often generate situations

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.080
where roles are not well

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.040
defined, etc.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.560
As we can see, this style, this

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.300
extreme, has quite a few disadvantages.
