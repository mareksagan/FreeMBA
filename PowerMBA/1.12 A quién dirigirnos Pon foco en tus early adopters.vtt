00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.400
I think your case is clearly

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920
clear of what we were talking

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.360
about early adopters, and it is that

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.680
when you launch a value proposal,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.500
when you enter a new market,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.720
etc., etc., the more innovative,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140
more necessary is to do this,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.560
you have to focus, that is, segment

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.000
a lot by some variable or whatever,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
identify what your niche, your customer

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.760
person, who are the early adopters,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.780
with which you fit the perfection

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.040
and focus on them, and then you

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.760
will already grow, if you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.540
can grow that there are

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.540
people who do not exceed that,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.920
the abyss they call,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.300
cross the abyss.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.800
In your case, how did you segment

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.480
that, who were you initially addressing

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.020
or who were the early

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.700
adopters?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.760
For in our case, ten years ago in

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.520
Spain, it was fundamental to focus

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.360
because in the end if you pick

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.280
up the entire population with many

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.080
messages, you end up without

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.680
starting any one, we went directly

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.180
to a very clear segment that were young

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.200
students, 18-24 years and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.000
the message or the value proposal

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.260
was very clear and it is the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.680
price, you are a student, you want

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.500
to travel, you don't have a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.820
paste or then I buy the car or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.060
I stay at home.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.000
That is, the early adopter were

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.340
young university students who

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.560
sought to save or be able to travel at

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.740
an affordable price, that is,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.180
you identify your early adopters by

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.060
introducing two variables, it is the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.520
conjunction of two variables that is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.320
age and benefit and you get that, the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.540
university students who want

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.520
to travel and so on.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.660
But at some point it is obvious that

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.640
you have overcome that, you have

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.880
crossed that abyss because you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
are now a massive company with

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.900
customers of different profiles,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.720
profits, etc.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.720
How was that, how was it?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.400
Well the beautiful part of the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.780
early adopters in our case was

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.240
that they were growing and we realized

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.180
that really people likely car

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.860
for the first time for pure rational

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.560
fact, the price savings try

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.860
it, but repeat for a more

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380
emotional fact.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.960
They go through the physical environment

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.660
and inside the car of an

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.180
enriching experience and want

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.380
to repeat, but to such a point

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.560
that many users have told us

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.660
that the price is no longer

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.400
so important.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.320
What we have done, what has

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.840
happened is that those early adopters

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.220
have grown and now the reality

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.500
is that our community is much

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.160
more homogeneous.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.320
Today, we have a third of users between

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.880
the ages of 25 and up to 34 and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.860
already a third is over 35 years

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.380
old.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.200
That has meant that we can cover

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.520
that critical mass, that those early

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.200
adopters of 10 years ago are no longer

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.460
so young and that in addition the mouth-

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.060
to-mouth help us that those brand

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.200
ambassadors speak well of blablacing

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.840
and other people not so young

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.900
try blablacing for the first time.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.700
You have segmented a lot, age

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.940
and benefit, a very specific

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.160
segment, a personal customer and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.060
the early adopter university,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.900
you can overcome this and you can

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.920
overcome it and we can analyze

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.980
it from the two variables because

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.720
it is not only the segment of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.120
young people but the age has

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.420
been over and also not only they

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.800
seek you to save but they seek

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.900
you for other benefits,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.340
especially those that repeat.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.580
It has also been very important

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.080
for us to adapt the brand to this

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.200
evolution.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.060
I don't know if you remember, at least

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.300
those who have used blablacar for

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.480
a long time, at first blablacar

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.880
had a very functional logo where

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.920
a wheel appeared, many colours,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.100
it was even a little childish

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.000
and it is precisely because

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.660
the goal at that time was to educate,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.260
you saw a wheel because you

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.500
already related it to something

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.540
that happened inside a

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.360
car, people were very young,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.260
etc.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.200
That has evolved and as our

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.600
community has become more homogeneous

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.400
and is bigger, more mature,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.840
our brand has also had

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.020
to evolve and become

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.860
more mature.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.960
That's why we took last year in

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.300
2018 in January a rebranding where

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.180
we put this, the most mature

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180
brand and the most emotional

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.820
part you can see.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.420
That is, it is just the consequence of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.900
what you said, of going to the most

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.140
market in terms of age.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.980
This is the result

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.940
of early adopters.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.300


00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.880
As for age and profit, it is

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.680
no longer just savings.
