00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.610
It is important to understand what

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.250
are the different bodies of government,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.010
how decisions are made in a company

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.190
and also how it affects the size

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.730
of the company, because very

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.190
small companies are not structured

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.670
equally as a startup or a listed

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.430
company, for example.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.010
First, I would like to

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.350
have a general view.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.530
We have shareholders, the body

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.130
is called in Spain General Assembly,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.450
but in other places it is called

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.070
Assembly, Joint Members, etc.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.450
Below the shareholders, who

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.510
are the owners of the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.070
company, we have the main

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.130
management body, which can

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.530
be managers or it can be

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.850
a board of directors,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.990
who appoint a CEO and below

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.510
the CEO in large companies

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.130
we have a board of

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.050
directors.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.570
We go one by one.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.290
Let's start with the shareholders.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.670
The shareholders are the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.350
owners of the company, they are

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.530
the ones who have the true absolute

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.390
control of the company.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.410
It can condition absolutely everything

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.830
that happens below, what happens is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.830
that shareholders do not make all

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.810
the decisions and that is why we

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.950
have that structure that we have

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.930
seen with different government

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.430
bodies.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170
The body that groups shareholders

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.450
is the General Shareholders' Board

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.150
in Spain, the General Assembly,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.550
the Board of Shareholders, etc.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.550
Each of them is called a form.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.030
You have to keep in mind that it

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.090
is the supreme body, which could

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.930
actually make the most important decisions.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.370
It is established in a legal manner

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.090
that there are a series of decisions

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.150
that are taken in the General Assembly,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.450
naming the councillors, changing

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330
the statutes, approving the annual

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.110
accounts, etc.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.950
These decisions are reserved

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.510
for the General Meeting of Shareholders.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.290


00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.930
As I said, one of the tasks

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.070
is to appoint the councillors,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.370
so we continue to go down.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.090
Now let's talk about the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.810
main management or management

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.950
body.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.910
What is?

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.550
In small companies, imagine that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.310
there is only one owner and that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.250
it is the single manager or sometimes

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.930
there are several solidary managers,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710
but what happens is that when you

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.310
reach a certain size what

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.170
you have is a board of management.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.810
When is it worth having

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.510
a management board regarding

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.710
being managers?

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.490
This is solidary, solidarity, and so on.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.090
Well, let's think that it is a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.770
more complex stock structure

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.190
in which there are several

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.810
interest groups.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.350
Imagine that we are a family business

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.870
in which there are, I know,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.430
six nuclei or six families.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.470
Well, because there can be

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.950
conflicts of interest, each has

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890
its own different interests, etc.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.930
What it does then is, what it does

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.870
is that it creates an organ that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.590
is the board of directors.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.010
Or we think, for example, that it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.150
is a startup in which a venture

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.970
capital enters and the venture

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.330
capital wants to have a certain,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.130
wants to have participation in

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.470
decision-making, so a board

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.770
of management is created

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.690
in which the venture capital

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.690
participates.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.250
How many times does the council meet?

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.930
Well, because this depends

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.490
on, depending on, you can meet

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.350
every three months or with the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930
periodicity that is convenient

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.750
or reasonable depending on the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.630
moment you are, the decisions

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.350
you have to make, etc.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.130
What decisions are taken in the Council?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470
Strategic decisions are made.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.270
And this is a concept that depends on

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.110
each company, but imagine, because

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.550
to define the strategic plan, to make

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.570
the decision to enter another country

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.970
or not, or to define the policy

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.310
of dividends, or if we want

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.790
to hire a managing director,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.190
to set the goals for the coming

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.670
year.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.030
Well, these are functions that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.850
make sense that it is important to

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.190
understand who forms the board of directors.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.330
Well, as I said before, the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.790
General Board, shareholders

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.650
appoint the councillors, so,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.010
usually, shareholders

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.250
want to be represented

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.650
in the board.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.190
And I return to the example,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.770
six families, a family business,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.430
well, because the six family

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.110
nuclei would like to have

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.650
participation in the council

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.990
and we will put that each names

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.610
a counselor.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.850
That is, what you have to understand

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.570
is that in the end the board

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.870
is the management body, so shareholders

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.270
will want to be present

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.930
in some way or another.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.910
If a fund enters, it will put a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.130
counselor in the board of

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.250
directors, appointed by the fund.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.190
The counselors may be

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.570
shareholders, but they do

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.210
not have to be shareholders.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.290
In Spain, the concept is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.630
Sunday counselors, who are shareholders

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.270
of the company, but there are

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.830
independent counselors.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.690
Independent advisors have functions,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.430
for example, as defense of

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.610
the interests of the entire shareholder

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.090
or the entire company itself,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.590
because they are not conditioned,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.530
because they are independent,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.170
as we say.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.850
The reality is that independent counselors

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.110
are often incorporated into

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.550
the advice because they bring you

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.510
things, they bring you value.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.170
We will think that they bring

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.110
you knowledge, that you file

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.530
as a counselor to an external who

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.650
has a like a consultant you

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.670
have there permanently.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.110
Or sometimes what is done is to file

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.130
counselors who have a lot of

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.630
networking, which will allow you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.910
to grow, access contacts that you

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.770
could not do.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.710
Sometimes the counselors charge and

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.590
sometimes they don't.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.250
This will be decided by the General Meeting of Shareholders.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.450
In listed companies, for example,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.710
in very large companies, they

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.470
have independent advisors

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.750
who earn a very successful

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.030
track record, who participate

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.390
in one or several boards

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.230
of management.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.710
One of the advisors is the delegate

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.650
counselor.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.350
This is a key figure.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.470
The CEO is responsible

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.450
for the daily management of

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.450
the company.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.330
That is, in the board the most

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.110
strategic decisions are made, the

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.630
strategic plan, for example, and

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.290
the management is delegated

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.090
to the CEO.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.850
Hence comes the name.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.050
Sometimes you'll hear the CEO,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.390
sometimes you'll be put

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.730
on a CEO post, etc.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.330
The board of directors

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.530
is the council in which the

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.510
responsibility is delegated.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.670
In family, what is usually

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.730
done is that the delegate

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.430
counselor is out.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.150
I return to the example.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.230
6 family nuclei and it is almost

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.690
better to put a delegate counselor that

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.030
is someone who, in addition to being

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.510
very good, can contribute a lot,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.110
that comes from the sector, that

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.210
avoids conflicts of interest.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.670
Because you put a third party who

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.950
will make the decisions always

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.950
thinking about the good of the company

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.210
itself and will not be conditioned

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.650
by the interests that each of

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.070
the relatives can have.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.950
For example, imagine you're going to file your

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.730
son or nephew or something like that.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.290
Finally, we have the management board.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.690
This is true of all large companies.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.630
What the CEO does is to create

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.950
a management committee in which

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.330
the company's managers participate.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.010


00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.690
Imagine that you can be formed

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.510
by the marketing, operations,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.610
financial, etc.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.610
director.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.630
Depending on whether the company

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.110
is larger or smaller, the board

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.530
of directors will be larger

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.270
or smaller.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.470
It is quite logical.
