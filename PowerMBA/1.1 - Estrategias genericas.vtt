WEBVTT

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.090
We will look at one of the most

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.430
basic and well-known models

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.730
of strategy and management.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.710
These are the general strategies of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.370
Michael Porter.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.130
It is a model that is born

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.530
in the mid-1980s and has

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.190
influenced all literature,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.470
all knowledge, all knowledge

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.970
that is studied in business

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.010
schools.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.210
It is a very useful tool that

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.850
is aimed at helping us

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.910
understand what alternatives

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.470
or decisions a company

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.890
has to make about how to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.030
compete.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.530
And because it is very simple and because

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.410
it is applicable to a vast majority

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.650
of cases, it has had that huge spread.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.850
Let's see what Michael Porter

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.430
says.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.490
Michael Porter says there

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.250
are only two sources

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.750
of competitive advantage.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.470
Only two.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.050
And it is that you have to choose between

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.370
differentiation, that is, between

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.890
being the best in something,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.510
between incorporating some feature to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.870
your proposal to value that customers

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.010
value and are willing to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370
pay for it, you don't have to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.530
be better in everything, right?

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.170
You have to be better at something,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.850
something your customers perceive.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.990
That is the number one

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.670
alternative.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.170
And the second is to be a cost

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.690
leader, that is, to be able to produce

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.470
or provide services at a lower

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.150
cost than your competitors.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.490
That doesn't mean you are the cheapest.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.870
It can be the cheapest, but

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.030
also what you can choose is to have

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.050
more margins, right?

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.970
These are the two alternatives, the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.650
two sources of competitive advantage.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.590
This is the competitive

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.650
strategy of Michael

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.290
Porter.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.430
As we see, in the axis of the X we

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.570
have to choose between cost leadership

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.810
and between differentiation.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.950
And there is another decision that is

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.110
depending on the scope to which we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110
are going to go.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.890
Whether we are going to target the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.910
entire market, all segments of the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.050
market, or what we are going to do

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.130
is focus on one part of that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.250
market in a segment.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.770
Then, from those two axes, from

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.450
those two dimensions, we

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.290
have the generic strategies.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.790
Sometimes they say they are three,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.370
and sometimes they say they

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.070
are four.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.910
They are mainly leading in cost,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.610
differentiation and segmentation.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.090
Let's see one by one.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.690
Leadership in cost.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.210
You can choose to be the cost leader

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.090
in your market.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.870
They are usually companies that are

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.130
leaders in the entire market.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.650
Why is it?

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.570
Because to be a cost leader, it

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.370
helps to size, economics of scale.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.410
A good example is Ryanair.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.830
Ryanair is the cost leader in

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.370
the airline sector.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.390
As we will see in the next

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.410
class, this requires, it has very

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.990
many implications in the model and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.830
in the management of your business.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.950
Being a cost leader requires you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.990
to take, requires a real commitment

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.350
to saving costs across

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.090
the value chain.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.650
You can choose differentiation and it'

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.970
s to incorporate some

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.570
feature that allows you to get your

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.570
customers to buy you for that, right?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.970
In this case, we are also

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.170
talking about the entire

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.670
market.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.430
In the airline sector, we could

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.810
clearly, there are several examples,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.930
but American Airlines is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.850
one of them.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.330
In addition, even the mission

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.070
of American Airlines, which they

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.650
say is very clear, are

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.570
transmitting that they have opted

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.910
for a differentiation strategy.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.910
No one chooses American Airlines for its

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.830
price, right?

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.350
They choose it for the value they perceive.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.930
Finally, we have the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.230
segmentation strategy.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.430
The main difference with the above

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.110
is that in this case you do what

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.970
you do is focus on one single segment

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.530
within the market.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.950
Your target market is smaller, but

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.050
as you are focusing on a smaller

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.770
segment, it allows you to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.330
generate certain advantages

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.410
in that segment over those

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.230
that target the entire market

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.870
because you know it better.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.870
You can better adapt to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.010
the needs, problems, etc.,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.330
of that segment, right?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.310
Usually, this, the fact of focusing

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.590
on just one segment, is not

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.410
usually enough.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.770
You have to choose between being

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.710
a cost leader or being

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.850
differentiated.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.830
And an example, in this case, would

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.850
be segmentation and differentiation

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.330
NetJets, which is a company with

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.510
a very curious value proposal that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.690
what it does is rent space

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.450
on private jets for large

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.330
corporations.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.830
Therefore, it has segmented only large

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.750
corporations, which are, mainly their

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.630
customers are large corporations,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.770
and in addition it differentiates,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.290
the competitive advantage you are looking

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.010
for is differentiation, right?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.470
Customers choose NetJets by value.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.210
Well, as we have said before,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.550
the key to generic strategies is

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.150
that they allow us to choose,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.550
and companies have to make

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.690
decisions and have to be

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.050
brave and committed to the decisions

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.170
they make.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.430
And what happens, and happens

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.950
too often, is that there are many

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.090
companies that, not having this clear,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.910
in the end what they do is, as they

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.230
call it in English, stacking in

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.310
the middle, they stay in the middle,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.310
they are not, they are not looking

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.410
to be the leaders in cost, nor are they

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.970
really focused on offering differentiation,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.250
etc., and they stay in

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.050
the middle.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.690
And what they get, in the end, the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.670
consequence is that they have, instead

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.710
of a competitive advantage, they have

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.030
a competitive disadvantage, because

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.770
they compete in a market where

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.790
some customers choose the cheapest,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.250
other customers choose the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.390
best and they are in the middle.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.210
And I'm going to use an expression

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.610
I've heard several times in the mouth

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.990
of Víctor Costa, who was one of

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.130
his companions and had the luck

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.950
to learn a lot of things from him.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.850
He used the term shock.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.630
I think it is very representative of this.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.810
We saw many companies that, in the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.870
end, what happened was that

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.010
they were, with what we said,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.550
stacking in the middle, had not

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.190
decided, had no clear what their

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.750
strategy was and offered

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.370
neither chocolate nor chili.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.450
And what they offered was shock,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.550
which is a scorn.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.790
And, at the end of the day, no one buys

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.150
them because they have a disadvantage,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.070
right?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.930
Let us make a final summary.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.330
The Maiker Porter model of

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.850
generic strategies helps us

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.210
make decisions, helps us choose

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.950
whether we will compete trying

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.430
to be the cost leaders, that

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.250
is, have the production cost

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.150
lower than the rest, which

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.190
allows us to have higher margins.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.970
Or to reduce prices and

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.870
gain market share.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.810
We have to decide whether we want to

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.030
be the best in something.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.270
Or we can also choose to

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.830
focus on one of the niches or

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.830
one of the segments within

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.190
the market, establish closer

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.810
rations with that niche and

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.890
try to better meet your needs

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.090
exactly because we

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.230
are focused on it.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.530
The point is that you have to choose.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.030
And we have to make a decision, we

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.350
have to commit to that decision,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.310
because the entire management

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.610
of the company, the business

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.190
model, etc., will be affected

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.930
by that decision that we take.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.790
This is what we will see in the next class.
