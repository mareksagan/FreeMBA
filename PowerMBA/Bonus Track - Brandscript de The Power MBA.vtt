00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
We are going to create the story of The Power MBA using the Storybrand model.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I am going to remind you of the main objective.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
The main objective is to transmit in the easiest, easiest and most entertaining way to our clients

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
throughout all the different communications, the web, emails, etc.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
that we are here to help them and to make their life better.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
That is what has to transcend absolutely all the stories.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
And that is what this model helps us a lot.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's start.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
We start with the first of the chapters, which is the protagonist.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Who is the protagonist?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
The protagonist is our potential client.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
All that person who comes into contact at some point with The Power MBA through different impacts.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
We, I have to say that we have made the mistake on many occasions of becoming us in the protagonist

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
and talking about us, talking about founding partners, success cases, etc.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
The method, that is an excessively product-centric approach and that message fits inside the story.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
But later, we will see when.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
The important thing is that in each of the contacts you have with your clients,

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
in the story, the protagonist always, the client always feels the protagonist.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Always perceive that you are talking about him, that you care about him.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
And the first exercise we have to do here is to identify what is the desire,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
the main desire of the protagonist.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Why? Because if you are able to identify it and you start the story like that,

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
the protagonist will feel, well, that, he will feel being identified with that story.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
He will hook the story.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
You are going to open his, you are going to generate interest.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Let's see what is the main desire of the protagonist in the case of The Power MBA.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And we thought it was learning, that was to become an expert in the business world.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
But we really have to go to more basic, more primitive desires.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
People, what moves us are more basic things.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And learning is a means.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Deep down, a protagonist, when the protagonist in our story,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
what he wants is to improve his professional life.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
What he wants is to be more successful.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Success can mean different things depending on each person.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
It can mean making more money, it can mean growing in his company,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
it can mean setting up a company that goes well for him.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It can mean having economic freedom,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
it can mean dedicating yourself to something that every day, something that he is passionate about.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Success is very relative.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
That is, it is a concept that for each person means a different thing.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
But that is what the protagonist in this story is looking for.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
What he wants is more success.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And we have to be there to help him get it.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
What happens is that the protagonist has a problem.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And the first thing we are going to do is identify what the villain is,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
what is the cause of the protagonist's problems.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It helps a lot, because that way you personalize it.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And you already have someone to blame.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And the villain in this case is the current training offer.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It is the traditional programs, the MBAs or the traditional masters,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
which cost a lot of money,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
which are also designed for you to spend a lot of time, etc.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
That is the cause.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
That is the villain.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And now we are going to identify the protagonist's problems.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
What problems does he have?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And here I am going to make an assessment.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
There are external problems and internal problems.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
External problems are the objective facts.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
You will understand better when we put the example.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And internal problems are the feelings that generate,

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
the frustrations that generate those external problems in the protagonist.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
And a very valuable perception is the fact that companies

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
usually dedicate ourselves to solving external problems.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Our products and services are designed for that.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
However, customers do not buy us for that.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Customers buy us because they want to solve their internal problems.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So if we are able to identify the real problems of the customers,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
which are the internal ones,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
which are the feelings that generate those problems,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
then we will sell much more.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
We will enter like a knife.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
What are the external problems?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
The external problems of the protagonist of our story

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
is that, well, he does not have enough training,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
he does not have very up-to-date knowledge,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
or not up-to-date enough.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And he does not have the time, nor does he want to invest the money,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
whether he has it or not, in a program of the traditional ones.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
That is the problem, the main problem of our customers.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And we solve that problem.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
But what are the real internal problems that our customers feel?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, it's a kind of frustration or ambition

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
for not having managed, in many cases, to have a professional life

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
that allows them to do whatever they want,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
have enough economic freedom, etc.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And on the other hand, it is a concern perhaps for not having done enough

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
in terms of acquiring the tools that allow them to achieve the previous point,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
or manage their company better, or grow professionally.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Those are the internal problems.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
That is what really motivates people to acquire a training program.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And at this point, what we have to do is,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
since we have identified the problems of the protagonist,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
we have to position ourselves as a help, as a guide,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
that will help the protagonist to overcome his problems.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And it is a challenge to become a guide.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And you have to do it through two levers.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
One, showing empathy.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And two, positioning yourself as a figure who has enough authority

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
to help him solve those problems.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
How have we shown empathy in our case?

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, in all the messages we have talked about democratizing higher education

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
and also making it accessible to people who are very busy.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
All this shows a lot of empathy because it is very directed to the problems,

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
to the limitations, to the barriers with which the protagonist has found himself so far.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And how have we generated authority?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, we have generated authority from the beginning

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
because the company is created by founding members who are recognized.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So you position yourself as a figure of certain authority.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And now that we have students,

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
what we do is use the references of hundreds of students,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
of thousands of happy and satisfied students,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
and put it into value.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And that generates a lot of authority

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
because you are showing that you have been able to help others,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
and also others who have good jobs, etc.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And we also use the usual tactics

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
such as promoting all the media that talk about Power MBA on the website.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It is a very common tactic.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
What happens at this point in the story is that the protagonist already knows that we can help him,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
he has validated Power MBA,

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
but he has a lot of doubts because he perceives that his problems are very big

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
and that they do not have an easy solution.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And how are these guys going to get there and help me solve these problems?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It is the abyss we always talk about.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So here what we have to do is create a plan.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
We have to create a plan in which we are showing exactly the steps that we are going to take together

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
to solve these problems.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And that will give you a lot of comfort.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And what we have done is define our method and advertise it,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and explain it to everyone who asks,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
or explain it on the website.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
We could do it better.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Basically, the plan in our case is to describe how the classes are,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
in a 15-20 minute method per day,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that there are webinars, etc.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It is to explain what we are going to do.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
In each company it is different.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
In our case it is like this.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And at this point,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
in which the protagonist already knows what the path is,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
he has already validated you,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
you have helped him to visualize the problems, etc.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But we have to help him make the decision.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because people do not make the decision just like that.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And this is where we talk about the call to action.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
And at this point,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
what we have to be clear is that there are basically two types of call to action.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
There are more direct call to actions,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
and there are more transitional call to actions.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
They are the two types that are used by almost all companies.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
In our case, the direct call to action is,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
sign up now.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And the transitional,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
what we do is offer it,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
if you do not want to sign up today because you still do not know us enough,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
what we are going to do is,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
we give you three free classes.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
We will accompany you for a few days, but that's it.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Later, what we are going to offer you is to buy now.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Because as we always say,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
you do not have to be afraid of this,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
because your product is born to solve the problems of customers.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And customers often do not make the decision because yes,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
therefore you do not have to be afraid to repeat it.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And we come to the end of the story.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
And here,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
once we have already asked him to make the decision,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
really the important thing,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
what will motivate the protagonist to make that decision,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
to join Power MBA or not join,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
is that we are able to show our protagonist

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
what is being played depending on whether he makes the decision or not.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
How is he going to change his life in one way or another?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
This is the real motivator.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
So, what is used to make the protagonist see

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
how we are going to help him,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
is in negative and positive.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
On the one hand, what we can help him to visualize is the...

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
What are we going to avoid that happens if you make the decision?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, what we are going to avoid that happens is that you stay out,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
that you are outdated, that you lose things.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
We do not use these arguments, but they fit perfectly.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And also, be very clear that if you can use them in your case,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
they are very powerful,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
because we are more motivated to make decisions to avoid problems

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
than to get benefits.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And on the other hand, there is the happy ending.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
We have to show him what he is going to achieve,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
how he is going to change his life if he makes the decision.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
This is the biggest motivator of all.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
What is he going to achieve?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And we have to be as clear as possible

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
in describing the specific benefits,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and they have to be benefits that really matter.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You are not thinking about your product.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
You do the exercise and you do not think about the characteristics of your product.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
The benefits are the personal and basic benefits for the protagonist,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
which is what is really going to move him to make that decision that we want him to make.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
And what are they?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, we have talked about them before.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
It is having a more full professional life,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
dedicate himself to what he likes,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
grow within his company, create a company,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
manage his own better, earn more money, etc.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
These are the benefits, that happy ending, that photo finish

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
that you have to do permanently,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
to make the protagonist see it,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
because that is where we want to get.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Well, we have already seen, we have already worked

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
absolutely the whole story of PowerMV.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
What we have left now,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
that we have not done yet,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
is to sit down with the whole team,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
with the CMO,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
with those responsible for contracting campaigns on social networks,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
with those responsible for...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
with the community managers, etc.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Because the whole organization has to know the history of PowerMV,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
the history of our protagonists,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
which are potential clients.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And absolutely all text, all post, all announcement,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
all copy has to come out of this story that we have drawn today.
