00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.770
Silvia what about?

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.370
How are you?

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.490
Well, very much thanks.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.410
We've heard a thousand times about SEM,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.910
but I really think there are few

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.970
people who understand exactly what

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.710
it consists of.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.190
Okay, so let's do it simple.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.250
SEM is Search Engine Marketing.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.770
We also talk about SEA, Search Engine

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.190
Advertising.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.910
And in Christian is all advertising

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.730
in search engines.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.630
There are two main search

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.650
engines in the world, Google and Bing.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.450
How much more or less

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.570
Google searches?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.930
Depends on who you ask.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.730
But more or less of what we notice in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.670
customers, between a 90 and 95 percent

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.310
is Google and the rest is Bing.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.810
One important point is that

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.730
Bing users usually have

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.410
a higher conversion ratio,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.510
but we'll see it later.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.890
SEM is the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.770
activity that allows

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.350
you to respond

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.490
advertising to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.690
user searches.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
These are three elements

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.370
in search engines, directly

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.910
on the Google or Bing search

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.890
results pages.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.750
It is a paid activity, which is paid

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.050
per click.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.550
We are talking about PPC or CPC models,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.450
cost per click.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.790
And third, the goal is to correctly

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.350
respond to the search with

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.990
an ad and generate traffic

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.970
to a web page.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.410
When a user in a search engine,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.910
mainly Google, makes a search,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.870
we will use an example of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.290
Sastre Madrid or Dress Measure

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.030
Madrid.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.030
There are companies that pay

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.630
for coming out.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.590
And they appear, when we look at

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.530
the computer, in the first four links,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.110
they appear with an ad that consists

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.270
of two titles of 30 characters

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.510
and a description of 80.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.350
And then every time the user who

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.250
is browsing Google clicks on

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.510
that ad, the company that has

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.130
hired that ad pays for that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.590
click.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.570
actually is.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.290
And it's easy to understand this, but

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.350
how much do you pay or based on what you pay?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.290
Payment is based on three criteria.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.250
First, it only pays if the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.870
user clicks.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.650
That is fundamental.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.590
You don't pay to appear.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.490
Second, it is a market of supply and demand.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.910
That is, that there are searches,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.870
keywords, that have more or

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.390
less search volume.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.990
This affects the cost that will

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.290
be paid.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.190
And third point, there are more or

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.470
less advertisers who want to appear

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.990
there too.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.390
If you want to appear in a search

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570
where there are a lot of companies

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.530
willing to pay a lot of money for

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.190
being, then the auction will be more

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.630
expensive the click.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.370
actually is.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.950
The minimum price is one euro.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.830
In Spain, it is at least one hundred

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.370
euros.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.010
That is the minimum price.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.810
There are keywords that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.590
can cost 10 or 12 euros.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.110
It is a world of trading and auction

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.630
according to a number of algorithms

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.830
and key points to consider.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.250
well is.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.490
So, to finish, how is it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.590
used to hire this?

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.870
It is contracted in the case of Google

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.810
through the Google AdWords platform,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.230
which is a free-to-access

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.830
platform.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.650
You need to have a Google

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.010
account and possibly a

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.910
credit card.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.170
well is.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.490
I will explain that in Google

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.550
AdWords what you were talking about

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.850
the auction, when you select the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.030
words or searches where you want

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.250
to appear and basically informs

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.990
you of the rank.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.590
It gives you a first idea.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.350
Google gives you many tools and one

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.610
of them allows you to see a little

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.310
the volume that there is of this search.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.490
It even gives you keyword ideas

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.370
and more or less what level of

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.170
competition we are at.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.770
A lot of competition, little

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.790
competition and an idea of the auction

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.210
he would recommend.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.730
Google recommends it.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.730
You have to be a little careful.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.370
But it is to have a first idea

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.690
and allows you to make estimates

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.230
of budget and eventual cost.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.930
and Genius.
