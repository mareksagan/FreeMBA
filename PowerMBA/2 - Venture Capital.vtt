00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.900
Javier, I would love to

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.380
explain to Power MBA students what

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.600
a venture capital consists

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.340
of and how your business is.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.340
I will try to explain

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.960
it as quickly and easily as

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.820
possible, because it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.380
is not easy.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.820
Venture capital, which there

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.680
is no such term in Spanish

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.900
that defines it, is a high-risk

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.120
investment.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.940
And so, it is very much identified

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.960
what is venture capital with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.480
investments in technology

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.820
companies, but there are also

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.720
venture capitalists who invest

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.000
in other sectors, how can biotechnology

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.720
be, how can industrial technology

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.560
be, but what has to be

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.260
developed, etc.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.920
What happens is that really

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.220
what is most known about VCs,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.700
venture capitalists or venture

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.820
capital funds are investments

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.380
in technology companies.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.200
So within that sector there

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.040
are funds that specialize

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880
either sectorally and only

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.560
invest in certain areas

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920
or business models.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.480
There are others more cross-sectional,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.000
such as ours, and then there are funds

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.360
that specialize according to

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.840
the size of the investment and the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.080
stage in which the company is

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.820
located.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.180
So, within the venture capital funds

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.020
you have the SIDs, which is seed

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.900
in Spanish, basically when

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.560
there is virtually nothing, early

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.500
stage or initial phases when there

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.680
begins to be something, but you

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.500
are funding a little the development

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.120
still of the company, then you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.960
have the growth, and here there

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.600
is already a validated model,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.460
we will do a global expansion or

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.020
whatever.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.200
And depending on those phases,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.300
the volumes invested by

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.180
investors are one or the other.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
Logically, in SID the sizes

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.380
are smaller and as the company

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.760
grows or the investment

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.800
needs rise, because

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.880
they are much larger

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880
investment sizes.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.020
How much of the companies are

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.980
you usually buying?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440
This is the difference

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.140
between venture capital

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.480
and private equity.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.580
Venture capital, usually,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.360
takes always minority shares

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.920
with percentages that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.440
usually go between 5 and 25 per

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.340
cent per investor.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.180
Then what happens is that there

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.760
are many companies that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.220
are accumulating investors as they

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.100
are making funding rounds

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.380
and therefore the company’

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.880
s capital in the hands of the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.240
set of investors ends up being

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.980
70 or 80 or 90 or 50, but it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.100
doesn’t mean that there is an

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.340
investor who has that...

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.180
In other words, you would

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.280
be able to channel the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.400
investment of different...

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.440
No, it’s not that, but it’s not an

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.480
investment that is made at a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.180
given time and then never again.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.300
Before you enter, by making a little

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.020
history, you go with an idea and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.940
you tell it first to your friends,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.500
family or Business Angels and those

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.720
put you for putting a figure

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.540
in total 100,000 euros and those

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.840
100,000 euros represent maybe

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.340
a 10% of the company, but each

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.100
individual one has the 2,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.760
the other the 3, one the 1.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.720
Then you put that in place and you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.740
are already looking for another type

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.340
of financing and you get a venture

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.120
capital fund, early stage, and maybe

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.320
put you a million euros.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.960
In exchange for that, the money

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.340
is 15%.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.700
Well, you already have the 10

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.320
of the first round plus the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.380
15, but we do not channel the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.660
initial investment, but as

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.060
you make the team round, the entrepreneurs

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.160
are giving up part of the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.840
capital for that money that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.040
is coming in.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.900
And that, as you go round,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.780
what it means is that investors

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.100
end up controlling depending

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.680
on each...

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.840
Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, did

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.500
it very well and controls

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.180
the majority, but usually,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.400
as investors enter, entrepreneurs

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.520
go down their stake.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.060
But that’s why I told you that individually

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.720
we are looking for, for example,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.660
20%, more or less.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.600
Is there any objective profitability?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.580
I understand it depends on the stage

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.220
you enter, the risk, but...

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.780
Yes, we look at profitability

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.160
as a fund as a whole because

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.400
as funds work, they are closed

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.320
funds, that means that we

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.180
receive investment

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.560
commitment from investors

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680
to invest that money

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.340
in a certain period of time,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.780
which is usually four

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.060
or five years.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.280
And then, and that’s called an investment

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.740
period, the investment period closes

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.520
and we have another similar

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.100
four or five-year period to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.480
return that money we’ve invested

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.020
plus the expected return.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.000
So, in our sector, what is expected

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.840
is to return around three

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.460
times the money.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.840
That means that a fund of 40 million

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.640
euros is what you expect is to make

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.060
investments and de-investments

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.340
for 120 million euros to be able

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.720
to return the 40 that have given

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.280
you more than another 80.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.720
I understand that by the type

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.740
of investment you make, of very high

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.780
risk, in some investments...

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.860
Well, that I think is an axiom that

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.720
is not entirely true and that is identified

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.780
venture capital with high risk

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.700
and within the highest risk

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.300
there are many people who

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.560
say this is binary or you lose everything

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.560
or this you multiply

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.520
by a thousand.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.960
I think it is not so either.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.080
We logically seek to generate

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.460
a return on our investments

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.300
of 10 times the volume invested.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.640
Why is?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.120
There are many others that will

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.920
be left on the way.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.160
And the average, in the end, takes

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.380
you to the total bottom half of the target 3.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.100
But initially when we invested

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.600
we don’t think that it will

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.080
generate a return of 3x or 2x

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.580
or 4x, but of 10 or 15 or 20x.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.940
Why is?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.400
Because many are left on the road

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.660
and the 10 are left on 3 and others

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.780
are left on 0, others simply

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.720
return the capital, etc.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.760
But I mean, it’s not binary.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.480


00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.980
For example, in our first fund

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.100
that we invested in 31 companies

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.760
with a volume of investment,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.580
after 5 years, only 18% have been

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.360
failed investments.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.560
The binary would take you almost to 1-0

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.480
and the average would be at 50%.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.100
Why is?

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.720
Because there are simply investments

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.520
that what they don’t do is get

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.620
to have the behavior you expected

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.880
and get the returns you

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.340
expected, but it doesn’

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.320
t mean they close.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.620
They can become profitable

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.780
companies.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.420
Yes, they are profitable companies

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.440
where you don’t end up selling them

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.360
for what you expected, but you end

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.320
up selling them and you end up getting

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.360
your money back or once and a

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.320
half or twice.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.800
Do you prefer a particular

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.200
business model or a vertical

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.720
one?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.700
We are, of course, specializing

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.960
in digital technology.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.080


00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.500
As I said before, there is a different kind of technology.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.280
There is technology, there is

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.520
technology, there is technology.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.240
Our is digital technology,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.880
which is quite broad and

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.080
are B2C and B2B models,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.360
that is, consumer-focused,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.500
business-focused.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.940
And within that in turn there

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.400
are a lot of subsectors or branches.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.700
Do you prefer a marketplace?

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.020
No to.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.580
What do you look for in a company?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.080
Because in the end the key to a successful

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.300
business is to have enough criteria

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.300
to choose well where you are.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.020
That is the most difficult thing.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.560
We have invested in 46 companies

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.680
in the last five years, but

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.840
we’ve seen more than 4,000 between

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.440
4,000 and 5,000, so you’re

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.240
investing in 1% of the things

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.160
you see.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.460
That’s what gives you, especially

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.780
in the initial phases, that is where

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.120
we invest, there is a lot of

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.800
subjectivity when analyzing investments,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.080
basically because there

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.040
is no history.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.960
It is that in the last three years I

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.020
have achieved this, that we have invested

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.320
in companies that have that

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320
history and that we may have

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.520
entered when they already have four

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.400
or five years of history, but others

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.160
may have six months.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.140
So, basically, we all look

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.720
at a little bit what

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.520
the technology is, what they

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.080
want to solve.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.960
Is it a problem that many people

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.620
have or is it a problem that you have

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.640
or that I have?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.740
If it’s a problem I have, there are

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.740
probably very few people who have

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.440
that problem.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.020
So we try to see what they

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.140
are trying to solve.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.900
In the learning course, one of the

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.980
lessons is how to validate that

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.180
there is actually a problem that

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.740
is the biggest and that people

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.080
are willing to pay for that

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.560
problem.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.700
And then, you have already come

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.120
to that conclusion, with the technology

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.160
that this company has, how

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.100
can that be solved?

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.340
Or really help and there you see

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.300
entrance barriers.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.300
I would tell you the size of the market.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.180
You say, this is milk, because

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.160
this solves this problem, and

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.860
it is also a problem that has

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.000
a billion or that has

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.160
a lot of millions of people.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.420
The size of the market is becoming more and more

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.440
complicated, isn’t it?

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.460
Yes, because every time you

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.900
get a presentation from some

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.000
company, the market size is

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.880
always at least 120 billion

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.120
U.S. dollars.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.280
I think it’s a bit relevant...

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.080
The size of the market I say because

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.640
there are companies, for example, we

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.980
have been targeting what we

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.080
call non-customers.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.520
It is a market that has not yet

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.040
existed, which we are creating.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.860
There are many companies like that.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.460
The other day I spoke with...

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.140
But that is different, isn’t it?

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.180
There is a lot of talk about artificial

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.120
intelligence.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.960
We are investing in companies

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.100
with a high component of artificial

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.460
intelligence.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.800
What does that mean?

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.340
Machine learning is based

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.540
on the information

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.480
it generates.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.080
But artificial intelligence, the

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.680
first contact we all had, and

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.540
there will be young people who don’

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.880
t remember, but Tom Cruise’s

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.640
Minority Report film was based

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.740
on artificial intelligence

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.880
concepts, didn’t it?

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.840
How many have passed?

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.300
20 years of this movie.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.220
What is now being seen are real

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.920
applications to current needs

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.800
based on artificial intelligence

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.700
and machine learning.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.150
What there is is simply...

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.190
Whatever you say about the size of

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.750
the market, the market is there.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.250
What is happening is a change in

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.410
the way things are done.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.370
Yes, but sometimes what is clear is

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.190
that when the problem is big,

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.910
it has a lot of people and people

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.790
are willing to pay for it, because

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.410
you have the solution,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.530
because you chose the solution,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.930
but we find it complicated

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.170
sometimes to estimate the size

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.970
of the market, quantify

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.510
it in the markets in which

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.330
you are...

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.270
What happens is that they are very different

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.590
business models, because once I’

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.050
m going to set up a Facebook that

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.150
really isn’t a necessity.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.630
Before Facebook existed, what

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.210
was the Facebook market?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.070
I don’t know, because people don’t

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.770
have that need.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.810
And another example is the models

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.850
that do digitize existing economies.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.350
You can estimate the size of the

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.010
market.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.110
For example, we have invested

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.190
in a company that facilitates

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.370
the online hiring

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.870
of containers,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.070
containers for ships.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.390
Then you can estimate the size

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.930
of the world’s container industry,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.270
because that’s known, there are ships

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:21.930
that carry containers from one

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.030
site to another.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.010
Why is it interesting?

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.430
Because that is a very offline

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.990
market, where you contract by

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.210
phone, fax, mail, tardan

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.970
and so on.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.950
Our main investment is the digitalization

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.070
of the industry.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.650
How much of what is currently available

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.710
offline can be purchased

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.570
online?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.570
How can you buy?

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.470
To make an idea, it is very similar

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.510
to what happened to the...

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.230
People now don’t think of going

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.610
to a travel agency to

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.830
buy a plane ticket.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.530
But it’s that before you had to go

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.230
to a travel agency to hire a plane

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.270
ticket and they didn’t sell it

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.030
to you at the time.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.890
I told you, now I call you.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.390
And they called you for three days and

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.890
said, 120,000 pesetas.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.850
And, I know, but that is very expensive.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.330
Oh, so wait, because maybe I get one

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.910
that goes way I don’t know where.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.210
At four o’clock, they called again.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.130
If it was Saturday, they would not call

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.670
you until Monday or Tuesday.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.110
Today that is unthinkable.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.970
You got a ticket, you put it on

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.950
any website and you buy it.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.170
In these areas, the

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.810
size of the market

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.370
is very clear.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.130
What is the value that technology offers?

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.130
In this case it is awesome, isn’t it?

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:33.830
It is undoubted.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.950
There are others who do, and there

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.250
are those who are going to be.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.390
Everything that has to do with cybersecurity.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.310
Logically, as more and more

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.530
information is being managed,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.990
or managed virtually, solutions

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.410
must appear to protect against

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.030
that, right?

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.790
A few years ago, it was not, because the

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.650
volume was much smaller.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.490
Or anything that has to do with

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.150
cloud-based technologies.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.830
There was no cloud.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.410
Now there are other things that

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.350
you say, what is the size?

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.450
I know what the size is today, but

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.170
that has a brutal growth.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.070
And if there are people who are dedicated

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.490
to doing research and understanding

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.770
what the evolution of the size

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.990
of the market is, that is, today

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.430
it is a market of 20 billion, but

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.510
it is growing to a 30% annual and

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.090
will be a market of 50,000 in

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.810
2025, to put an example.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.810
Have you had any success

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.890
cases from a company you

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.370
entered, you left, or have

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.710
you been known?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.590
In well-known companies, the

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.370
most popular ones are those used

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.030
by the consumer, the most.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.570
We invest more in B2B,

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.810
so we know less.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.570
I think we have a very interesting

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.390
portfolio of companies that have

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.930
had much success by the evolution

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.310
of their own business model, by

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.390
the type of investor that has

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.070
entered, very international,

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.570
from a Jovan Talent that

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.370
manages everything called

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.390
Blue Collar.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.630
Yes, Jovan Talent is one of the

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.450
cases of Power M.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.590
It’s an example of a company we entered

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.510
five years ago, when they were

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:28.790
very small, they were only nine

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.930
employees, now they are 200

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.150
and peak, and they are in Spain,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.790
Colombia, Mexico, UK, Germany,

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.390
Sweden, etc.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.070
We analyzed how they pivoted

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.090
the business model and from there

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.130
things are...

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.550
To make you an idea, our business

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.850
model implies being in the companies

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.250
a measure of seven years, with

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.330
which we have finished the investment

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.290
phase and we are now in the

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.730
consolidation and de-

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:57.270
investment phase, they will come.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.290
Do you bring, finally, to the companies,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.430
in addition to the financing

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.610
they need in the expansion,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.070
synergies are generated between

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.370
the companies and you?

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.350
Well, we are just there in the

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.370
Jovan Talent council and after the

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.310
council we are talking about a few

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.230
topics, the synergies there is

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.670
brutal what is.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.810
And in addition, as they are companies

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.550
with a very open mindset,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.130
they don’t care that it’s another

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.210
startup with which they

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.050
provide a service and hire

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.770
them for things, which is a

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.610
bit different from the big company

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.590
that often will cost them

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.910
to hire a startup so that

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.170
they do anything.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.790
Here I see if it depends on whether there

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.390
is a lot of difference between investors

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.970
and all models are equally valid, I

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.330
invest, I know nothing about your

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.490
sector, I don’t want to know anything

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.710
about your sector and also don’t call me.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.550
We are a little different in that

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.150
sense, we have a team, I would say,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.410
the largest in relative terms

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.630
in this sector and we are involved

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.570
a lot in the companies, we help

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.830
them a little to generate those

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.510
synergies in the commercial part

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.630
to facilitate leads from potential

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.170
customers.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.870
If you tell me that you participate

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.550
in the experience you have,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:20.470
having participated in, I imagine

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.590
that it is very enriching

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.290
what you can contribute in

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.770
the advice you told me yesterday.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.090


00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.290
At the end it is experience that is accumulating

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.130
and you learn, where less you learn

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.230
is of the things that are always good

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.190
and you learn a lot of those that have

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.090
gone through difficulties or

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.810
go wrong or have gone wrong and that

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.650
at the end the conclusion is that

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.870
it helps save a lot of money

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.830
and a lot of time to the companies.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.990
In the end, it is possible

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.610
to add that.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.170
Thank you very much, it has

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.890
been a pleasure and a great

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.210
enrichment for our students.
