WEBVTT

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.810
We have already seen what our

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.190
future is, what our vision is.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.250
We have set very clear goals

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.550
with the airport test.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.250
In addition, we have made a journey

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.170
back to the past because it is very

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.370
important that we make the effort

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.750
to know ourselves very well and what

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.730
we have done is to identify

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.650
the most relevant experiences in

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.250
our lives and have analyzed them.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.850
We are now more aware

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.710
of our strengths,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.830
of our analysis from

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.630
a different perspective.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.430
In this case, we will not analyze

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190
ourselves, but we will support

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.830
ourselves in people who know us.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.470
That is.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.830
How will we do it?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.250
Look, this can be called the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.030
shark test and this has been

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.850
taken from a television

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.930
program in the United States

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.990
called Shark Tank, where there

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.030
were entrepreneurs who had

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.210
a business idea and tried to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.530
convince investors to invest

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.910
in that business idea.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.990
Now we see how it relates

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.710
to exercise.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.110
In Spain there has been a similar

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.870
program called Your Opportunity,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.970
which some will know,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270
where it was also done the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.710
same.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.110
Why do I tell the Shark

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.510
Tank test?

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.030
Because it really was being

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.090
judged by others.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.810
That is, it was others who decided whether

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.750
my business idea was good or bad

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.990
regular, whether it was worth investing

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.130
in it or not.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.590
In this case, we will use

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.610
it, they are people who know

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.970
us and who normally love

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.350
us well.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.450
We're not just going to ask an enemy

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.650
because that in the end the result

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.510
is bad.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.770
And we will ask them to tell

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.490
us what our superpowers are,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.030
our strengths, our weaknesses,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550
what motivates us,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.670
what doesn't, what annoys

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.630
us.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.830
We will try to get them to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.630
explain us, to identify us.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.690
These, what we call

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.070
superpowers, are those things

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.190
we are in, which makes us special.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.390
And why will we do this?

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.070
Because often the analysis we

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.950
do of ourselves is misguided or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.730
sometimes we don't give importance

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.710
to things that have it.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.710
I remember the case of a person who was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.730
very good organizing, for example, trips

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.530
between friends and him, for him, as

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.990
it was something natural didn't give

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.510
him any importance and thought that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.250
it wasn't a quality of him, that he

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.790
could exploit in another area, in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.670
the professional field.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.610
And it was when the others told him,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.710
when he realized, it is true,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.670
I am very good at organizing,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.050
I am very good at planning,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.550
I am very good at putting a plan,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.710
putting people in agreement

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.050
and executing that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.430
plan.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.830
It is a competition that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.250
you can perfectly, professionally,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.830
get a lot out of.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.050
Yes, but he was not conscious.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.430
If you asked him what you are

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.870
good at, he't have answered that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.990
characteristic naturally.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.150
The journey back to the past we

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.670
have made before has identified

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.910
some qualities, some strengths

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.190
and maybe left out others

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.950
that are out of the radar.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.670
And now we'll put them under the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.310
focus by asking the others.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.370
How will we do it?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.810
The shark test is a test

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.890
that consists of sending

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.590
an email to at least

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.530
10 people who know

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.230
us well.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.690
It can be personal or professional,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.610
or a mix.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.470
They don't have to be just one or just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.990
another.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.570
I will also propose an email

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.030
text so that people can use it.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.690
Then they adapt it to what they feel

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.610
more comfortable with.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.830
Let us leave the text.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.110
actually is.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.730
And the text, well, the matter

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.410
would say, friend, help me

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.050
to identify my superpowers, which is

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.650
also a type of information and although

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.670
they will be friends and they will

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.030
know us and in any case they will

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.530
answer us, if we put this title

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.190
because it will also generate, it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.670
will give rise to debate and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.990
curiosity as we ask you hear,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.070
what is this?

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.430
And they will be able to answer.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.830
Then I would say, dear friend or

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.310
friend, I am working on developing

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.810
my personal brand and for that,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.750
since you are one of the people

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.990
who know me best, I ask you for

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.770
help to identify me all

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.110
that in your opinion makes

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.830
me different from others,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.370
makes me special.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.450
To make it easier, if you had

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.750
to say what my superpower is,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.450
what would you say?

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.450
And then I say, although I'm sure

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.430
there are other things you don't

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.750
like about me, now I want to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.450
focus only on the positive, nothing

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.250
more.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.190
But I want to ask you to be totally

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.010
honest, that is, it's not worth saying,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.770
hear, how good you are, you're the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.410
best in everything, no, because otherwise

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.450
you won't help me.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.310
Thank you very much for your time and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.450
for accessing to help me, it is

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.730
very important for me and I will

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.730
already go commenting on my

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.190
advances, it is important then to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.730
share with people what the result

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.090
you have had.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.710
A hug, your name, sign and

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.230
send it.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.910
If they are 10 perfect, if they are

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.270
better, the wider the sample, the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.130
better, because it will give us

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.370
more information about us.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.050
And once we have done this and received

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.450
the answers, what we have to do logically

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.410
is contrast it with all the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.610
information we have obtained

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.830
from the previous exercises, with

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.490
the airport test and with the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.750
trip back to the past, especially

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.870
with the trip back to the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.290
past.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.770
And in this way we will already

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.910
have a much wider picture, we will

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.090
have our vision and the vision

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.250
of people who know us to identify

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.230
strengths, weaknesses

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.470
and motivations.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.130
I love it, just to finish I will

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.590
advance something that I am sure happens

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.470
to a lot of people and it is that

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.830
it is embarrassing to send it.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.050
It is true, that is true.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.790
Then I just came up in the head

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.810
that what we can do is, the advice

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.770
we give is that you are justified

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.350
because you are doing Power

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.970
MBA.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.770
It is a very good idea, indeed.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.610
And within the MBA program, of

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.030
Power MBA, we are in a coaching

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.530
process in which I will

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.130
learn to know myself better

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.630
to define my professional

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.350
and vital goals, etc.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.530
And one of the tasks we are doing

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.630
is this and I would love if you

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.470
helped me.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.710
I say it because it's easier like

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.010
that, because you're justifiing that

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.350
as within a program and within

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.310
a methodology.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.250
It is right that sometimes people

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.730
are embarrassed and it is something

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.130
that we must overcome, because what

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.130
we are doing is to ask for a favor

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.150
from people who know us, who

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.050
can help us, but I understand

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.210
that there is that barrier and

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.070
it is the perfect justification.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.090
Of course, because it is no longer the happy

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.290
idea that I have put it on the internet

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.870
and so on.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.290
No, it is within a program.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.790
and exact.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.090
And thousands of people are doing it.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.970
And with a purpose, indeed.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.230
I am not looking for the virality

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.530
of sending, I am looking for it so

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.990
that people don't shame him.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.150
No, no, and I think it will be very

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.630
helpful.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.050
Obviously this exercise is not why

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.110
you should do it in writing, although

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.170
in writing I think it gives information

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.750
because it forces people to

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.390
structure the data of information

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.450
they will give about you.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.550
But you can also make an informal,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.850
social conversation of

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.330
any kind.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.790
But well, obviously it is better

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.430
to do this way because we

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.470
have structural information.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.410
I recommend that everyone do it because

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.330
it really leads you to surprises, it

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.570
strengthens you in things and it is

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.670
true that there are many times that

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.670
you have not read the weaknesses.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.910
That is the exercise we propose.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.330
Come on, it is all to do.
