WEBVTT

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.260
We are at the point where, regardless

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.480
of the tools we said, you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.080
told us the portals, educational

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.100
centers, the jeanners, the spontaneous

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.320
candidatures, the internal

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.580
or dynamic candidatures like

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.340
yours, that you attract people

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.780
on social networks and do experiences,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.140
regardless of that comes

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960
a time when you have candidates,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.040
many candidates in some cases

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.700
and I will transmit our

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.880
experience, is that you see

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.100
that you have, imagine,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.080
a hundred candidates in a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.600
mailbox, a hundred curriculum,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.080
and you have to devote

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.300
an effort in time and mental

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.260
effort to pass from

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.060
those hundred to hire

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.460
one, which is sometimes

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.620
overwhelming, then

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.040
we need a process.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.500
Exactly, it has to be a very structured

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.040
process just for that, to take it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.480
away that it is something overwhelming.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.900
So, clearly, what are the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.400
phases?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.200
You have an inbox with 400

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.400
curricula, then the job portals

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.880
allow you to get a first screw,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.940
you put a series of filters

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.080
and filter you from 800 candidates,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380
filter you 20 curricula,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.980
yet they are many.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.040
Then you do what you do is those

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.620
20 curricula, you do a crunch

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.480
your curriculum, see which one

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.000
is me and maybe imagine that you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.840
have 10.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.000
At the time you have 10, you have

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to contrast several things,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
first you have to call them,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.720
you have to make a phone

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.300
interview to contrast

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.340
several things.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.260
First the availability, because there

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.440
are times that maybe people have

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.800
applied and maybe the next day

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.980
or at the time their situation has

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.760
changed.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.000
Then you have to call them by phone

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.840
to these 10 people to contrast, first

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.960
the availability, second

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.060
that they are still interested in

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.260
the offer, because you may explain

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.840
them briefly the offer and maybe

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.580
some says, because it is that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.060
I thought it was in Madrid Capital,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.920
and no, no, it is that I do

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.060
not have availability to travel,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.720
then for this you have to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.520
make telephone interviews.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.280
These interviews are a first step,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.300
so my recommendation is that they

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.320
be as much as 15 minutes and half

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.580
an hour, where you effectively

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.040
contrast the candidate's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.900
availability, motivations and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.820
interests and place him in a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.120
face-to-face interview,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.080
which is the second phase of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.960
the process.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.000
Once you have made those short

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.420
phone interviews, you place

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.880
them in a face-to-face

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.080
way and you do an interview.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.860
Usually we advise that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.480
you do that interview with

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.080
the person you are reporting

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.460
to, because you gain efficiency.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.680
There is usually a human resource

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.380
person and another business person

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.200
in which for an hour or

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.240
two hours as much do the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.680
interview to the candidate.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.140
This is the second part of the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.520
process, the interviews.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.220
How many candidates are you interviewing

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.180
for more or less?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.640
Around 10 as much, between 5 and 10 candidates.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.020
Now we'll explain then how an interview

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.380
is done, but you interview 5

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.660
or 10 candidates and you make the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.520
decision, you choose the final

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.240
candidate.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.600
Once that is chosen with the business,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360
then you have a meeting with the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.560
manager and you say you make a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.880
brief report of all the candidates,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.360
of each one's strengths,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.020
like a daff of each of the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.940
candidates.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.300
And you make the decision.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.980
And then it's the final phase of the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.580
process that is, you call the candidate

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.360
to tell him that he has been the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.200
selected candidate and make

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.460
him the offer.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.820
And also manage the time limits for

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.960
incorporation, because if it is

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.340
a candidate who is working he

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.800
has to give a preaviso, also to manage

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.600
the time limits and that we do

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.640
not get the process.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.320
Because the process from when we

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.740
started to count it until we normally

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.500
finish it, depending

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.360
on the position, usually takes

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.540
a month.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.120
Between you receive candidatures,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.020
you make the shortlist, then the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.600
telephone interviews, then the face-

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.260
to-face and then you choose it, more

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.120
or less a month later.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.920
It also depends on the position

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.400
you are looking for, how specific it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.580
is, whether there are many people

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.600
with that profile of the market

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.380
and others.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.380
The concrete tips that we can apply,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.180
look at, that I have liked is,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.080
there are things that people who have

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.260
no experience, it is good to advance

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.080
it and it is that, you can

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.120
make maybe a longlist, you

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.820
will fall many.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
That is, don't give things,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.060
of course, because of that longlist

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.900
you have, there will be many who

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.480
have applied and already have

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.520
work, who have applied without

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.080
knowing.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.500
That when you tell him a little, they

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.360
will fall or that when they tell

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.560
you here, they will fall to you.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.560
So, it's ultra inefficient to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.240
get you interviewing your entire

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.440
longlist because you're doing it.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.480
Then you have to make a pre-

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.060
crypt, which helps a lot, that

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.080
can be done by phone.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.240
And it helps, then that longlist,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.880
because we take out pam pam pam pam

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.140
pam and we stay with 10, for example,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.940
between 5 and 10.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520
And then these yes, we call

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.400
them, we interview them, you have given

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.260
us guidelines to be more efficient,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.820
that here you have to look for efficiency

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.060
because all this consumes

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.280
very many resources.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.640
Don't do what has always

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.080
been done of, especially

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.120
large companies calling candidates,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.680
first human resources.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.600
Then it goes a lot of time and

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.540
then they call you business.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.500
You already have work.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.480
So, the human resources manager

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.760
has wasted time interviewing someone

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.720
who already has a job.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.960
That is, that has found work after,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.740
a maximum inefficiency.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.040
Human Resources in Business.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.820
If it is a very complicated process,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.240
then it is a second.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.960
That is, with certain, with the management

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.140
committee, for example, to make

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.180
decisions and more.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.720
You have to be very clear, the

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.400
first curricular crypt helps you

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.680
to the job portals.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.580
I think I'll pick out some, I know, from

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.160
20 to 200 candidates.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.180
Then, then you do a curriculum

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.540
that you contrast with a telephone

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.340
interview.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.720
Many of them will be caught up in

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.820
different situations that...

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.120
That is.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.860
That is, what you can't do

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.820
is, first, a shortlist, without

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.180
considering that many will

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.080
fall for you.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.560
That is.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.220
Because half of them are already...

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.620
When you make the shortlist,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.880
you've had to have made

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.340
a scheduled phone interview.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.320
Then, you're already getting a

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.840
shortlist that you interview in person.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.160
In this case, as I mentioned before,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.520
now there are a number of tools

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.560
on the market that allow you

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.020
to make a face-to-face interview

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.860
remotely.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.200
So, that is a more agile

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.140
or efficient tool to shorten

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.540
time in the process.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.600
In any case, the interview, whether

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.540
on-the-face or at a distance,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.560
must be given.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.020
And the same, for example, an hour or

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.760
two hour interview with someone in

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.660
the business.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.180
After that interview, you are already

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.420
out of business and you have a decision.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.580
Business and human resources with

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.700
a decision.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.500
Call the candidate to inform

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.100
him of the decision.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.980
This is important.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.440
Why is?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.120
Because if you let the candidate spend

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.940
a lot of time, it may have gone

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.080
out of work or anything, or they

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.220
have made a counter offer

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.560
or something else.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.380
So, also why it is important

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.220
to use all the tools that

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.260
are on the market to shorten time

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.820
and maximize the efficiency

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.340
and effectiveness of these

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.100
processes.
