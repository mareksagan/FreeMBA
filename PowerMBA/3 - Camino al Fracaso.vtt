00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.570
Let us do a brief analysis.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.730
What are the main causes

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.050
of startups death?

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.430
Because I think it sounds like this,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.630
I’ve heard it many times.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.130
If you have a good idea, if you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.730
have been able to identify an

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.070
opportunity in some existing

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.310
market or in a new market, you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.110
are surrounded by people, the right

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.350
people, you have a good team,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.070
you are at the right time,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.130
in the right place, we

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.610
also hear that many times.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.130
It’s very important, you have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.370
to do it with passion, with perseverance,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.510
you have to work hard, you

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.090
have to fight for that idea

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.090
you’ve had.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.010
You also have illusions.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.550
If you have all this, what is it that

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.350
they usually tell us?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.230
That it is a matter of time, that you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.630
will get to success, that you will succeed.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.750
But the reality is that this is a lie.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.070
And there is a data that corroborates

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.090
us and is that 90% of startups

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.290
die in that barbarity.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.750
And it’s also a real drama, because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.530
people leave their jobs, invest

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.730
their money, put a lot of illusion.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.090
Not just your money, but the money

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.510
of people around you, etc.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.290
Many people have everything we

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.950
have seen.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.890
They have a good idea, they are at the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.410
right time, they do it with passion,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.970
they work hard, they put all their

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.930
illusion in it and yet they

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.150
are part of that 90% of those who fail.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.590
Let’s see the survey, right?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.730
What it tells us is that 42% of

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.170
startups fail because there is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.450
no market need, there is no

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.770
need in the market for that product.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.630
And then there are other causes such as

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030
that you are without money, that it is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.830
not the right equipment, that there

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.850
are other competitors that outperform, etc.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.350
The product is not good.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.930
Well, these are a number

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.970
of circumstances that are

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.310
very common in all surveys.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.550
Let us go to this survey.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.590
And that’s what I want you to stay with.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.430
Look, look at what is the number

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
one cause of startups dying.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.830
They don’t die, they are almost not born.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.010
In this case, they are not able to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.670
build something that people

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.370
want to buy.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.750
This is the key, this is the idea

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.370
I want you to stay with.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.770
This is the main cause of the death

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.090
of startups, which never reach

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.710
the product market feed, which is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.950
a term, a concept that we will

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.170
study later and that you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.330
will learn well.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.430
Well, if this is the main

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830
reason for startups dying,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.250
what we have to be able to do

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.750
is develop a method that helps

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.410
us, with the least risk possible

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.150
and with the least investment

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.430
possible, build products

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.030
or services that people want

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.810
to buy.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.610
If not, we will die on the road.
