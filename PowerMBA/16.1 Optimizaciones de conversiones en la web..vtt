WEBVTT

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.460
Once we have already done a deep

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.120
analysis of the website and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.060
we can know what is working

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.240
for us, what we have to do

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.000
is to implement improvements.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.080
And as we implement improvements we

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180
have to go measuring the effect or

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.460
impact that these improvements

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.140
have on conversion ratios

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.200
or on these indicators that allow

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.680
us to measure the analytics as we

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.720
saw, such as the exit rate, bounce

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.280
rate, the time that users

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.900
spend on the web page, etc.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.820
We have a lot of metrics to monitor

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.040
whether we are on the right track

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.140
or not.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.620
The question here is, what can

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.340
we improve?

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.420
The list of things we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.920
could improve is endless.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.900
It is impossible to categorize.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.040
What you have to be clear is a bit

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.760
of the focus, that focus of permanently

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.000
looking, measuring, looking, measuring,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.260
looking, measuring.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.640
And what I'm going to share with

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.380
you is a number of things, a

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.400
number of things to keep

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.680
in mind and that simply having

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500
these in mind would improve

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.540
conversion rates

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.540
for almost every web

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.100
page.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.960
The first thing is that we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.540
always, always, always reinforce

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.000
this, is that in the end the most

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.300
important thing is to transmit

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.220
well your messages, transmit well

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.260
the benefit, position yourself

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.420
as someone who can help your

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.320
client, transmit trust, etc.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.340
Having the script we always

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.900
talk about that we recommend

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
support, that you support StoryBrand

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.340
in the course we have

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.840
given.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.980
I say this so that you take into account

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.000
because there are a lot of people who

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.940
are obsessed with the color of call to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.940
action, they are obsessed with things

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.260
that are important, more technical,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.720
more detail and it is fine, but it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.100
is that at the end we must always go

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.740
to the basics, we must always

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.400
go to understand the customer, to

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.760
transmit the proposal well, etc.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.380
Because that is what has the most impact.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.980
Let's go to more concrete advice,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.860
although by the way, giving advice

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.600
here is very dangerous because what

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.740
one can work for another does

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.080
not.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.680
What we're going to see are things

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.620
you have to take into account.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.080
The headline, for example.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.420
The But is important to be taken

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.420
into account, to be well understood,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.680
to be attractive, to generate

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.640
interest, etc.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.860
You can incorporate testimonials from

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.020
other customers or the brands of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.680
companies you've worked with,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.760
if we're talking about B2B, for example.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.500
It gives a lot of security.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
You can incorporate mentions of your

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.680
company in the media, it also generates

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.540
security, it helps a lot.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.480
It is important to work call to action.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.980
Where do we put the buttons?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.740
We put them here and there, they

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.180
are always very visible.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.520
In the call to action, you can

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.860
work on a lot of things.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.320
The number of call to actions.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.980
For example, if we put too many calls to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.980
actions, because the same thing you are

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.360
doing is to discourage them from clicking

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.920
on what you are interested in.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.500
The color.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.280
Many experiments have been made, for

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.400
example, from green to red and it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.740
results in an increase in conversions

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:23.160
of 60%, because in the pop up you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.080
do what you do is incorporate

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.240
a call to action.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.260
And after 10 seconds of browsing,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.800
the pop up appears and you try

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.480
to convert or generate a lead,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.440
for example.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.300
Or you can put an exit pop up, which

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.020
is when they will close the page, at

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.540
that moment you jump another pop up

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.220
with a different message.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.320
Another issue to consider

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.300
is optimizing the page to optimize

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.640
the page speed.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.520
It is measured that for every second

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.080
that passes since it takes time

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.260
to load the page, because conversions

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.280
decrease enormously.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.420
Another issue to consider is how

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.300
much content we incorporate, how

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.940
much text, more or less.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.580
And here there is no rule, because

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.940
I would tell you that if your product

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.240
is low-impact, it takes less text,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.740
it can be all more direct and with

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.740
photos, etc., because good, because

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.500
it is enough.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.280
If your product is a purchase

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.180
with a higher app, then I think

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.500
it is convenient to put more content.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.580
By the way, there are people who say,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.660
no, it is that they convert more

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.380
pages that have very little

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.720
content, very little text,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.120
etc., because you are not scratching.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.060
This sometimes applies, but it does

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.200
not always apply, that is, you can't say

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.280
rules like that.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.900
In many cases, there are pages that

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.340
have incorporated more content and

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.780
the conversion challenges have increased.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.480
Another issue to consider, because

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.720
the number of links you incorporate,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.580
whether you can browse a lot or not

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.320
inside the page, is that you have

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.500
to find the balance, because

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.400
it is true that if you, imagine,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.220
we take it to the extreme, you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460
only have a link, you only have

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.060
a call to action, you can

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.880
not browse.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.200
Well, you are leading the customer

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.140
to pin that call to action,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.080
but you are not giving enough

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.580
information to generate

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.780
confidence.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.940
So what you have to do is take

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.060
into account what I'm saying

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.680
and go try it out.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.120
By the way, in many cases,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.620
when what we do is to create a landing

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.100
page that is only aimed at generating

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.540
leads usually, in these

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.960
cases you can try with a little

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.460
on that call to action, in

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.940
your call to action main

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.060
or in the form in which

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.980
you want to capture

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.900
the data.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.020
Why is?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.460
Because it is true that if you

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.260
put more links, put videos, put

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.760
a lot of text, it is easier

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.160
to dismiss the visit.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.040
If you directly take it and only

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.400
see the button and you can generate

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.300
interest with the header or a series

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.160
of bullets, etc., if you

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.320
can do so, because the conversion

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.320
ratios will increase, because

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.340
you do not give him any clues.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.160
Another issue to consider,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.540
well, your page has to be optimized

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.420
for mobile, you have to think that

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.580
every time the traffic of people

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.520
you will have on the mobile will

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.500
be greater, so you have

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.920
to think both on desktop and

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760
on mobile.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.420
Tips to increase conversions,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.720
which are used by many companies

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.960
like Amazon or Booking,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.480
for example, because

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.620
it is urgent, there is

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.720
little time or only three

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120
rooms, book the key,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.840
etc.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.740
And if we go to the last of the moments,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.540
that is the moment in which they

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.240
will pay, well, because you

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.540
have to generate security at that

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.660
time, the payment gateway you are

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.440
using or that you incorporate

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.960
guarantees, seals, that they

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.800
remain some trust, etc.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.820
Well, as you see, we can implement

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.380
improvements in a myriad of things,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.440
what I'm going to do is, I'll leave

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.700
you the list of those we propose

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.400
to you so that you take them into

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.720
account and simply with you taking

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.740
into account these sure that the

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.060
conversion ratios are improving.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.500
But well, I'll go back to

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.100
the approach, the focus

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.940
is the following, to be very clear

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.180
what is what we want to improve,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.880
to have clear metrics of conversion

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.760
ratios, to do the website

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.920
analysis from the point

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.320
of view of metrics, how

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.900
customers use it, etc.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.360
And then take into account all this

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.200
kind of things that we are

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.060
