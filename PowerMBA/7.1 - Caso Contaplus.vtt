00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.190
As I have understood, the biggest

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.590
innovation in the business model was

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.230
that you were directed or started

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.510
to direct to a segment that until

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.310
that moment was not a buyer of

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.110
software, such as SMEs.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.910
Let’s see, I think this is a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.950
clear example of Blue Ocean.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.250
If you look at the famous Blue Oceans

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.170
book, you go to places where you’

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630
ve never been and change proposals

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.530
you’ve been taking away already

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.130
swimming things.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.570
We went to a market that

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.950
was not a customer, as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.170
were SMEs.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.570
Why is?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.410
Because they could not spend 300,000

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.990
pessets that we will transfer it

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.170
now to 10,000 euros in a license,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.910
plus all the services that there

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.290
were.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.030
They had no capacity, they had no

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.610
access to that, although they really had

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.570
the advantages they gave that world,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.650
being able to make that step.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.130
I always told you, and I make

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.090
a parenthesis here Borja, always

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.770
told the entrepreneurs, you are

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.750
spending more on air conditioning

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.390
than on software, are you

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.590
realizing what barbarity

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.130
is doing?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.670
And only those who tried it called

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.890
me and said, What was your

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.530
reason?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.270
But until I’ve seen it, the air

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.670
conditioning area is something

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.630
vital I need to work on.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.650
Then I realized what this has

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.030
brought me to enriching

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.250
my but of course, that is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.950
very complicated at first.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.410
And that’s exactly what I’m telling

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.330
you now, that’s what happened.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.610
And then we added a series of components

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.090
to the program, we gave it ease of

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.250
use, we gave it ergonomics,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.650
it was much more friendly, much more

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.810
friendly, we gave it things that we

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.190
didn’t have and we took away complexity.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.810
Then we gave it an affordable price.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.410
Then if we read the famous book,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.850
it is a clear example of Blue Ocean,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.810
that that Blue Ocean is now a red

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.670
ocean because there are competitors

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.190
everywhere that even give it

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.290
for free, that is no longer

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.970
what it was.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.790
Then effectively, answering your

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.450
question, yes, we did right,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.110
changed the product and went

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.410
to a market that at that time

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.110
was not a customer.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.990
That’s why we sold that amount

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.950
of products, more than all

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.290
the software products that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.430
were running in the mid-

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.570
sized large companies in terms

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270
of number of units.
