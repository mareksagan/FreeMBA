00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.630
You've met a lot of entrepreneurs,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.330
people who are successful, people

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.230
who have failed, which would you

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.030
say, if you had to highlight three desirable

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.810
attributes for a perfect entrepreneur

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.870
or the perfect entrepreneur,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.910
which would you say

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.610
they are?

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.710
Well look, one of the attributes

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590
that is a topic to say, but it's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.730
a reality like a temple is passion,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.430
passion, and why passion?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.910
Passion is what in the difficult moments

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.150
will make you get the best out of

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.810
you to be able to continue carrying

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.850
it out, without passion at the end

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.590
of the day you can not get up and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.070
fight against the current and give

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.610
it all 15 hours a day if you don't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.130
have it.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.450
Yes, because you often find yourself

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.670
with many unforeseen things that if...

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.570
With millions and that's where I'

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.050
m going to go to the next attribute

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.030
that you have to have that is resilience.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.210
Resilience is fundamental because

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050
it looks, being an entrepreneur

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.250
is to break 500 times, there are

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.870
good numbers or there are bad

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.610
numbers, because many times you find

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.810
yourself with millions of problems

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.650
in which the only way to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.050
solve them is to get out of you

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.670
the best you are even lower to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.850
raise you even more and do

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.030
things much bigger than you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.610
had done before and that you

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.970
do when you are from below.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.150
If you don't have that there are people

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.290
for example that I've known that that

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.230
is a supernatural gift that you have,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.370
that when you are below you come

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.190
up and do something formidable and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.530
then unfortunately I've met people that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.590
just when you are below you get depressed,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.590
leave it, abandon it and so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.010
on.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.330
Then those two attributes passion

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.430
and resilience for me are

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.150
fundamental in an entrepreneur,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.350
because if it is not better

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.490
to work for someone, try to find

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.570
a great job in which when you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.650
work for someone the good thing

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.150
it generally has is that you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.950
on Friday at 5 pm, at the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.370
time you can hang the bat

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.950
there in the office, you go home

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.330
and disconnect and you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.810
can disconnect the weekend.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.430
When you start a business, you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.190
have it in your head 24 hours

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.630
a day.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.230
In fact, the most difficult task

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.850
of the entrepreneur is how to disconnect

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.490
in free time and not be obsessed

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.890
with your own work because you have

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.050
repeat in those three attributes

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.030
you have passion, resilience

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.530
and the third and not least

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.570
important common sense.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.210
People believe that starting

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.770
a business is ultimately making

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.110
things complicated and difficult, and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.250
if you look at the probably

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.310
the most interesting in the world

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.450
are the simplest.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.190
Looking at the branch in which

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.410
I am that is the internet, example

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.710
Amazon does not cease to be a

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.830
traditional company that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.570
sold its competitors companies

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.550
sold online tradition in stores

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.950
to sell it the online that then

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.490
was increasing vertical and that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.030
then obviously then created

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.010
a monster and has created

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.790
a lot of technology because for

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.730
example being innovative in

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.650
logistics, being innovative in

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.110
processes etc etc etc but

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.770
as it started is with common

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.630
sense I want to sell online

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.950
books Uber as he started eye

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.550
I want to give better service

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.570
to cabify in this case also

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.870
how to give better

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.370
service than the taxis more

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.450
comfortable and be able to ask

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.450
directly online facebook how

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.910
can I connect with everyone

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.190
being in my home without

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.270
having to be traveling

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.870
without having that such how

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.590
can I share my experiences

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.450
instagram with photos or

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.190
it is here the most successful

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.090
generally are not the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.110
invention of a wheel

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.210
or the invention of

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.830
the lamp of a lamp

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.690
etc etc etc
