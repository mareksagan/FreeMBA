WEBVTT

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.050
Andres, thank you very much.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.810
Thanks to you.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.370
I love being here.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.770
I think your case is very

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.250
interesting and has huge potential.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.810
Let me first explain

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.230
what Colvin is.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.290
Colvin is a marketplace that connects

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.510
flowers growers with the end

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.910
customer with the aim of

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.550
disintermediating the industry.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.230
That is, when we started to

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.030
develop the business model

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.610
we met with very traditional

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.650
players who had not

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.170
managed to solve

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.190
the problems of users.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.670
The product is very expensive, it is of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490
very poor quality, that is, the flowers

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.970
last very little, the design is

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.550
usually bad and the solutions are naming.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.870
I am forced to pay a lot for something

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.590
that lasts very little to a brand

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.930
that I don't feel identified with.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.050
The problem was

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.310
mainly the supply

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.150
chain.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.670
There were a lot of people in the middle.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.190
How is the supply chain?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.110
What you have told us in a minute,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.330
we could break down into several

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.130
different topics.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.270
You've talked about supply

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.050
chain, you've talked about

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.390
value proposition and there's also

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.950
an innovation theme in the business model.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.450
Let's start with the supply

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.970
chain.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.930
How is the supply chain in your

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.430
industry?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.870
The supply chain is traditional.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.970
There are some growers, i.e. people

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.670
who grow flowers, usually concentrated

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.490
in Latin America, the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.610
Netherlands and Africa.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.290
These people pass the flowers they have

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.690
exported to another person who makes

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.850
them arrive to auction in

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.530
the Netherlands.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.590
In the Netherlands, flowers are

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.330
sold, i.e. a conventional auction

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.310
is held where customers

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890
see the flowers and buy them.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.570
In the Netherlands there are exporters

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.030
at that auction, that is, people who are

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.750
in the Netherlands and who export those

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.030
flowers to wholesalers.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.750
With which we already have another figure

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.630
that is the exporter in the Netherlands

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.970
that sells the flowers to a grower,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.710
importer, auction in the Netherlands,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.650
exporter, wholesaler, store,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.930
these are intermediaries, final

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.710
customer.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.150
Before the final customer arrived,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.990
the flowers had passed through six people.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.050
Do they apply margins?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.850
In the industry it has a particularity

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.850
that by being a precedent good, this

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.230
intermediation not only has a margin

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050
problem, which is very

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.950
serious, that is, the markup

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.610
that exists between the grower

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.290
and the final customer can be between

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.990
10 and 15 times.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.610
To explain to our students,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.810
it has multiplied.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.770
A flower worth 3 euros in

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.330
a florist is probably

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.770
worth less than 0.3 in the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.530
grower.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.350
It has that impact on costs and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.610
has another very important impact

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.750
on flower quality, because the flower

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.470
is a precedent, that is, if it passes

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.970
through six hands before it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.130
reaches you, those are days

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.910
of flower life.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.510
So what we decided was that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.170
this had no sense.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.190
There were a lot of people here

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.190
who didn't bring value to the end

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.730
user, which is what has to obsess us.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.170
Then we decided that today with

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.250
technology and logistics, the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.470
end point of the supply chain

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.790
could be linked to the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.350
end user.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.430
What happens?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.550
You are creating a marketplace that connects.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.150
What happens is that innovation is

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.890
not only that, because there is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.250
already some marketplace in

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.570
these sectors, but the great

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.690
innovation is that you are connecting

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.590
the end user, not with the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.310
previous link, which are the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.430
stores, the service providers, but

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.830
you are going directly to what

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.750
you call growers, which are the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.270
farmers who grow the flowers.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.630
And that's how we impact the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.090
business model?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.590
This allows us, in terms of business

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.090
model, to reduce the price.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.930
It is not correct, because there

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.430
is a lot of savings in the purchases,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.510
that savings can be transferred to

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.410
the end user, because we thought

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.530
it was unfair that the user had to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.870
pay 60 euros for a branch of flowers.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.390
Cost savings that are

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.690
translated into a price reduction?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.690
and correct.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.410
A thing that used to be worth 60 euros

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.150
now is worth 20 and a very significant

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.990
increase in the duration of the flowers.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.830
That is, the flowers usually lasted

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.330
three or four days when you bought

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.950
them.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.250
Colvin flowers last most likely

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.810
more than 15 days.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.450
The flowers that come before you

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.030
have passed by fewer hands.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.090
Less days ago the distance between

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.130
the point where they have been cut

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.190
and the user receives them is

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.110
very short, when usually the flowers

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.450
that the end user receives may

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.690
have spent up to 15 days making

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.550
wheel-through the world, literally.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.250
There is a very curious case that is

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.190
that farmers in Spain cut them, send

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.710
them to Holland, the flowers return

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.070
from Holland to Spain and go to the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.650
final customer.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.950
There are many movements

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.850
in the supply chain that only

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.590
have to impact the quality

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.550
of flowers, on the durability

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.370
of flowers.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.450
It has no sense.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.810
It is worth, that is, if we make

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.870
a summary of what you have

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.050
told us, innovation in the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.050
business model, a flower marketplace

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.310
that connects buyers with the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.430
first link, with producers,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.850
with growers, which allows

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030
you to save a bestial cost,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.510
which impacts on a lower

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.070
price.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.310
Therefore, the value proposal

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.530
improves a lot and improves a lot

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.450
not only because it is much cheaper,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.510
but because it is better because

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.830
the product arrives much

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.050
sooner.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.410
And how is this?

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.590
That is, if we compare this

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.570
value proposition, how is this

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.590
helping to grow?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.570
Well, at the end of this, what

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.950
we see, and I give you a very

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.010
funny data, that is that the 93%

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.350
of Colvin users, from a group

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.470
we have analyzed, says they buy

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.390
more flowers or quite a few more

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.470
flowers than they bought before.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.410
In the end, when you turn away from

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.790
the category of luxury, from

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.610
the category of buying flowers for

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.670
special occasions, because this

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.250
is a luxury product, and you put

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.870
it in a recurring consumer good,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.770
what we say is that we

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.190
do not sell flowers.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.350
That is, Colvin is not

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.210
a florist, we are opening a

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.170
new category.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.210
That is, we are offering users

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.130
the opportunity to buy flowers at

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.170
a much more competitive price,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.230
of a much higher quality and a

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.570
brand with which they feel identified,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.110
and that generates new

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.830
moments of consumption.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.870
It's super interesting, because

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.970
people did not buy flowers repeatedly

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.470
before, and what we find

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.290
is that now with our business

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.150
model people buy flowers

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.910
with a lot of recurrence.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.950
That is, something that was before for

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.510
once in life, now I take the mobile

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.010
and in two clicks I bought the flowers

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.150
and I order them because they cost

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.690
me 20 and are of a very good quality

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.790
to a brand that I feel identified

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.710
with, versus I go to the florist,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.090
pay 60 for a thing that lasts

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.970
a little and I don't like

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.450
it.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.090
In the end, we are

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.270
growing the market.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.210
When I listen to you, I realize

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.930
that there is a...

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.050
Traditionally, market sizing has

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.190
been a very important

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.150
variable with which you usually

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.550
estimate the potential of

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.090
many, how much you can get, etc.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.430
In your case, it makes no sense.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.570
You are creating that market.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.790
We are creating a market.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.050
I don't know how much...

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.790
What is the size of the shopping

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.550
market in Spain?

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.450
The volume of purchase in Spain

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.870
is one billion euros per year.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.870
For you, that metric doesn't

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.490
really matter, because you'll

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.170
be able to generate

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.850
a lot more.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.390
Yes, that's what we think,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.350
that in the end we, and again,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.910
I think we rely strictly

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.590
within the world of flowers.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.930


00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.030
We are opening up a new category,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.290
a new market, in which new moments

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.850
of use appear, people who did

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.930
not consume flowers that

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.450
go to consume.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.770
We are finally capturing market

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.490
share of other categories.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.590
I also think it is important...

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.010
So are you capturing?

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.490
Are you using zero wallet?

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.250
Yes, exactly the right.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.570
I am spending...

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.250
I have 50 euros in my pocket to

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.070
give someone something.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.010
I don't have 50 euros in my pocket

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.550
to spend a flower once in my life.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.550
I would be even more ambitious.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.850
You are probably going further.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.470
Not only are you earning zero wallet

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.130
on the gift, but you are likely to

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.970
be earning zero wallet on the gift.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:03.430
I spend the month X in empty caprices.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.190
Well now I'm going to incorporate

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.370
the flower gift as something

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.270
recurring, because the price allows

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.390
it to be an impulse purchase,

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.630
no longer perceive it as something

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.750
for a very special thing.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.350
and correct.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.150
And the price accompanied by a

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.210
brand, we made a very firm bet on the

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.410
brand from the beginning,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.050
that is, we believed that the solutions

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.930
that were on the market were

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.310
commoditized solutions,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.650
that is, there was no clear element

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.690
of differentiation between

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.170
the proposals of the difficult

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.550
competitors.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.170
actually is.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.730
It is very interesting, because

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.990
I have used some of the current platforms

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.730
and basically choose a little

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.390
by price and then, Kunaz, you

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.850
have used one because it arrives

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.830
on time and because when they send

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.770
it to another person the packaging

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.250
is attractive, but it is very

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.770
comfortably.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.930
And when that branch arrived,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.050
the person who received it probably

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.950
didn't know where it came from and

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.570
didn't care much.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.430
Why is it?

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.650
Because it was a flower branch.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.610
We sell columns.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.350
People are so funny because

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.570
they don't talk about it.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.550
I'm going to buy a flower branch,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.630
I'm going to buy a colvin.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.870
I was given a collar.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.550
So that...

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.230
The fact that you can assign

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.910
a brand or product, a name, a

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.130
brand, a surname, speaks of

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.470
all this change that you mentioned,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.490
how really the fact of opening

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.890
a new category and not getting

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.010
into frontal competition

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.510
with people that are much

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.290
bigger than you, allows you

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.030
to grow very fast by offering

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.330
solutions to users who did

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.890
not necessarily consume your

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.890
product before.
