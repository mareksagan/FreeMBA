00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.750
A waterfall please.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.910
If not in Chandler.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.850
This is strange.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.610
Prejudice, prior judgment, usually

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.630
unfavorable.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.600
Do you want?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.480
With ice and lemon, it is good.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.180
The judgment is later, usually

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.140
favorable.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.140
In aquariums we have realized that

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.420
people feel good about having

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.460
possessions.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.480
Those who doubt, they prove.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.980
I possessed.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.480
People who when they see the typical

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.680
couple of very different ages, think.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.760
It is for love.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.320
I possessed.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.200
How to think.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.780
Oh, I am not here.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.360
And finally, uy, I donâ€™t come out of here,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.460
take possession.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.900
The post-judgmental know that to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.080
know things well, you have to live them.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.160
is so.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.860
Life is full of judgments.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.800
and aquarius.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.500
The drink of those who die for

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.940
living.
