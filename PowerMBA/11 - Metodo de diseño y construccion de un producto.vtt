WEBVTT

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.300
Carlos, thank you very much for being here.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.700
thanks to.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.620
I would like you to tell us what

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.880
the design of a digital product

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.860
is, how the process is, what

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.380
the keys are, or if there is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.140
any method.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.120
We always start, like Lin,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.260
by the learning phase.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.820
For us, that is the most important,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.580
that is the one we spend the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.360
most time with.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.160
Einstein said he spent 55 minutes

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.680
thinking about the problem and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.200
5 minutes thinking about the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.680
solution.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.640
We always spend more time

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.300
on this phase of research,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.320
research, learning.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.540
This is a type of research

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.540
we call qualitative

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.340
research.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.060
There is also quantitative

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.820
research, which consists more in looking

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.140
at data, which is usually done

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.300
more during the measurement phase,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.220
but qualitative research consists

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.120
in understanding the problems

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.180
of users.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.520
How is?

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.320
Talking to Users.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.440
In product design we have a maximum

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.680
that is, you are not your user.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.280
We at OnTrack all have them

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.620
relatively easy because none

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.900
of us have a truck, none of

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.600
us ship goods.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.480
It is true that when you are a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.960
customer of something, a user of something,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.180
it is easier, it is actually easier,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.480
to give things, the hypothesis, of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.120
course, because when you are a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.360
customer, you put yourself in the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.900
situation, but in our case as a

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.880
customer, because you do not have

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.820
the tendency to do, to make that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.140
mistake.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.220
It’s easier and far more dangerous

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.240
too, because in the end your

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.980
product if it solves you just

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.720
one problem you won’t get

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.280
anywhere.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.940
You need to make sure your

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.380
product or service solves

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.200
pains that many users share.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.200
How do you do it, how do you analyze

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.520
those problems when you want

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.600
to create, when you have, when

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.520
you do a process of creating

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.820
a new product, how do you do that

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.600
research of the problems?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.540
Talking to users is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.180
the key.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.800
You have to empathize with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.900
users, put yourself in their

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.700
skin, look at problems from the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.940
user’s own point of view.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.540
Until you do this really you are

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.120
not able to understand exactly

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.560
where the problem is.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.740
One common mistake

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.180
is to confuse problems

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.140
with solutions.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.840
We look for problems to solve,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.180
but the most natural way

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.900
to communicate a problem is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.480
through a solution.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.580
So much of our work consists

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.900
in separating solutions

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.100
from problems and getting

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.220
to detect the problem behind

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.800
something that is given to us.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.620
Can you give them some specific

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.280
example of identification on

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.760
OnTrack or in any of the other

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.500
companies you have participated in?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.220
How did you take this first step

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.140
in identifying a problem?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.040
Curiously, we at OnTrack, unlike

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.860
many companies and many startups,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.720
do not work with a roadmap

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900
of functionality.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.040
We do not have any plans

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.020
on what features we will incorporate

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.160
into our products in the coming

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.700
months.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.100
We are working on a roadmap of

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.980
problems and this is key.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.080
We often apply our product

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.180
design process to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.900
each of these problems.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.280
The result of that process is often

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.140
a new functionality, other times

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.720
it is to introduce a new process,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.740
other times it is to decide that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.120
this problem is not worth solving

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.660
it or we have come to the point

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.140
of identifying a problem that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.520
was generating that first problem

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.480
that has called our attention.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.200
And here we get a lot of solutions

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.640
and we have to do that job

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.300
of peeling the solution

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.720
until we find the root

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.500
problem.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.740
What you said about the roadmap

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.480
of problems rather than solutions

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.100
or functionality, etc., really

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.360
seems brilliant to me because if

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.420
anyone who has been involved

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.140
in a company of a certain

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.020
phase of product development,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.520
etc., everyone knows that what

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.360
we have in mind or always is

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.460
projected is to incorporate

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.620
over time a number of

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.960
additional functionalities.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.220
And this is excessively central

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.740
product, when what you do is really

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.680
much brighter and it is to forget

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.140
our functionalities and that everything

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.100
is born of the customer, much

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.440
more client-centric, that is

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.520
born of the problems that

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.560
the customer has, that I imagine

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.520
that the problems will change

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.760
or you will identify

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
them with time.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.280
We have very changing

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.960
roadmaps.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.500
This we in UX and design call

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.700
Featuritis.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.480
When you think that adding features

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.360
to your product will make your

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.560
product better and more

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.820
interesting for users.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.460
When what we know, so what

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.900
we know of user experience

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.460
design, reality tends to be

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.680
as simple as it is a product.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.560
The more things you get to remove

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.260
from your product that do not help

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.280
solve the main problem that the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.580
user has, the better, because

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.920
the easier to use will be that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.680
product.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.620
Less cognitive load will generate

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.660
on the user who interacts with that

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.160
product.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.940
and perfect.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.100
We will move forward in the process.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.300
The second phase we do in

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.160
our design process is a phase

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.780
of divergence.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.380
Never fall in love with your first idea.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.920
Always think about alternative

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.060
solutions.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.940
This is more difficult than it seems.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.760
Your brain, at the moment a solution

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.400
arrives, asks you to download

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.120
resources and move on to something else,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.560
stop thinking so intensely

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.640
about something.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.960
So, you need to have mechanisms

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.620
to force yourself to think

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.220
about a problem for enough time,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.120
to think about many possible

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.180
solutions.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.620
There are many exercises

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.820
that help us in this

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.400
process.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.660
OnTrack uses one called

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.980
Crazy Eats.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.880
It is an exercise that we do

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.720
by inviting people from many

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.580
different profiles.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.900
In fact, the best solutions often

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.280
do not come from designers,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.160
they come from business people,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.660
from tech people, from people

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.220
of operations.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.040
So we take that advantage, use

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.240
them, call for sessions of about

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.600
half an hour with five or six

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.020
different profiles and ask them

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.000
to pick up a folio and double

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.840
it into eight parts.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.380
When you reopen it, at the end of the day,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.120
what you have left is a kind of sheet

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.580
with eight different vignettes.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.420
We give you a quick, very

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.340
schematic idea or write

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.820
a possible solution to a problem.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.680
There are many ways to do this, by

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.560
tossing a lot, putting restrictions

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.660
or the sky is the limit.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.020
Often, depending on how much

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.680
time you have and where you

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.020
want to go, not putting any kind

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.540
of restriction can help ideas

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.940
that initially seem very crazy

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.120
plant, communicate

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.820
and that often leads to

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.900
really interesting ideas.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.960
Then we give 30 seconds in which people

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.000
are forced to sketch very quickly

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.420
and when that process is

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.360
over each one tells the rest

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.800
of the group their possible

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.860
solutions.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.260
This is not design by committee,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.620
we do not design by committee,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.140
we know that it does not

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.600
work, but it allows us to

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.220
channel very different ideas that

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.500
would not have happened

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500
to us as designers from our prisma

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.200
and that leads us to the next

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.340
phase of the process that

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.040
is the conversion

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.100
phase, of writing.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.200
At this point you have this sheet for

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.820
all the number of people who have participated,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.760
that is, you have a multitude of possible

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.280
solutions to the problems you have

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.880
identified and we really

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.440
do not choose a solution

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.300
in a democratic way, we do

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.700
not vote for the one we like the

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.140
most.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.940
There is a person who is responsible

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.680
for deciding what solution

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.620
has been put.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.040
The solution is a combination of several

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.480
ideas that have arisen here, but

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.800
it is not a democratic process.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.060
We have listened to everyone, we have

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.880
done a good research, we have

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.260
all the information and with that

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.280
context there is someone who decides.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.940
We will bet on this solution.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.880
One is chosen.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.540
One is chosen.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.380
We are in the final phase, right?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.360
The last stage is the prototyping

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.340
phase.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.860
Architect Frank Lloyd Wright used

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.620
to say, I prefer to use a

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.420
rubber slurry on the drawing

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.480
table than a tire hammer

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.320
on the work.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.340
It makes a lot of sense.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.440
If you can very quickly prototype

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.920
something that looks very much

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.440
like your final solution, whether

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.580
it’s a new product, a new functionality,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.180
a new screen and text it with

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.020
users, you’ll learn things

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.260
very quickly that will allow

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.860
you to see if your solution

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.380
is really good or not.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.720
And that brings us to the final

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.640
phase that is the texting phase with

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.820
users of that prototype.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.360
Usually five users are enough.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.320
With five users you start observing

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.060
patterns.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.400
And you can determine in almost every

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.740
case whether your solution

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.300
is good enough or not.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.380
This exercise you are

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.400
saying to test is a qualitative

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.920
learning, because now

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.140
we will have more details.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.060
This exercise you are saying

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.140
to test with five users, in

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.360
this case the MVP or the prototype,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.220
as we want to call it, could

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.520
have saved millions and millions

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.900
and millions to a lot of companies

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.880
that have jumped it or done

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.560
it badly or did it too late,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.820
because they did what you

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.040
are saying with five users,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.320
but they did it after

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.680
spending it...

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.960
The most common mistake is to do it when

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.400
you have already built your solution.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.560
That is.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.000
And you draw exactly the same

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.040
conclusions from a prototype that

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.840
you have also cost a midday to implement.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.420
One important thing when you’re doing

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.360
exercise with users is not looking

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.780
for opinions, looking for reactions.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.740
You don’t go to a user with

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.520
a prototype asking if you like this

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.000
or it looks nice or you would pay

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.460
for it.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.500
What you want is to observe

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.000
the user interacting with

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
your solution, make sure first

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.060
that you are solving a problem

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.720
and secondly that the

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.360
solution is good enough.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.560
This is a summary of the entire

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.080
process.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.360
Come to.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:03.420
You have told us that it is something

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.520
that many companies, especially those

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.640
that have a certain attraction,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.560
because when we are talking about who

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.860
makes an idea, it is easier to start

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.040
from that problem, but when you

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.640
are talking, for example, of

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.120
OnTrack, in which you are already a

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.860
product that works, a model of marketability,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.660
etc., it is very easy to fall

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.080
into the roadmap of the functionalities

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.260
and you do what you are always

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.080
incorporating the perspective

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.780
of the customer and you are

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.780
starting out of the problem.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.500
From there, the next process,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.220
always the next step in the

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.560
process, is the divergence.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.940
Hear, force yourself to think about

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.180
many possible solutions to this

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.920
problem before falling in love with any.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.100
In fact, you should never fall

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.540
in love with any solution, right?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.320
But before you bet on one, force

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.540
yourself to think about many solutions

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.620
and for this we use exercises

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.980
like the one I have commented

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.080
on that force you to go through

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.060
that process.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.640
I have experienced something

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.340
else, and many more people have

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.540
experienced it, is that in

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.760
this second phase of choosing

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.380
the solution, it is often

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.380
chosen by the person who is

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.620
above the error range.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.320
It is an error.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.820
You have to win the best idea, either

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.400
from the CEO or from the last fellow

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.760
who has entered the company

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.280
and invited your divergence

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.160
process.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.020
So, we have already made the

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.560
divergence and we have a lot of possible

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.020
solutions and one is chosen.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.860
You have to bet on one.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.480
What happens is that the next

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.380
step is to test it as soon

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.040
as possible.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.220
and correct.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.640
Build a prototype that allows you

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.200
to obtain the maximum information

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.420
about your solution in the

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.260
shortest possible time and know if

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.120
you are on the right track or not.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.980
If the results of that user

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.220
test are good, go ahead.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.620
The link building phase.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.140
If the result is not entirely

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.860
good, take a step back, return

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.440
to the prototyping phase, apply

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.000
what you just learned and test

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.040
with users again.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.980
If the result is a disaster, you

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.600
have not understood the problem

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.940
correctly or it doesn’t exist.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.380
Return to the first box.
