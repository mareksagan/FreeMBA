00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.780
In the balance sheet, assets

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.720
are classified into current

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.180
and non-current

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.780
assets and liabilities

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.860
as well.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.700
In this class I want you to understand

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.260
very well, it will help you a lot to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.600
understand the balance of situation better.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.960
I want you to know what are the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.920
criteria for classifying into

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.020
current and non-current and what

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.440
are the types of assets and liabilities

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.100
that a company actually has.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.440
Well, the theoretical classification

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.060
of the asset is based on its liquidity,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.200
that is, we have assets, current

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.140
assets are liquid assets that

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.580
will be transformed into treasury

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.920
in a period of less than one

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.780
year and non-current assets

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.700
in a period of more than one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.200
year.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.440
Current assets are the assets

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.740
that were formerly called circulating,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.000
they are the liquid assets

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.520
that are related to the operations

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.880
of the company and are basically

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360
three, it is cash, treasury,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.080
it is the accounts of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.640
customers to collect and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.320
it is the stocks, that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.720
is, it is the goods, raw materials,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.960
etc., that we still have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.400
in the balance sheet before

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.340
selling them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580
A common asset, for example,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.060
is the stock in a supermarket.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.200


00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.570
Current assets are active assets

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.170
that are constantly rotating, in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.410
rotation.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.610
We collect, we sell, we generate

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.910
customer salaries, we collect,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.730
we invest raw materials,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.170
etc., it is a continuous cycle.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.350
And companies have another type of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.470
assets that are non-current assets,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.310
which are assets that remain

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.850
in the company, are assets

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.470
that remain in the company

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.690
for a long time, are stable, because

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.590
they are the formerly

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.910
called fixed assets or immobilized,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.030
because we think of equipment,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.550
long-term financial

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.570
investments, in machinery,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.990
in buildings, on

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630
the web page.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.910
For example, this is a non-current

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.350
asset, because if we have a business

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010
related to the work and we have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.610
vehicles of this type, they would

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.310
be non-current assets.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570
We go with the side of the sources or

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.690
the origins of financing, in this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.850
case with the recorded asset and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.950
with the liability.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.410
The first thing we will do

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.850
is to classify the passive.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.970
We have classified the asset

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.410
according to its liquidity,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.910
in the time it becomes treasury.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.030
The asset, the passive, the passive,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.950
we will classify according

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.630
to their requirements.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.850
What does this mean for the demandability?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.150
This is the time limit for repaying

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.530
these debts.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.210
We have current liabilities with

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.530
a term of less than one year, that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.030
is, in less than one year we have

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.810
to return current liabilities.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.290
Non-current liabilities, which

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.210
are long-term debts, must

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.550
be repayed within a period

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.470
of one year.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.990
Well, what we will do is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.210
join net assets with non-

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.750
current liabilities, with

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.670
long-term debts.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.150
Why is it?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.490
Because they are resources that

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.110
are really permanently in the company.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.970
On the one hand, net assets, social

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.190
capital, do not have to be returned.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.310
And on the other hand, I want you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.750
to keep in mind that long-term debt

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.750
is usually a fixed balance within

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.670
the company.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.070
We are usually refinancing

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.310
and we are usually refinancing.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.910


00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.390
It is a balance that remains.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.850
When the deadline arrives, it is usually

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.130
renegotiated.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.850
And we have at the bottom the current

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.010
liabilities, which are short-

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.970
term debts, which we will repay

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.350
in a period of less than

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.050
12 months.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.750
Finally, we go back to the balance sheet

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.650
and see that we have two big blocks.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.550
On the one hand, we have non-

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.950
current assets, fixed assets,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.030
such as machinery, website,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.570
intangible assets, etc.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.750
The buildings and to their right

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.530
the permanent resources, which

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.670
are long-term debts and

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.010
net assets.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.350
And at the bottom we have the current

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.870
assets, the circulating assets,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.470
the assets closest to the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.850
operations of the rotating

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.030
companies.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.010
Current liabilities are the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.290
debts that we have to repay

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.570
in the short term.
