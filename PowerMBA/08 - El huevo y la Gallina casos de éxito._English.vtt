00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.200
As we explained in the program,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.080
at the time you have added a

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.220
large part of the supply and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.040
demand in a specific sector

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.980
at the local level, in this

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.320
case local is national, the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.600
entry barrier is huge.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.260
Because a competitor that starts from

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660
zero has very difficult to capture

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.340
so many users, if we put ourselves

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.360
in the case of the Red Level it would

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.980
be very difficult to capture users,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.240
because I would like you to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.920
tell us how you started, because

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080
at first it seems very difficult

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.220
to capture users when you don’t

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.300
have restaurants and it seems

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.120
very difficult to go to restaurants

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.380
with a proposal when you

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.660
still don’t have users.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.360
I don’t know how you solved this that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.940
is sometimes called the challenge of

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.720
the egg and the chicken.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.240
and correct.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.600
Indeed, that’s a classic

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.240
discussion that calls, in our

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.220
case, what we did was something

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.560
we did intuitively and then

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.460
the truth that from Samaipata

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.020
we have written quite a bit

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.380
about it, which is what we call

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.840
a node saturation expansion,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.220
which comes to be identifying

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.760
which relevant nodes will

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.840
generate those network effects

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.660
and focus on gaining density

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.640
in specific segments

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100
of your supply and your demand.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.780
Many times it is geographical,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.380
in our case it was, for example,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.540
the student neighborhood in Madrid,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.980
where the Moncloa was, that area

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.920
that was the best postal code in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600
Spain and probably one of the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.220
best in Europe.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.260
We’re referring to gaining critical

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.500
mass in very small niches,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.560
because it’s easier than

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.240
nationally.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.100
Of course, nationally it is very

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340
complicated, but you can gain critical

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.600
mass in the Moncloa neighborhood

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.160
because you add x restaurants,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.920
5 or 6 restaurants and the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.200
students who live around.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.420
and correct.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.000
In this way, what you can is those

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.300
network economies, that each restaurant

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.900
that joins adds more value to

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.460
users, more users add value to restaurants

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.540
in a very concentrated way, and in

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.680
addition, it could come to generate

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620
some virality through mouth to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.240
mouth, that is, a user uses

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420
it along with a friend who is that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.440
day in his home, he tells the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.620
other, then he goes to the other

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140
house, ask from the other house,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.760
they also generate some

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.180
virality.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.700
That makes it much more efficient

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.300
from the point of view of how to lift

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.340
the flight in that marketplace,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.200
than if you try to do the same

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.980
exercise at the national level

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.120
of the blow would be much more complicated.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.100
So we did that very early,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.020
we launched it at Primo Madrid,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.540
then Barcelona, and then it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.440
went up and up.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.960
This is from the point of view of more...
