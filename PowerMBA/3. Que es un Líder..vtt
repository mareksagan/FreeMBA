00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.870
There is a lot of written about

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.130
what a leader is, especially about

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.290
the characteristics that a leader

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.630
must have and it is said that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.090
if he has to have empathy, communication

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.330
ability, well many other

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.410
things.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.390
We will now define

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.850
what we think is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.870
a leader.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.570
With what purpose?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.730
We must understand what

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.330
is a leader and what

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.450
is not a leader.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.650
And as we define what a leader

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.250
is, we will identify

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.230
what are the main characteristics,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.190
competencies or

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.530
knowledge a person

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.730
must have to become

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.590
a leader.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.730
And we'll also incorporate a concept

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.090
that's important to understand

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.250
and is the difference between being

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.810
a leader or being a manager.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.190
A leader has to have certain

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.030
characteristics of a manager, but

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.210
a manager does not have to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.950
be a leader.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.050
Being a leader is something more ambitious

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.110
and there are millions of managers

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.210
in the world and then what we're

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.490
going to do is the following,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.250
let's define what a leader

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.990
is from what a leader has

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.030
to do or has to be able to do.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.770
A leader must have a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.090
vision, a leader must have

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.550
the ability to motivate

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.170
and inspire others to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.610
commit to that vision,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.790
a leader must be able

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.990
to manage that project

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.290
to that vision and finally

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.310
a leader must be able

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.570
to manage teams and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.790
people, get the most

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.210
out of those people.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.090


00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.410
So here we already make the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.770
distinction between leader and manager,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.690
a manager is a person who is good

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.490
at points three and four, knows

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.590
how to manage projects and knows

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.970
how to manage people, after

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.390
all what he knows is how to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.370
manage resources to goals,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.750
that is a manager.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.330
And a leader has to start from there and,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.370
of course, sometimes when it comes

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.870
to leadership in many cases it is only

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.990
about the fourth point, it is about

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.130
the topic of the relationship

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.330
between people, that you are

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.390
credible, reliable, empathic, etc.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.230
Let's go one by one, the first

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.070
thing we said to be a leader

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.550
you have to have a vision.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.230
All from the vision, it's hard

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.070
to define Elon Musk's vision in 2003

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.550
or 2002 or something like that the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.070
growth of the electric car would

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.970
be unstoppable, at that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.930
time it seemed like it was madness

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.730
and in fact a lot of people

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.010
turned their backs on it.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.850
Mark Zuckerberg had a vision

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.350
that social media would

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.910
change the way we

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910
relate to people.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.590
We at The Power NBA, I don't want

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.830
to compare it with the previous

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.110
examples because obviously

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.630
we are light years but we also

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.790
had a vision and it is that

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.070
we could revolutionize the way

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.490
we learn about business,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.710
management, marketing, etc.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.230
We have said that a leader has

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.850
to have a vision and now what

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.210
we have to analyze is what a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.030
person has to have to be able

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.090
to have a vision or to be a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.810
visionary.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.450
And here comes the dilemma, something

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.910
that is always said to me that

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.190
I was asked before in the office, is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.490
the leader born or the leader becomes?

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.070
We don't have a response to this,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.150
that is, this is not white

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.610
or black, but it's true that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.210
to have a vision there are certain

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.550
personal traits that help.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.350
Basically there are some personality

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.030
types for which it's easier to

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.970
be a visionary and we've studied

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.110
it at The Power NBA.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.550
One of the perspectives from which

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.030
a personality is analyzed is that

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.770
you are intuitive or sensory

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.290
or sensitive.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.050
Intuitive people are people

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.490
who naturally work their head

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.730
by looking at the photo from

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.690
above, have more strategic

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.550
vision, analyze patterns,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.490
identify opportunities,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.810
go to the bottom of things,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.450
etc.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.270
These are the intuitive people and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.530
the more sensitive or sensory

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.250
people are more tied to the senses,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.590
they are more tied to the day-

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.110
to-day.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.510
For some things, for some professions,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.970
for some functions it is

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.850
better to be sensitive, sensory

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.450
and for some things it is better

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.310
to be intuitive.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.790
And to be a leader and to be a visionary

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.710
it's best to be intuitive and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.590
it's proven.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.810
And the great leaders, all in

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.850
the personality are INTJs, good

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.970
models, types of personality

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.990
in which they have very developed

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.130
intuition.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.030
So, to the question of whether it

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.990
is born or made, for now the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.550
answer is that we are somewhat conditioned.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.350
There is one part that is innate.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.930
However, and I also want to make

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.970
it clear because it's something

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.230
we've said many times, knowledge

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.210
helps.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.590
That is, when you are able to do a

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.330
very good analysis of your environment,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.530
when you understand the situation very

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.530
well, when you have incorporated

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.790
into your knowledge the models that

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.230
help to innovate, etc., such

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.510
as the Blue Ocean strategy, for

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.310
example, or tools that we

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.370
have seen, many such as the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.530
Business Model Canvas, for example,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.550
when you have analyzed cases

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.770
of success, failure, when

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.210
you have enriched your mind in

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.870
this way, it is easier that you

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.650
are a visionary, it is easier

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.490
that you identify an opportunity

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.970
that ends up becoming

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.090
a vision.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.530
Now, we go to the second of the points.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.250
A leader must be able,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.490
in addition to having a vision,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.010
to be able to inspire

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.990
other people to make

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.030
promises with that vision.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.070


00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.850
So that others can buy that

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.930
view.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.250
And here we'll analyze, well,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.590
and what's needed to be able

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.250
to do that?

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.330
And I would summarize it in one word,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.390
you have to be a good seller.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.680
What does a good seller have?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.380
Well, but a good real seller, because

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.820
he is a person who is credible, in

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.500
whom others trust, because

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.220
he has shown that he is reliable,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.340
that he has knowledge, that he is

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.560
a reference for others in something,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.360
in that in particular.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.460
A good salesman has enough

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.920
empathy to identify what other

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.300
people want, what their goals

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.500
are, and align those goals

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.640
with that vision, and so on.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.560
Therefore, a leader, in addition

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.720
to having a vision, has to be a

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.080
good seller to convince other

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.560
people and that they

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.920
commit to that vision he has

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.360
had.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.260
And I'm going to give you a

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.160
terrifying example, but it's an

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.440
example that can help us illustrate

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.380
this ability of a person who got

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.240
millions to share their

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.040
vision, and it's Hitler.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.760
Hitler had a vision of how he

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.820
wanted the world to look,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.020
horrible, but still he managed

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.280
to get millions of people

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.500
committed to that vision.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.900
We have already seen that the leader

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.960
has to have a vision, he has

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.480
to be able to get other people

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.460
to commit to it, to align the

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.760
efforts of other people with

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.840
the vision, and now we enter the

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.120
roles or characteristics

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.620
of manager, of manager.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.660
A leader, in addition, has to be able to

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.380
manage the resources with which it counts,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.040
which are some deadlines, which are some

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.980
of the most important.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.560
Sometimes the scarce resources

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.920
are usually money, resources

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.280
are the people you count on,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.700
the context in which they are,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.680
the barriers you will encounter,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.560
are the ingredients you

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.160
count on to your vision.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.940


00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.800
A leader, in addition, has to be

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.080
good at this, has to be a good

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.720
manager.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.660
This is what is learned.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.760
In project management there

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.540
are methodologies that

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.480
help us manage resources

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.880
to the goals.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.620
You will learn to define the KPIs,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.060
which are the metrics we will use

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.040
to see if we are on the right track

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.100
or not, to identify the tactics

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.300
or the more tactical goals,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.860
to define deadlines, resources,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.640
etc.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.840
How to organize resources?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.860
Well, all that is project management

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.820
and, as I say, it's learning.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.540
There are methodologies, it is a matter of studying them.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.920
We will share some.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.280
And finally, the fourth of a

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.440
leader's characteristics or functions

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.580
is that he has to be able to

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.440
get the most out of the people

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.300
or those teams he has, which

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.720
is basically his most valuable

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.980
resource.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.700
And, as I said, sometimes, when we

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.660
talk about leadership, we only talk

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.420
about this fourth point, what happens

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.360
is that we have made a more

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.560
ambitious definition of leadership.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.540
In what consists this?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.140
Well, you have to be able to identify

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.280
if your people have the knowledge

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.440
or skills enough for if

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.660
you will not have to train them,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.140
you will have to empathize

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.460
with them, you will have to be

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.660
transparent, you will have to

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.360
give them all the support of the

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.100
world, that this is what we refer

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.420
to with service leadership,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.000
that we will talk about it.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.460
You can learn here too.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.400
Here there are also many

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.460
skills that are learned, which

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.020
is basically management of teams.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.280
There are methodologies that

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.100
will help us manage people

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.600
to get the most out of them,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.920
so that teamwork is more

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.880
efficient.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.660
So, as we have seen, what is

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.100
a leader and what is not a leader?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.240
A leader is a person who is

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.120
able to have a vision, for which

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.960
there are certain innate skills

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.320
or traits that will help you,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.280
but experience and knowledge

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.080
also counts.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.100
It's easier to be a visionary,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.560
identify opportunities when

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.060
you've acquired enough knowledge.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.520
You have to be a good salesman

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.640
because you have to get other

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.020
people to commit to your vision

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.600
and you have to be a good

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.280
manager.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.440
What is this concrete in?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.500
Well, then in that you have to

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.920
be able to get the most of the

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.820
resources you have.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.100
You have to know how to plan,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.520
manage the project and finally you

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.280
have to be able to get the most out

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.780
of the people that are your most

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.800
valuable resource.
