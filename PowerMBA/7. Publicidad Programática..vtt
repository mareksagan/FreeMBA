00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.020
Javi, I would like you to analyze

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.600
a concept that is programmatic

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.580
advertising that you named in

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.820
previous classes, which is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.040
a growing trend that I think

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.100
we should all understand.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.800
First, what is it or what consists

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.280
of?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.200
Well, I think programmatic advertising

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.500
has been the biggest revolution

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.560
we've ever had in digital

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
advertising, let's.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.360
That is, it has been what has changed

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.540
is the new driver of digital

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.100
advertising.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.980
To explain it, you remember in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.660
an earlier class that we talked

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240
about the ways we could hire advertising.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.760


00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.540
It could be a manual way, practically

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.700
where the advertiser arrived

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.120
either directly or through an

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.860
agency, spoke with the support,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.260
negotiated a space at

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.560
a certain price and impacted

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.020
the user.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.260
Let's say that programmatic

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.980
advertising can automatize all

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.320
that data-based process,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.400
something we didn't have in the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.480
manual process and through

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.460
technology before.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620
That would be the most pure

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.360
definition of programmatic

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.200
advertising.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.240
That we have then that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.440
in the old manual hiring

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.580
mode, basically what we could

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.200
have was to decide on what

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.820
support we were making the hiring.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.320
I want to impact a media

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.360
or I want to impact

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.920
a social network or

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.200
I want to impact a media.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.600
But in the end you had to do what

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
we called a cherry picking, almost

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460
picking up a little bit each of those

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.560
supports where you wanted to impact.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.060
And I did it based on the support and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.740
on the audience I thought that support

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.360
had or that support deserved

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.860
that I had or comscore,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.180
that meter, deserved that I had.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.940
Basically, I want to impact

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.640
men over 40.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.580
I will also be able to get out of the digital

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.100
brand, as I will be able to reach that audience.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.700
actually is.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.160
What is happening?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.540
That my digital brand can tell me,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.580
hear, because in the age range

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.280
between 30 and 40 years, because

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.900
I have a million users.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.900
Of course, if I put or impact with

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.240
a banner in brand, I don't know

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420
if I'm impacting any of them,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.540
a few thousand, that whole million.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.080
So if I'm looking for

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.180
a very specific segment,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880
what I'm being is inefficient,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.860
because I'm impacting

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.700
many.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.100
You are impacting many of those,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.260
but also many more.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.020
And that is generating a cost to me.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.620
So the cost is inefficient

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.900
too, because I'm not impacting

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.980
and I just want to really

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.180
impact the audience I'm interested

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.760
in.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
This is something that programmatic

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.660
advertising solves.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.980
Why is?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460
We put that date.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.000
That layer of date is what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820
we call the attributes that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.560
each of us has in their navigation.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.260


00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.940
So, when you want to impact

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.960
a user with certain attributes,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.220
through programmatic advertising,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.480
you can do it all and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.120
every time exclusively

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.860
to those users who have

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.680
those attributes.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.320
This makes the process infinitely

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.580
more efficient.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.040
You can do it no matter

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.320
where you are navigating.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.740
I don't have to go looking for support,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740
but the whole process, all the technology

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.000
I have behind, will tell

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.760
me at every moment where

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820
those users are and I will be

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.200
able to pick up those users.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.580
Then we entered Vale.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.600
Let us put ourselves in the situation.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.840
We want to impact men aged 35.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.980
What were we doing before?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.980
We go to the brand and other media,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.800
one by one, etc., with the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.080
inefficiency that is in terms of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.100
time and effort.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.380
And it's also that once we

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.860
had a banner on that medium and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.680
we put it on the brand, in addition

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.980
to the men of 35, we were impacting

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680
people with other profiles,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.120
ages, etc., and we are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.160
paying for them all.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.500
That's what we do, we want to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440
impact the 35-year-old men,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.520
just them.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.500
Technology or programming in this

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.600
case allows us to only

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.280
impact them, but also through

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.120
very different supports.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.660
We have reversed the process.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.480
It's not so much that we define

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.160
the support and shoot with everything

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.600
that falls, but that we're

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.280
going to shoot only our target

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.640
audience through a multitude of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.000
supports.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.460
That is.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.660
This does not mean that support

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.620
is not important.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.000
Why is?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.140
There is a context that is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.240
always important.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.660
It is not the same to be browsing

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.240
in a notorious, credible, credible

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.500
media, that to be browsing

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.040
at least on sites that can

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.680
be, I imagine, illegal downloads

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.940
or series and so

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.880
on, where we can

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.780
get involved.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.260
That user may be there too,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.300
but I probably don't care

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.020
to impact them.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.140
You also choose support.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.100
We can choose which to exclude or which

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.060
to integrate.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.880
You can make a whitelist or a whitelist.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.720
The important thing about all this

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.680
is that we can find the user

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.300
on virtually any site during

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.160
their browsing, with the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.600
attributes we want to give him.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.160
And I tell you, at anecdotal level,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.020
of Power MBA, we used programmatic

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.560
advertising, among other strategies,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.820
and well, basically, I, without

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.080
having participated in that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.360
answer, what I perceived is that,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.580
immediately, we were coming

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.240
out in very many media, because

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.120
I appeared myself, my

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.100
face even, when I was in

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.140
expansion or when I

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.380
was in the world, etc., and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.000
had been hired that same

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.860
afternoon.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.440
actually is.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.340
That is the efficiency that offers you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.640
and the immediate that offers

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
you too, and apart from

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.200
automation, which is one of the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.440
keys to programmatic advertising.
