WEBVTT

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.920
We will go with the answers to the

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.400
accounting and finance test.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.580
There are 26 questions and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.660
each one has only one correct

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.200
answer.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.600
Which of the following items

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.660
is not included in the permanent

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.640
resources?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.560
Permanent resources are the current

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.280
assets plus the non-current liabilities.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.160


00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.340
Current liabilities are those

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.120
that have a debt that has a

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.100
venture of less than one

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.540
year.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540
This is outside of the permanent resources.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.840
What is Spontaneous Financing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.400
for Suppliers?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.420
What are the advantages of

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.840
financing through suppliers?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.560
You don't have to pay a rate

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.420
of interest, it effectively reduces

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.560
the operating fund needs.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.060
The more you finance with

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.340
suppliers, the lower the NOFs and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.560
do not contribute to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.040
the debt rate, so they are all

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.440
correct.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.560
Permanent assets should be

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.480
equal to, or greater or smaller

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.760
than non-current assets

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
or fixed assets.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.120
Permanent resources, which are

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.700
net assets and non-current liabilities,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.320
which are debts with a maturity

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260
of more than one year, should

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.580
in principle be equal to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.700
or greater than non-current

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.720
assets or fixed

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.560
assets.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.540
We will see it from another perspective.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.880
That is, non-current

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.200
assets or fixed assets in principle

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.780
should be financed how?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.500
And here it is well understood.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.620
Keep in mind that non-current

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.040
assets or fixed assets are low-

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.160
liquid assets that will be converted

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.640
into treasury over a period

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.860
of more than one year.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.500
So how should you finance it?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.820
With short-term debt or with permanent

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.780
resources?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.540
You have to fund it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.320
with permanent funds.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.440
If we increase the average period

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.880
of payment to suppliers and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.340
you will finance it,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.780
the debt to leverage ratio is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.300
what happens with it.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.200
What happens to him is that he is decreasing.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.020
We think we have an asset

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.280
of one million euros.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.780
This increases the average

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.400
payment period to suppliers.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780
In this case, the operational

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.160
needs of funds that they make

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.100
increase or decrease.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.320
We have to fund one million euros.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.140
We can finance them in different ways,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.360
it is the current asset, the most

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.900
liquid asset.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.180
Well, because the later

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.880
we pay suppliers, the smaller

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.440
the operational fund

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.340
needs will be.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680
That is, they decrease.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.690
If we increase the rotation

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.350
of stocks, the operational

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.570
needs of funds they make increase

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.450
or decrease.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.490
The stock is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.570
in the balance sheet.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.350
If what we do is increase the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.090
rotation, that part decreases.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.410
The operational needs of

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.130
funds are lower.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.450
We have to fund a smaller asset.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.610
Now we'll think that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.470
we've increased the rotation

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.450
of assets, for example

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850
stocks, as we've seen before.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.250
What happens to the asset'

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.310
s profitability?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.990
Well, the profitability of the asset

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.010
in this case what it does is increase.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.310
Let us explain why.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.930
The profitability of the asset is

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.370
equal to the net profit for the asset.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.230
Therefore, if we increase the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.990
turnover of assets,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.010
we need less asset to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.770
get the same net profit.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.150
Or, seen from another perspective,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.970
we could have more net profit with

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.030
the same asset.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.290
Therefore, in any of the cases

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.970
what we do is to increase

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.310
the profitability of the asset.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.250
Therefore, it is always necessary to seek to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.570
ensure that the rotation of assets is as large

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.290
as possible.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.930
Now, let's go to the profitability

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.110
of own funds or ROE.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.790
What depends on?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.170
It depends on the profitability on

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.930
the asset, correct, obvious.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.110
It also depends on the leverage ratio.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.430
The more profitability you get

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.390
on your asset and the more you

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.430
leverage and the less your own funds

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.130
are, the greater the profitability

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.750
you get on each euro invested

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.970
in your own fund.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.890
Both answers are correct.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.250


00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.360
If we increase the leverage

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.340
ratio, the balance of equity

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.360
funds over equity, what

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.380
happens?

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.360
Increases or decreases.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.360
What it does is decrease.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.280
We are more likely to be funded

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.360
by foreign funds or debt.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.900
So if we increase the leverage

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.200
ratio, the profitability

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.340
on equity or the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.720
ROE, what happens?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120
Here, it is necessary to matte as long

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.180
as the profitability on the asset

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.900
is higher than the cost of the debt.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.400
What do you do when you

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.220
are in debt is increasing.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.100
If those investments you are making

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.720
generate a higher profitability

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000
than the cost of debt, what you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.080
do is that the profitability

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.060
you get from the money that the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.140
partners have put in is

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.740
higher.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.780
Therefore, we must seek a

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.280
greater leverage, as we

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.400
have seen many times, always,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.640
but well, to get to a point

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.560
that is reasonable.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.740
The economic profitability is ROE,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.040
the profitability on the asset

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
and the financial is the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.820
profitability on the own funds.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.440
In principle, which company will have

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.300
a profitability on the largest asset?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.860
The test has a profit

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.380
of 0.5 million

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.260
euros.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.620
A gym that has a considerable

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.960
asset, a cellar that

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.700
also has it.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.220
In the case of gyms they are capex, they

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.200
are non-current active.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.420
In the case of the cellar, most

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.500
of what you will have is current

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.480
assets, which are stocks,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.800
etc., or a consultant

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.480
that almost has no assets.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.080
If the test has the same

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.980
net profit, the consultant

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.140
will have a much higher profit

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.240
on the asset.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.790
A business with a higher risk

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.470
we have to apply a discount rate

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.670
when we want to value that

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.610
business.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.310
What do we apply?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.790
A higher discount rate or a

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.730
lower discount rate.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.290
Because the risk is higher,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.690
we have to discount it, we have

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.910
to demand a higher discount rate.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.660
This is a bit the same.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.960
If we increase the required

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.880
discount rate, and what we

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.380
do is discount cash flows, the

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.680
current value of the cash

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.100
flows you make increases or decreases.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.380


00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.740
If we increase the discount

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.200
rate required, the current value

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.560
is decreasing.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.150
The value of a company is equal to

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.850
the value of its own funds plus or

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.730
less the value of the debt.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.010
The answer is more.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.450
Sometimes it is a little

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.570
counterintuitive, but if we

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.070
think from another perspective,

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.730
the value of equity is equal to

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.310
the value of the company minus

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.130
the value of debt.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.810
So sure you understand it well.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.360
What are the approaches to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.140
valuing a company?

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.720
The value of your assets, the

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.960
market value we can obtain

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.440
using the comparable multiple,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.200
the discount of cash

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.900
flows.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.240
Well, since all the above are

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.280
the approaches we have seen in

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.300
the course to evaluate a company.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.980
The PER measures the relationship between

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.480
the price of the stock, price,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.300
earning, ratio, the price of the

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.520
stock and the profits.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.980
It is convenient that you understand

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.880
what PER is because it is a

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.000
very common multiple.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.580
What are the non-commercial companies

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.060
that are used?

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.440
The PER is usually used many multiple,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.060
but well, let's put two.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.480
The PER is usually used more for listed

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.820
companies because we are talking about

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.960
the price of the stock.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.800
In non-cotted companies it is very

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.420
common to use a multiple on EBITDA,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.600
which can be, because imagine,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.430
that they are companies that

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.810
are indebted.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.490
If, while you do not exceed

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.030
a certain level of risk, yes,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.030
because leverage increases

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.330
ROE, both are correct.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.970
They are very related.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.410
What happens with leverage

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.650
is that it increases profitability

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.830
over own funds, but of course,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.410
if you are leveraging, borrowing

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.150
too much, you are taking

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.870
an excessive risk.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.550
So, to that point, the values

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.750
are easier to apply, because

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.610
it is easier to apply the comparable

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.950
multiple.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.170
What is the value of the current net value?

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.050
The economic value created by an

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.170
investment in monetary units and

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.450
given a discount rate, the profitability

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.730
of an investment.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.270
The return on investment is

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.250
TIR, measured in percentage.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.370
The value is the economic value.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.510
If we increase the discount

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.530
rate, the VAN, what happens?

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.810
decreases or increases.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.770
We have seen it before.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.670
The Van is decreasing.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.210
We are demanding higher returns and

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.770
the net current value of that

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.050
investment is lower.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.420
The TIR is the discount rate that

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.580
makes the VAN zero, correct.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.040
In a high-risk investment, we should

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.860
require a higher or lower TIR,

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.840
if higher.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.460
If you face a high-risk investment,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.580
you have to demand a

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.000
higher return, right?
