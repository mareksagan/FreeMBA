00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.960
Niche strategy is something I think

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.940
we all have to understand

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.040
well because it has a number

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.940
of advantages.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.720
Let us see them.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.920
And we have...

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.440
This is the best option in many cases.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.540
Focus on a niche, a very

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.640
specific customer person.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.420
Let's compare two proposals, right?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960
We will compare Deport Village,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.900
which is an e-commerce where

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700
you can buy sports equipment,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.980
etc., of many different categories,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.080
of many sports.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.360
And we'll compare it to our

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.040
Padel, which in this case is

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.340
specialized in Padel.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.840
This is a niche strategy.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.180
It is directed to a customer person,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.700
who are the fans of the Padel.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.520
So what are the advantages?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.940
We will relate it to this example,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.140
but it is that they are the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.280
advantages that always apply

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.900
when you go to a niche, when

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.340
you specialize in a very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.460
specific customer person.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.740
We could summarize it with one

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.700
word, which is focus.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.060
You focus, in this case, on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.160
the fans of the Padel.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.160
Only in them.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.780
You are not, say, wearing

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.160
up with fans of many

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.900
sports.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.340
So focusing leads you to being able

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.880
to know them better than anyone

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.420
else.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.480
Padel our, because the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.600
knowledge you will have of the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.720
Padel fans, what they like, the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.600
brands they value, what they are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.800
willing to pay, what they do,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.820
everything.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.540
You will know him better than anyone else in the world.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.440
If you had to address many

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.740
different customer persons,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.800
many different segments,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.780
it would be more complicated.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.520


00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.520
It also has advantages in

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.200
marketing.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.500
Because when you go to a niche,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.300
in relation to going to the mass

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.060
market, campaigns, etc.,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.720
where to find them, what channels

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120
to use, it is easier, because

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.020
they are located.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.360
Hanty is a platform that connects

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.200
cotos and organics with hunters.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.380
Well, it is he has to go to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.120
the hunters.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.840
It is easy to go to the hunters.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.820
But if instead, if they had to address

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.620
the entire population, then millions

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.820
would have to be spent on digital

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.260
marketing.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.000
But it is that hunters, it is easy

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.440
to locate them, is a very clear

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.160
example of niche.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.780
They are in groups, etc.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.840
Therefore, it has advantages in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.480
terms of marketing.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.560
You can do more laser marketing.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.180


00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.040
Another advantage is that you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.240
enter a niche, start competing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.720
in a niche, steal market share

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.860
there, because you know the customers

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.040
and the big players, the general

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.060
competitors, the category

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.300
killers, whatever.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.440
You are a little boy

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.300
who is giving you a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.060
niche.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.280
To begin with, they are not able to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.620
compete with you because they don't know

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.560
that niche so well.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.520
For example, we have to say that,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.500
Depor Vilas versus Pa del Nuestro.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.860
Well, that is, in the end, that is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.960
the niche of bread of our own.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.280
Depor Villas offers products of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.760
all kinds.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.020
And as you are hurting

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.780
general competitors, but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.140
you are not competing

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.760
with them frontally,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.820
you are not facing

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.900
them frontally.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.580
Instead, if you face a category

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.840
killer first, because they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140
perceive much more threat,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.620
they will respond,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.040
etc.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.860
The result is that you will get to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.520
know your customers very well, that

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.880
it is easy to get to them, that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.800
you can...

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.160
Well, because what you can do when

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.360
you are in a niche is easier for you

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.040
to make yourself strong in that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.200
niche, until you can create up to

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.420
a monopoly, you can win a lot of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.900
market share with the advantages

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.540
you have that you have the best

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.280
in something, with all the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.980
advantages it has.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.360
Instead, if you want to enter with

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.500
a less segmented proposal,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.060
in many segments and others, it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.260
is that everything is much more

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.980
difficult.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.680
Win more difficult odds, meet

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.040
customers more difficult, etc.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.600
I think the advantages of the niche are

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.220
quite clear and there are cases where

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.120
it is the best recommendation

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.160
in the world.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.920
Especially when we are talking

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.760
about you will launch new products,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.560
new services, especially

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.700
when they are innovative, when

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.960
you are an entrepreneur, it is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.760
that the best, the best recommendation

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.660
is that you focus on

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.040
a very specific niche.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.360
So what is the key here?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.420
The key is what we are saying.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.600
You have to be able to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.280
identify and focus and focus

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.320
on a very specific, very

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.460
specific customer person

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.020
that you know very well.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.160
What do I mean by this?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.240
You have to know him, you have

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.800
to know what it hurts, what they

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.340
think of you, what they want

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.700
in life, I don't know how you

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.500
make the decisions.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.740
You have to know it perfectly,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.820
that niche, because that's what

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.120
you're focusing on.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.380
And it's that the rest, you haven'

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.640
t segmented so much, is not able

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.600
to put so much focus because

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.780
it's shooting everyone.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.800
So the key is that.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.760
The key is to focus on a niche

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.880
or a very, very, very, very

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.700
specific customer person.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.900
The more specific, the better.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.440
And as you can see, we're not talking

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.100
about being specific in terms of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.740
demographic variables and so, no,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.040
no, no.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.780
We have to have done the duties

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.480
well before, remember the segmentation.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.660
The customer person we have to have

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.880
understood very well and we

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.020
have to put a lot of focus on it.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160
Let's take an example, right?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.180
Let us compare the proposals.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.460
Imagine you are entering the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.680
market of lawyers.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.720
You can focus on

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.980
a niche for startups.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100
A lawyer's office that also helps

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.000
in very specific things like raising

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.800
capital.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.320
You are getting strong there.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.500
And the big Garrigues offices and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.280
others, well, you don't do much

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.900
harm to them.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.140
They have people, but they

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.060
are not experts.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.180
You can give him a few teeth.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.440
The Real Estate Agency.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.040
The Madrid group of my friend Genaro.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.180
Well, because he was also a generalist

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.100
real estate agency and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.380
what he decided is to specialize

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.740
in a very specific niche

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.980
in transfer of hostel locations.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.680


00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.700
And since he decided that, he made that

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.440
pivot, he made that strategic

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.500
decision and he is much better off

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.720
because he is the one who knows

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.900
this best in the world.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.200
He knows the players, knows

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.960
what it hurts, can advance,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.240
is aware of all operations,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.680
etc.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.580
This is a very clear

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.900
niche strategy.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.300
We'll think of the consultancy sector,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.760
the offices that have thousands

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.100
of services.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.900
And now we will think of one company

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.140
that is Noll Consulting, of my

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.280
friend Eduardo Bustamante, which

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.820
is specialized in a very

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.620
specific service, which is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.300
savings in the IBI, in the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.640
real estate tax.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.140
They make a cadastral assessment,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.760
identify errors and help

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.520
companies that have real estate

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.980
assets save on the payment

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.800
of the IBI every year.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.120
Find out what a more brutal specialization.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.460
But it's that of course, as they've

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.760
specialized in that and don't do more

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.580
things, they're the best in this.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.380
The best ones.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.820
And they have become leaders and there

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.860
is no one because they have created

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.120
almost a monopoly on this.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.860
The Carnival.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.960
The carnival usually offers

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.920
everything.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.820
Well, a Rioja carnicer, Pepe

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.520
Chuletón, has specialized in

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520
Chuletón.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.320
Brilliant brand positioning,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.120
brilliant specialization.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.960
Well, because a brand has been created

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.400
there and grows much more than

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.920
any carnage thanks to this,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.220
thanks to understanding well

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.700
the niche strategy of specialization.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.740
More of examples?

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.460
I do not know.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.360
We'll think about the sector of astreries,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.680
fashion, costumes on a custom,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.320
etc.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.180
Absolute Spoke by Tommy Lasso.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.120
Well, because he is specialized in

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.240
a specific niche, in a specific

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.960
personal cast that is people, because

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.280
that, who likes fashion a lot,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.760
with purchasing power and more.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.580
And Tommy understands himself better than anyone.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.140
They understand them like no one else

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.580
in the world.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.260
It is impossible to compete with Tommy there.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.540
It is the result of that.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.500
It is the result that he has focused on

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.900
a very specific niche and there he does

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.440
not throw anyone.
