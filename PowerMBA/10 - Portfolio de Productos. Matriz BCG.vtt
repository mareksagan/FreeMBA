00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.670
Let's talk about the famous BCG

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.070
matrix.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.550
BCG is the acronym for Boston

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.590
Consulting Group.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.950
Boston Consulting Group is one of

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.570
the three most prestigious strategic

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.270
consultants in the world, along

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.910
with McKinsey and Bain.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.070
The matrix is this.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.210
You may know it, but I'm almost

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.510
sure that at some point you'

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.070
ll have heard of the concepts

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.270
that come out of this matrix

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.190
such as star products, dairy

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.570
products, interrogations,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.290
dogs, etc.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.420
Well, the first thing I want

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.740
you to consider is what this

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.760
matrix is for or how it is used.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.540
In general, what we do is use

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.860
the matrix to rank your

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.940
product, your product portfolio

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400
or business lines if you have

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
several.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.020
And from this analysis or this

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.700
classification within the matrix

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.920
allows us to make decisions.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.700
These are very strategic decisions.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.740
Decides how, in which product I

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.040
should continue to invest, I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.140
should focus, or where I should

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.220
invest, or I have my diversified

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.620
portfolio, or for example,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.920
which products I should abandon,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.460
in which products I should

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.700
de-invest.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.500
These are decisions of this type.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.780
Let's start by analyzing the matrix,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.920
to see how it is structured.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.760
As we all know, the matrix has

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.180
two axes.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.280
We will begin by analyzing the axis of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.320
the X, which is the horizontal axis.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.420
What we will do is classify

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.280
our products according to

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.820
the market share we have for

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.120
each of those products on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.940
the X axis.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.580
And in the axis of the Y, what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.780
we will do is to classify our

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.340
products according to whether

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.060
the market in which that product

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.260
is present is a market that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.980
is growing or not growing.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.500
From these two axes, we

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.020
have four blocks.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.120
By the way, there is another perspective

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.660
that is very related to these two

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.960
axes that we will go see when we

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.380
analyze each of the blocks, which

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.820
is the generation or consumption

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.420
of cash or treasury.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.100
For example, in markets that are

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.260
growing, the needs for investment,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.100
for treasury consumption are higher

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.480
because you have to invest

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.820
to grow or at least it is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.220
convenient that you invest

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.880
to grow.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.760
Or, if we are talking about the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.980
axis of the Y, when you have a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.720
higher market share, in principle

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.040
what you get is that those,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.080
those products are generators

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.920
of treasury, are more profitable,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.640
otherwise said.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.480
Now we will go into detail on each

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.260
of the quadrants of the matrix

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.300
and what is more important is

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.520
that we analyze what a company'

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.940
s strategy has to be in relation

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.900
not only to each of them but

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.440
to the entire portfolio.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.220
Let us start with the questions.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880
The questions, in addition to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040
their name we explain well, are the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.920
products in which we have not

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.140
yet had success, we still

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.100
have a low market share, but it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.940
is true that they are in

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.120
markets that are growing.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.140
You will understand this if you see examples.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.920
For example, smartwatches, smartwatches

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.600
within the watch market still

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.920
have a very low share,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920
but it is growing.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.960
Another clear example is

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.880
still electric cars,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.400
clearly the electric car,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.240
the market share on the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.500
total car sales is very

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320
small yet, but is

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.740
clearly a growing trend.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.500
Well, this type of business, the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.560
interrogations, are in which they

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.440
are not very profitable, still

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.860
a lot of development is needed,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.320
there is a lot of uncertainty,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.700
there is a lot of risk,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.400
etc.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.840
But the opportunity is also very big.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.200
So here the question is,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.980
well, how do we handle the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.700
questions?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.060
What is what we have to do?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.020
There are basically two conclusions.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.320
The first is that you have to have

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.960
products that are questioning, because

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.720
that is the leverage to innovate,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.960
the leverage to diversify.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.520
The lever, the real lever for

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.920
in the future to get to have

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.160
stars, don't stay behind.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.420
We will reinforce that later.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.340
And in addition, with each of

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.020
the questions you have, what you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.260
have to do is invest, there

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.820
is no other.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.080
These are that if you want to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.020
grow you have to invest in.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.020
And bear in mind that many of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.840
them will fail and others will succeed.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.540
By pure statistics, some will

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.300
become stars and others

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.960
will become dogs.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.420
But it always requires investment

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.400
and risk.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.720
And we go with the next of the

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.920
quadrants, which are the stars.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.400
These are products in which we

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.980
have achieved a considerable

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.540
market share, but the market

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.960
continues to grow.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.640
I will give you examples.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.660
Facebook has a market share,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.080
it is after Google the second

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.960
player in the market of online

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.440
advertising platforms and at

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.880
the aggregate level as well.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.840
And it's also that it has a good

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.860
position, it's that it's also

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.680
a market that is growing very

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.120
much, it's one of the biggest stars

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.700
that exists in the world.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.140
Netflix as well.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.680
Netflix has a good market share

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.000
in a growing market.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.580
Same with Cavify.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.980
These are three clear examples of stars.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.660
So here the question is,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.160
well, when we get to have

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.480
a star, what is it we

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.980
have to do?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.300
How should we manage it?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.820
Well, the key is that you have

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.260
to invest strongly or

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.580
aggressively to grow.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.240
And I will explain why.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.280
You have in mind, and we also

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.840
saw it when we studied the product

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.940
life cycle, you have in mind

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.980
that markets do not grow

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.240
indefinitely.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.580
There comes a time when markets

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.240
are stagnant, mature.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.060
So what you have to do when

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.600
you have a star is invest

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.560
heavily to reach the highest market

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.960
share possible so that when

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.160
that time comes when the market

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.480
matures you have the best

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.840
position.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.360
I also want you to keep in mind that

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.300
the risk of investing in stars

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.100
is lower than the risk of

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.980
investing in questions.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.060
Well, because the uncertainty

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.340
is less.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.840
Now let's get the next

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.940
quarter that is natural

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.340
dairy cows.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.320
And I say it naturally because

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.680
the stars end up becoming

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.740
dairy cows.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.420
Milk cows are the or

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.180
products from which we

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.880
live the vast majority of.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.460
They are in which you have reached

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.580
a good position, which are not growing,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.100
that they are not growing anymore

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.220
and that, well, because you are

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.260
comfortable, it is a mature market,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.900
it is a market you know, it generates

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.340
treasury, it does not require

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.880
additional investments, you do not

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.260
need to invest much more, you already

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.660
have your market share.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.720
Examples of milk cows.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.080
The iPhone or iPad, that

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.480
many of you Apple has a

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.620
good market share in both,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.380
in tablets and smartphones,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.640
but they are not markets

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.080
that grow a lot.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.560
Home, in mature markets yes, forgiveness,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.160
in unmature markets, or

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.700
in emerging markets, forgiveness.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.940
Or Coca-Cola, for example, is

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.980
one of the milk cows, well,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.340
the most well-known that there is,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.360
or McDonald's, for example.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.940
Almost all of our households

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.600
live from dairy cows.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.940
What do you do

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.920
with a cow?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.700
It is very simple.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.040
All you have to do is to harvest the

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.420
cow and generate treasure.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.500
What we need to keep in mind is

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.920
that we should invest that treasury

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.820
permanently in innovation,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.440
in searching for questions,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.780
etc., or in accelerating

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.120
the growth of stars.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.680
And we go to the last of the

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.460
quadrants, which are in which, well,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.020
our share is low, that is, it has

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.400
not gone well, and in addition

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.080
it is that it results that the market

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.220
is declining, that this is the

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.560
most important thing of all.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.980
Markets are not growing.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.220
For many reasons, it may be

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.620
because customers' tastes have

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.960
changed, or because new technologies

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.300
have entered, etc.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.080
Examples are always well understood.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.700
The MP3 is a dog, or the

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.420
video clubs are a dog.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.240
So what do we do with

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.940
the dogs?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.400
Well, there are really different

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.420
situations here.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.460
Imagine, you may be selling

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.440
MP3 and it's not really consuming

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.960
you treasury.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.060
Well, you're earning some

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.000
money, or at least you're not losing it.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.500
If the situation is this, well,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.260
because it may not be so urgent that

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.640
you abandon that business line,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.440
or that you disinvest, but if

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.120
what is happening is that you are

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.560
consuming resources, you are losing

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.360
money, or it still requires you

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.200
some focus or too much focus

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.420
of the organization, because of

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.380
the management, etc., because

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.360
there is always an opportunity

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840
cost, what you have to do

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.920
is kill the dog, what you have

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.480
to do is disinvest, without

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.220
looking at that business line.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.200
We will look at the matrix again

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.300
and we will make a look at the movements.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.110
We have to invest in questions

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.190
and what we should do

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.310
is have a diversified

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.530
portfolio of questions.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:52.870
Why is it?

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.390
Because a percentage of them

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.290
will become dogs and

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.610
a percentage will become stars.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.310
The stars, we have to keep investing

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.650
the stars as the risk is lower

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.810
to win the highest market

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.350
share possible knowing that

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.170
someday they will be dairy cows.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.450
The milk cows we have to do

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.710
is order them and the longer

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.650
the better.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.590
And that treasury is the engine, it

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.930
is gasoline, let's say, more

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.110
than the engine, it is gasoline that

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.950
will allow us to invest

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.330
in questions, go looking for new

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.210
lines of business or accelerate

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.910
the growth of stars.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.790
And to finish, I will share with

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.670
you two common mistakes in the

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.890
strategy of many companies.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.490
One is to live in excess of

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.210
dairy cows and sure if you

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.590
analyze business you know

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.850
is too common this.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.750
Innovating little is basically innovating

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.530
little.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.410
The companies do what they do is, well,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.550
because they have a product that gives

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.230
them money and point.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.350
But what you have to do is

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.670
be constantly looking for

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.230
questions because that's the

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.370
only way you'll ever get

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.170
a star back.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.850
Companies that do this well?

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.530
by Amazon.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.190
Amazon has also sometimes been

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.830
criticized because this policy

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.510
is extreme.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.370
It has been permanently

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.150
investing in new business

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.630
lines, buying companies,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.530
etc., which has in some

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.610
cases lastered cash flow, lastered

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.330
results, has lastered

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.810
sometimes the quote, etc.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.990
What we do is be constantly

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.730
innovating.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.550
And all those you have

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.870
entered in some cases

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.510
will become stars and

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.250
future dairy cows.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.870
That is, therefore, the first of

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.270
the mistakes, the first of the

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.430
conclusions is that you have

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.630
to permanently focus on looking

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.170
for new questions, even

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.550
though there is risk.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.170
And two, what you can't do

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.450
is get overly caressed with dogs.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.470
You can't allow your products

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.430
or business lines that aren't

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.350
growing, that aren't contributing

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.770
in excess, that don't have a

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.070
future, to hurt your business.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.650
What you have to do in these cases

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.050
is to disinvest.
