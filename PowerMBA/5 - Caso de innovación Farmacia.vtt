00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.240
In the previous class, Carlos

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.220
described the business model of

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.920
a pharmacy.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400
And as I told you and have told

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.120
you many times, this is not

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.660
just about defining it, but what

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.800
we have to do is to analyze

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420
it, to bring conclusions

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.100
to try to innovate or evolve

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
it, to have some advantage.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.680
So, Carlos, what I propose to

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600
you is that you do an analysis, but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.100
a more or less summarized analysis,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.860
an executive summary, that you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.580
choose some of the blocks that

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.960
you talked to us yesterday about

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.700
Canvas and star some conclusion.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.240
Explain a little about the methodology.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.320
We need to understand the methodology

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.040
a little.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.100
How is this analysis?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.180
very well.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.440
It is about taking advantage of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.380
the graphic form that we have in

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.860
the Canvas to go analyzing our business

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.440
model for each of the blocks

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.760
and seeing if in that block we have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.460
a strength that we could

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.680
take advantage of to evolve

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620
our model or a weakness that we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.680
should think how to solve

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880
it in the face of the evolution

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.500
of the model or both, as we

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.880
will see in the two examples

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.660
that I will put.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.920
This would have to be done in

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.180
all blocks, but we will do it in

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.160
two specifics to show, as you

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.780
say Borja, the methodology.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.000
The first one we will analyze

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.520
is the revenue flow of our

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.760
pharmacy business model, which

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.280
we saw consisted only of a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.760
flow that was the sale of

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.320
products.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.540
This has a weakness from my point

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.760
of view, regardless of whether

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.560
that flow was greater or lesser.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.900
There are pharmacies that break

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.520
a lot and yet I still see a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700
weakness in that revenue flow.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.080
Why is it?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.340
For two main reasons.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.380
First is because they only sell

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.680
products and the lack of selling

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.760
services, which would be

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.240
another additional possibility,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.940
complicates customer loyalty,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.060
which we can offer a

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.000
different customer experience.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.420
The transaction sale of a product is

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.540
very difficult to differentiate

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.300
from another pharmacy office.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.320
And a second very important reason

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.580
from my point of view that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.940
turns a weakness of this block

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.260
is the lack of recurrence.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.940
A pharmacy office only earns

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.980
when it sells products, so that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.380
it does so in a transactional

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.700
and non-recurrent way,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.480
as we might think, for example,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.820
in other business models,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.320
such as a gym that enters

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.300
monthly, regardless

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.620
of the use they make of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.060
its services to customers.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.280
I agree with your analysis and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.520
will add two things.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.140
One of the things I said was that they

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.900
didn't sell services.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.660
I am not an ordinary customer of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.180
the pharmacy but from the common

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.540
sense I think they are losing

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.700
an enormous opportunity because

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.780
with the relationship they have

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.440
with customers, I think it is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.360
a business model in which you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.540
could incorporate certain sales

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.980
of services.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.620
And with regard to recurrence, we'll

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.080
talk a lot about recurrence in

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.480
this course of business models

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.340
because it's one of the key

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.960
factors to analyze in the revenue

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.120
flow and in general in a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.920
business model.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.440
It is very convenient to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.380
seek recurrence.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.080
Have you called the gym?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.740
Well, it is that in particular

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.260
we will analyze the business

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.480
model of a chain of gyms and one

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180
of the conclusions we will

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.640
get is that the huge recurrence,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.720
the recurrence of its positive,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.300
that has other negatives,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.280
but in the case of the gym

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.820
the fact that all its customers

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.700
pay in a recurring way

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.080
is clearly that it is a clear

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.140
strength.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.460
So we go, totally agree.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.480
That is, it guarantees

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.060
us a monthly income,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.660
recurrently and also predictably.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.720
That is the prediction, indeed.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.080
It is very good to be able to do this because

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.080
we are going to get to the next block.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.520
The next block we will analyze

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.080
as an example is that of

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.180
customer segments.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.620
In this case, you see a duality.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.280
On the one hand, a strength in this

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.160
segment of customers, remember the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.540
neighbors, because they are customers

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.420
that we know and know us, who

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.040
trust us and that therefore

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.640
could allow us to grow within

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.680
that segment to the extent

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.900
that we provide proposals from

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.860
different people within the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.880
neighbors.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.000
Totally agree.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.340
At the same time I see that there may

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.940
be a certain weakness or need for improvement,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.920
I would say, in this segment.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.900
It is true that it is a group

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.540
of neighbors we know and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.680
know, but we are talking about

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.420
their volume of a small segment.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.020
On average, a pharmacy in Spain

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.780
has about 2,150 inhabitants.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.740
If we consider that it does not reach

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.440
23,000 pharmacies for a total

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.380
of 45 million inhabitants.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.940
Therefore, it is a segment that

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.280
could grow based on capturing customers

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.280
from several around or other

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.000
areas.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.540
That's what we should think about

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.080
how to address possible developments.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.260
I'll add something about what

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.820
the target audience is the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.960
people living around.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.000
It is something that is

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.500
common in of this type where

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.880
one of the key resources

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.180
is the store or installation.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.860
It is very common, in retail for

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.980
example it is common, but we will

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.620
see a case, we will analyze the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.520
case of one of the students

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.440
who has an installation of football

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.200
fields in their own.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.240
Then we will see the same

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.820
conclusion as pharmacies, which

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.880
is that in the end your customer

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.660
segment is limited by pure geography

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.060
and that is clearly a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.780
weakness.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.880
In the case of the pharmacy even more

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.120
because you are telling me that in

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.800
the end they are directed by half if

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.140
they share the whole cake that is Spain.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.320
Among the pharmacies there are at

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.600
the end you come out because I don't

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.940
know how many you said but very few

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.160
very few inhabitants.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.920
Effectively but at the same time as we

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.940
will see it implies a possibility of

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.100
improvement, this weakness can be reduced

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.960
by thinking of offering something

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.700
differentiated to our customers or

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.800
potential customers.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.060
No one will move from one pharmacy

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.020
to another from a nearby village

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.360
or neighborhood to buy an aspirin,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.060
but if you see in our pharmacy

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.440
a differentiated value proposal

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.180
we will be able to attract

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.160
audiences from other

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.740
geographies.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.940
Great, because what we can do

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.100
now is from you to propose us some

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.000
idea or some possible evolution

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.560
aimed at reducing them

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.460
or building on the fortress

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.940
as you prefer.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.180
That is, that is the idea in this

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.780
methodology, think about possible

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.060
evolutions and then how we will see it moderate.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.420
If we take back the block of

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.740
income flows in which we saw

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.920
that weakness was two basically,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.820
the lack of sales of services

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.900
and recurring income, I think

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.840
the feeling of certain health

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.760
control services, for example

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.800
think of the third age, to

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.180
which we could offer a service

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.200
of monitoring its basic

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.760
constants, for example blood

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.520
pressure, temperature,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.820
blood glucose level, etc.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.160
Through the payment of a small

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.320
but recurring monthly fee that

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.540
would allow to provide the

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.320
third age to our elders a quincennal

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.840
or monthly surveillance service.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.540
I think the pharmacy is

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.120
perfectly trained to provide

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.180
that service and help the national

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.400
health system in the primary

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.920
care process.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.660
Well I absolutely think that in

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.720
addition customers would be willing

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.660
to pay for it, that you already

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.940
build on a relationship of much trust

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.360
with that type of customers, it

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.520
seems to me that it has all the

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.380
sense of the world.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.820
Is there a pharmacy that does

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.300
it?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.100
Well, as such now not, because

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.680
I know I have formed hundreds of pharmacists,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.440
I suppose that some of them to

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.880
whom I have proposed this type

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.660
of models because they have not

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.560
put in place, I don't know if

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.380
it has been so.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.780
What is true is that there are

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.580
more and more pharmacies that

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.920
are incorporating wellness

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.780
services and the next step of

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.880
turning it into something recurrent

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.060
is relatively easy.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.220
Well Carlos to palliate or to overcome

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.780
the weakness that you had identified

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.060
and is that the customer

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.140
segment is small, because in

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.200
the end you have to address

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.740
people around, what do you

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.420
propose?

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.490
Well I see two possible growth

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.770
pathways, even being a small

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.650
segment we can grow within the

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.630
segment and we can also grow

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.310
by seeing customers, new customers

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.870
outside the neighboring

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.210
segment.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.630
In the first case, growing within

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.850
the being small, 2,150 inhabitants

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.190
on average per pharmacy, half

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.670
of them approximately are men

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.990
and the pharmacy has no clear

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.450
proposal of value towards it.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.270
Men are increasingly taking care of

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.170
themselves but are doing so in

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.730
the gym, in the hairdressing,

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.270
in sports stores, on social networks.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.390
What better site than the pharmacy

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.270
to offer a comprehensive service

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:50.530
of editing, capillary, etc?

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.210
If we think of growing in new customer

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.130
segments, we could be focusing on

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.870
aspects such as runners, people

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.270
who like to take care of themselves,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.830
who do sports, the third age,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.110
mature women, insofar as our

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.710
pharmacy offered a specific

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.130
value proposal for these

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.690
segments we would undoubtedly

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.430
attract audiences from other

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.530
neighborhoods around or

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.910
symbolizing villages.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.610
Perfect, that is, on the one hand

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.970
you propose within without coming out

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.390
of within the neighbors for example

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.830
identify a segment in which you can

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.510
grow, that are already customers yours

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.470
but that like the men and you adapt

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.250
your proposal and you will grow

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.890
in them or establish or design

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.550
a value proposal very adapted to

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.310
for example to runners you said

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.230
and that that allows you to attract

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.990
customers that are out of your

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.850
logical field of action.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.230
This is to attract audiences from other segments.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.290
I always say that we should

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.210
think of this even if it was

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.070
only defensive if we are not

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.690
those who attract audiences

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.730
from other neighborhoods

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.410
or neighborhoods will be others

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.510
who do and we will be

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.690
those who see that our

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.250
customers go toward these

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.590
alternative business models.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.910
This is what they say, the

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.270
best defense is a good attack,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.830
right?

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.330
Or something like that.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.970
Effectively, and especially giving

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.990
the first, which creates a major

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.730
entry barrier.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.750
Effectively, good because from here

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.470
what we will do is choose one

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.990
of the ideas you have raised and

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.130
we will develop it in more detail.
