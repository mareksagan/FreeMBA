WEBVTT

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.530
Minimum viable product, you define

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.490
the metrics very well, you start measuring

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.430
it and there comes a moment when you

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.070
say, well, this makes a lot of sense,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.830
because the metrics are demonstrating

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.330
it to me and at that moment I understand

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.710
that, well, you have reached

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.310
Product Market Fit or there would

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.870
be things that you did not have yet

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.430
validated and so, does more funding

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.630
come in or how do you do it?

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.770
How can you give them?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.650
Yes, exactly, I think that more

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.530
and more the business angel sector,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.170
the going to reach a level of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.830
financing is always more and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.570
more dynamic.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.610
What does that mean?

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.550
I don't do one round now in two years,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.810
I do another and I do one hour

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.790
of a million and in a year or a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.530
half I do another of five, no.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.750
That is, more and more what we see

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.690
is that, especially in a B2C business,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.190
where there are many things to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.550
validate, more and more are rounds

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.630
more successive but smaller, where

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.230
each of them is or tries to validate

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.790
a thesis, a milestone, yes, a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.910
steak to which you have come,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.810
and that has been in our case, more

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.370
and more, and that is a little

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.130
in relation to risk, that is, in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.510
the end raising money at first

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.390
or raising a lot of money at first

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.250
will cost you a valuation for

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.530
your lower business status

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.570
and also you probably don'

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.930
t need that money.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.290
We have always preferred to make

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.810
smaller rounds, suitable for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.990
a certain valuation and go to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.230
do more successive rounds.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.530
In the end if you have internal investors

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.430
who are happy with the business,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.310
because you are demonstrating

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.410
an evolution, they are accompanying

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
you for a certain part of the company'

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.190
s life, obviously there

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170
is a certain time when it is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.170
no longer for them that stage

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.910
of investment and other players

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.470
enter, but those others can

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.730
also accompany you for

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.070
a while.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.030
What phase are you now, that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.850
is, if we already draw,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.610
take advantage and draw all the...

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.450
Yes, we formed the company two

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.470
years ago, we launched the product

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.770
to the market a year ago and ten

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.250
months or less and now we are

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.270
in Spain as markets, we are in

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.010
Spain, we are in Italy and we

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.470
are in the UK and at the level of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.970
rounds, as you commented,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.310
we have done several, we have

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.190
done from Friends and Family,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.730
from...

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.190
And if we identify the rounds, as

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.310
you said, the different milestones

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.030
or stages, how would Friends

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.050
and Family be for the first validation

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.770
of the idea?

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.130
Friends and Family to validate the idea

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.210
and validate the team, and there is

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.870
one that I will tell you in each phase.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.950
Then there would be the Sit phase, where

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.490
it is validation already with first

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.590
market metrics, that is, there is a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.690
product fit with the market and in that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.250
case the Spanish market.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.430
Then you make a presery where...

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.530
Sorry, we are still in the team.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.870
In the pressery there is a phase of bringing

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.710
this to other countries on the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.510
international side.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.270
What is the importance of this presence?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.370
Can you tell us later if not?

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.370
The prize was 3 million, the sit-

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.090
on-one series, Friends and Family

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.030
small from 40 to 100 thousand

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.430
euros.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.230
And then, as I said, I would press internationalization

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.790
of business and we continue

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.030
with team.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.830
And then we did a series just three

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.070
months ago, and that would be of

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.310
greater amount.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.550
Basically what we try to validate

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.470
is, you have a product that

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.830
you know how to launch it to new

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.590
countries, you have a product

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.090
that retains users, you

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.950
have a product that grows quite

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.250
organically, or we will replicate

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.790
that in other countries.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.470
And being able to increase talent

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.410
within the team, to have

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.510
better knowledge, etc.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.520
I said there is a cross

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.740
that is the team.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.920
And in fact, if you have had

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.360
the opportunity to talk to some VCs

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.180
partners or if you have it, I think

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.280
ask it and you will see that there

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.880
is always the team part.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.960
And that is very well seen with

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.680
second entrepreneurs who have had

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.820
success in their first or

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.580
previous experiences, as the part

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.920
above all of getting funding

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.420
and much higher speeds.
