WEBVTT

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.290
I have a question and it is related

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.630
to the general platform model

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.890
that there is an initial challenge in

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.870
growth, which we call the challenge

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.950
of the bite and the chicken, which

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.770
is to break that network effect, that

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.330
when you already have a lot of critical

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.470
mass benefits you because you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650
generate very much value, but when

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.870
you were curling at McKinsey

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.250
and you started with this minimum

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.910
viable product is very complicated,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.090
with very few users it is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.290
very complicated to generate value.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.410
That is, it’s a bit the chicken of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.550
the golden eggs, that is, the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.950
network effects in a marketplace.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.790
The chicken of the golden eggs

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.830
when you are up.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.690
The key is to know how to do

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.610
it from the beginning.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.330
That is, we call it the challenge

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.270
of the Exact.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.930
And there you can try using

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.910
several tools to try to encourage

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.790
it instead of it in the 5

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.670
month from the beginning.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.510
But it’s true that until you have

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.530
a minimum mass of content users

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770
on the platform, that doesn’

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.210
t work.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.330
This is drawn as a virtuous

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.150
circle, that the more users you

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.370
have more value when you have

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.790
already reached that critical mass

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.010
that generates an entry

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.530
barrier for others.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.670
But when you don’t have any one, it’s very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.690
complicated because if there are two

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.930
users on 21 buttons, you don’t generate

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.950
value for either of the two and the rest.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.190
How did you get that

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.470
initial attraction?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.750
From the beginning it grows very fast.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.830
That is, if I can get that

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.450
entry barrier or that critical

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.190
mass in, I will try to

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.850
get in that month what I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.430
need to create it.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.170
That during that month those users

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.990
won’t have the best retention in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.930
the best coefficient of virtuality?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.370
Totally agree.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.210
Do you use a specific

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.310
strategy?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.770
See also that...

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.010
Look, they told me, for example, I was

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.250
told by José del Barrio Fundador de

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.270
la Névera Roja, he told us that they

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.490
had done what they had done is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.870
to focus on one, that is, to win the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.050
critical mass in concrete niches, in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.050
concrete cities or in concrete neighborhoods,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.230
even in concrete neighborhoods

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.330
they had done.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.090
They give value to the rest.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.050
In the case of the Red Nevers,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.010
they generated value to restaurants and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.330
customers within that neighborhood,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.990
but had already reached the critical

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.410
mass within the neighborhood.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.810
Yes, in our case it is to try

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.150
to have a minimum critical mass

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.130
of content, so what you try, in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.250
principle, if you compare a little

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.670
with the similarity to what José

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.050
del Barrio said, is to create

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.310
the minimum critical mass of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.530
few content creators.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.990
So try to have few good content

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.550
creators, so that the day I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.910
download the app, the first

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.710
day, I already see quality

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.690
content.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.070
It is worth, that is, that the strategy

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.330
in this case goes by capturing

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.410
users that are very referential and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.490
that are very generated content.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.530
For example, Twenty did the same, or

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.810
Facebook, what it did is start with

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.970
people who were studying Harvard and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.310
who were very aspirational for the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.050
rest of the world.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.990
That is how he got that traction.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.330
So what you did is focus

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.730
on very valuable users.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.610
and exact.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.330
And those users, in the end, what

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.310
you generate is that you have

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.270
a platform with very good

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.750
experience and that the other

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.610
users who enter will stay,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.190
will share more, will go up

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.590
more.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.030
It’s what you commented, that’

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.930
s generating that wheel that’

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.950
s what we, as you said, call

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.030
the network effects.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.230
And in our sense, in our products

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.830
you see a lot as better content,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.890
with more users, you have more

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.610
retention, you have more engagement,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.670
you can really measure

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.130
very well.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.850
You can measure how metrics improve

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.670
thanks to the network effect,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.090
right?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.710
and totally.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.150
And this is what it does is that, having

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.090
reached a point like that you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.230
are now, where you are already,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.730
that critical mass has already been

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.190
reached, the barrier to entry is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.490
huge for those outside.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.490
It is super complicated.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.670
It’s much bigger, the challenge is much

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.690
bigger than you’ve faced yourself

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.830
the first day, because it’s not just

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.910
that they have to break the egg and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.810
the chicken, but the challenge is

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.030
the initial problem, but they also

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.970
have to compete with one that’s already

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.830
implanted, that is, it’s

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.670
impossible directly.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.090
and exact.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.850
And that’s what makes companies

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.850
like yours, the valuations

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.430
are so much higher.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.290
and exact.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.990
Yes, yes, you have defined

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.110
it perfectly.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.370
There are quite a few players

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.910
who have tried to do the same

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.430
thing we are doing and that hasn’t

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.110
worked, basically, because at the moment

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.310
you have a minimum critical mass,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.570
it’s impossible to move that mass

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.770
to the other platform,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.310
it’s impossible.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.210
Who would be the first to say I am

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.770
going?

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.550
And they’ll follow everyone else, and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.030
then when they’re here they’ll

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.690
create content.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.930
If not, who will see

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.910
this content?

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.510
Of course, effectively, the barriers

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.950
to entry, this effect that is given

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.110
on the platforms, in social networks,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.430
etc., in a marketplace is

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.430
given because there is all the supply

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.410
and all the demand.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.270
For example, think of the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.170
Idealist, which we analyzed yesterday.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.890
But in the case of content-centric

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.190
platforms, it’s also content,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.250
not only the millions of

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.270
people you have, but

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.290
it’s the content that’

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.030
s wrapped inside.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.410
And for example, we were analyzing

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.190
TripAdvisor, for example, and you say,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.430
on TripAdvisor, in the case of the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.030
entry barrier, not just that it’s

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.510
used by millions of people, no.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.250
The entry barrier is even greater.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.670
For many years, these millions

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.430
of people have wrapped hundreds

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.230
of millions of opinions.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.330
And those hundreds of millions

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.410
of opinions are a barrier that is

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.650
already infranchisable.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.170
In your case it is similar.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.030
Maybe not like TripAdvisor, but

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.190
all that content generated...

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.870
It has a lot of value.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.170
Yes yes.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.350
That is, in the end you need

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.350
to convince people that they create

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.450
the content, that they go, that

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.970
they start consuming content on another

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.670
platform, that they will know that

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.570
they won’t have any views or purchases

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.410
during the first few days.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.230
I need to convince people

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.490
to view the content that

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.090
goes.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.470
That is, there are really many

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.470
factors that ultimately incite

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.930
to have powerful entry barriers.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.430
This is why we are looking to quickly

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.450
launch new markets.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.630
Yes indeed.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.310
I’m also looking at another similar

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.950
case of networking with entry

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.670
barriers, which is LinkedIn.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.430
And it’s not a matter of being everybody,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.470
but you’ve been rolling, for

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.930
years, you’ve curled the profile.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.630
Well, I don’t, but a lot of people have

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.290
done it, right?

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.990
And then now they put you up with the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.870
one that you start using another

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.110
professional network and gives you

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.970
a deadly lazy, because you have to start

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.550
creating your profile in another

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.570
professional network and all that content,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.810
because I know, recognitions that

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.850
have made you other people, etc.,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.930
that are more or less how it works.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.630
It is an insurmountable barrier to entry.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.250
It’s impossible, even before LinkedIn,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.070
for example, in Germany there’s one

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.170
called Ching, and even LinkedIn

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.830
has not been able to compete

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.790
with Ching within Germany.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.630
That is, they have really

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.530
built such barriers that the global

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.150
job network, which is LinkedIn,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.850
has failed to penetrate

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.670
Germany.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.410
Look at this, it is a very clear

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.370
example of what I am saying.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.710
That is, it’s really brutal to

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.790
generate content or all that legacy

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.310
that’s there as an entry barrier,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.630
isn’t it?

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.950
And then obviously there is the

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.810
whole issue of being top of mind

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.950
of people, etc., etc.
