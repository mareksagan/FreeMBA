00:05.000 --> 00:14.000
In addition to the accounting balance, at the beginning of the lecture we listed other documents related to financial accounting.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Other forms, forms 2, 3 and so on.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
They are smaller in volume than the accounting balance, less significant,

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
but nevertheless they sometimes contain information that is very valuable and used for financial accounting analysis.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
When we study the course Financial and Economic Analysis,

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
we will see that all forms, especially forms 2 and 4,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
actively use the information in them,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
which is needed to conduct financial analysis.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Now we will not dwell on these additional forms.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
You can read more about them in the supplement as additional material.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
And now we move on to our second question.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Our second question is about the financial results.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
We have a financial report,

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
and looking at this financial report, we should see what are the results of our enterprise.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
If an experienced financier asks,

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
what are the indicators, a huge number of financial indicators and coefficients,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
the most important ones when analyzing the financial results of the enterprise,

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
those that give the maximum information about the financial state of the enterprise,

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
will tell you that the indicators are profit and profitability.

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
Remember, profit and profitability are the most important indicators of the enterprise financial state.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
We will talk about them in more detail.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Profit is a part of the revenue of the enterprise,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
which is left after all the expenses are taken from it,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
which the enterprise has to pay for the revenue.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Profit is a rather multifaceted indicator.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
There are many different segments that can characterize profit.

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
In the slide you see only some indicators of profit

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
that can reflect the various aspects of the enterprise financial state.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Look at this slide.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
In the first place is the profit.

02:57.000 --> 03:07.000
The first step of the profit can be discussed in the financial analysis.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
The profit is obtained if the self-worth is subtracted from the revenue.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
It is clear that the profit, with all its value,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
is not reflected by all the aspects of the enterprise.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
If the commercial and administrative expenses are subtracted from the self-worth,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
without which it is impossible to make a profit,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
we will get a profit from the sale.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
It is less than the self-worth.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Of course, it is less.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
But without the administrative expenses, without the management of the enterprise,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
it would be impossible to get this profit.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
If the revenue from the sale is subtracted from the other revenues and expenses

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
that the enterprise has,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
which are associated with additional revenues or additional expenses,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
which we have already discussed today.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
For example, you took a loan for a percentage.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
After the term of the loan is over, you return the money and the percentage.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
You have additional expenses.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
You could also provide a loan or a loan.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You could take out loans.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
You could have additional expenses or revenues,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
not related to the main activity.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Revenues from the financial activity of your enterprise.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Taking into account these revenues and expenses,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
a profit is formed that is needed before the tax is paid.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
That is, a profit that will already be paid by the tax.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
And only after we subtract the taxes from the profit,

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
which are due to the payment of the tax on the profit,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
and subtract the deposited tax assets and obligations,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
which arise due to the fact that not all the profits

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
that the enterprise has are subject to taxation.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Not all.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
The tax code gives certain deductions,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
which must be made before the tax proceeds.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
So, if we carry out all the necessary operations,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
we will get the profit that is due to the tax,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
we will subtract the taxes from the tax,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
and we will get the most interesting part of the profit.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
A pure profit.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
A pure profit is the profit that is left with the enterprise,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
and which is the absolute property of the enterprise.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
An enterprise with a pure profit can do everything it considers necessary.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
There are no restrictions on the use of a pure profit.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
All taxes have been paid for it.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
All calculations have already been made with everyone.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
A pure profit is the property of the enterprise itself.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
A pure profit can be used for any needs of the enterprise,

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
including the payment of dividends to the owners of this enterprise,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
as a reward for the fact that they created this enterprise.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
The next indicator that characterizes the financial result is profitability.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
An important indicator,

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
an important indicator that is no less important than the profit itself.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Profitability, as an indicator, regardless of the enterprise's activities,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
reflects the efficiency of the enterprise.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Therefore, profitability is the effect of the enterprise's functioning

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
on the costs that had to be incurred to get this effect.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Any profitability is the effect of the costs.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And since various costs cause various effects,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
we can consider various segments of profitability.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Financiers consider many segments.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
In the slides, we present the most important segments

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
that arise when analyzing profitability.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
For example, profitability of the produced product.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
What costs were incurred?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The costs of manufacturing the product.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
These costs are the cost of production.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And what effect did they get?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
They got a profit from the sale.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
The relationship between profit and cost is the profitability of the produced product.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And we can make other variants of profitability based on this formula.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
For example, the profitability of sales.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
This is the relationship between profit and sales to revenue.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Revenue is the cost of getting this profit.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Or the profitability of the capital itself

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
The profitability of the capital itself shows how effectively the capital was invested in the business.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
The profitability of the capital itself is an indicator that is very interesting for the business owner.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
After all, for a businessman, the owner of the enterprise,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
it does not matter where he invested his capital.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
He has the widest range of investments.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
You can invest in different types of business.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In each, the profitability of the investment will be different.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Today, in our country, capital is not so easy to flow from one industry to another

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
to align the norm of profitability.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Therefore, the profitability is different.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And therefore, a businessman is interested, a real businessman,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
who invests capital not in the form of activity,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
but who invests capital in order to get a profit.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
He is interested in the profitability of the investment of this capital.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
He will be interested in his business and other types of business

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
to evaluate whether it is worth doing another type of business

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
or maybe it is worth investing money in another type of business

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
if the profitability of the capital is higher there.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Therefore, we say that the attitude of net profit to one's own capital

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
is the most important indicator of profitability that interests the businessman.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
And the indicator of net profit is the most important indicator that characterizes the profit.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
As we have already said, net profit is the profit that remains at the enterprise.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
There is also profitability of investments.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
An enterprise can invest money in its development.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
It is wonderful to invest, to develop.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
But any businessman is interested in how effective it is to invest money in a particular project.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Is it worth creating a new workshop, mastering the production of new products?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Is it worth studying something new, inventing something new,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
investing huge amounts of money? What will it bring?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
This is exactly what shows the profitability of investments.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
The attitude of net profit to investments.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
This is an interesting indicator that characterizes modern business.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
That is why when we talk about the analysis of financial results,

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
we will first talk about how the net profit changes and how profitability changes.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
What influences these indicators?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Here we need to make a small reservation.

10:51.000 --> 11:03.000
Unfortunately, we live in a real business where reality and the theory that comes from science do not always coincide.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
When we say that profit is the goal of capitalistic production,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
it reflects that the higher the profit and the higher the profitability, the more effectively the enterprise works.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
This is the absolute truth.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
And this is where the following would come from.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Every businessman should strive to build his enterprise in such a way that he earns as much as possible.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And be proud that the profit at his enterprise is the highest,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
that the profitability of this business is the highest.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
This is the main task of a businessman, which he should be proud of.

11:48.000 --> 11:59.000
But the fact is that in addition to earning profit, there is also taxation.

12:00.000 --> 12:11.000
Any state takes taxes for the simple reason that the state has expenses that it must pay in order for the country to function normally.

12:12.000 --> 12:21.000
But the financial structure of the state always decides what taxes to take and how much.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
In different countries, taxes are different.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And the tax burden in different countries is different.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And the tax structure in different countries is different.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
And this tax structure leads to the fact that some taxes are heavier in one country and lighter in another.

12:39.000 --> 12:51.000
Such a tax, which is very important from the tax burden and from the point of view of the business, is the tax on profit.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
If the tax on profit is excessive from the point of view of the business,

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
then the enterprise strives to minimize the profit it shows,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
or even minimize the profit it earns.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
In order to pay a smaller tax.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
We see a contradiction here.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
On the one hand, the development of a business requires as much profit as possible.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
And on the other hand, the minimization of the tax burden requires as little profit as possible.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And in general, to have as little profit as possible.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
But the reason for this contradiction is excessive tax burden in the area of profit.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.000
If the taxes are not excessive, then any businessman does not pay attention to this tax.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
He considers it normal, natural.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And he does not minimize the indicator to which this tax is applied.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
This has long been noticed in all capitalist countries.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
And there are many capitalist countries where the tax on profit is reduced to its minimum.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
For example, in New Zealand and in countries that impose similar tax burden, there is also a tax on profit.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
However, if an enterprise invests in its own business

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
with a sum no less than the tax on profit, then it is exempted from paying this tax.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Pay attention.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
In this case, any businessman is interested in showing the maximum profit.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And this profit is invested in the development of his own business.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
And no one hides, even a penny, a penny, no one will hide the profit from tax deductions.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
In these countries, the tax on profit is not fiscal, but stimulating.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
Because the tax on profit does not contradict the main goal of capitalist production,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
which is to earn maximum profit.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
In our country, unfortunately, this is not the case.

15:07.000 --> 15:16.000
In our country, the tax on profit brings a lion's share of taxes to the state budget.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
This tax pays the main attention of our tax authorities.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
It is clear that if this tax is the main attraction,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
then the business is also attracted to this tax with increased attention,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
with increased caution, and does not strive to show its profit excessively.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And does not strive to get the maximum profit.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
This is the worst.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
One thing is when a business does not strive to show its profit, but strives to create it.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And another thing is when it does not strive to create it at all.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
This is the worst.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
After all, without creating profit, the enterprise is not interested in increasing the productivity of labor,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
reducing its cost.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Why? To pay more taxes?

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Hence the slowdown of the country's economic development.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Taxation on profit is a very sharp tool.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
If we want to have a high rate of economic development,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
we must have a generous tax on profit.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
We just need to transfer the burden of taxation to other taxes,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
other taxes that are less sensitive to business.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
In this case, business will be interested in the tax.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
In this case, business will be interested in increasing the productivity of labor,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
increasing the volume of production at the most possible rates.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
In addition to the fact that the enterprise shows the profit it earns,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
other factors that we will discuss now affect the amount of profit.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
The fact is that each of us has a different role.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
We are all in the same boat.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
The fact is that each enterprise has its own accounting policy.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
It chooses this policy for the current year and carries it out.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
The current accounting policy can change the amount of profit received during the year.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
there is a very important difference between the current accounting policy

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and the current accounting policy.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
the current accounting policy can change the amount of profit received during the year.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
The current accounting policy can change the amount of profit received during the year.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Yes, you are absolutely right.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
But only under two conditions.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
If there is no inflation,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
and all the products are not produced,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
then any of the accounting policy options

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
ultimately give the same amount of profit.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
And the amount will not change just by rearranging the places of the deposits.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
But there is inflation, which leads to devaluation of money.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
And there is an unproduced product, which may not be produced.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
This leads to the fact that the amount of profit does not match.

18:27.000 --> 18:35.000
How does the accounting policy affect the amount of profit received?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Here we can highlight the following cases.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
The first is the method of amortization of property.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
The Ministry of Finance gives the enterprise the right to choose

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
the method by which the amortization of the main funds is carried out.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
These methods are specified in the Tax Code.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
The method is linear or non-linear.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Using different methods,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
you can get different amounts of amortization.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
And the greater the amortization, the greater the value of the product,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
the less the amount of profit that the enterprise receives,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
and therefore the less tax that can be obtained from this profit.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
And here, again, the interests of the state and business are contradicted.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
In the modern tax system, as we have already said,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
the business is interested in showing as little profit as possible.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And the state, and absolutely reasonably, absolutely legally,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
strives to collect as much tax as possible,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
because the state has expenses that it must bear.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.000
The tax authorities strive to collect as much tax as possible.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Moreover, this tax is the most important among all taxes today.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
This is where the contradiction arises.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
The Ministry of Finance allowed the use of different amortization methods.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
But the tax authorities prefer only one linear method of amortization.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
The enterprise is between two fires.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
But if the tax authorities adopt only the linear method of amortization,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
all enterprises are forced to build their accounting policy

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
based on the linear method of amortization.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
The rest of the methods are just optional,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
and can be used, but cannot be shown to anyone.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Absolutely, it is not used.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Here we see a contradiction between the structures,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
which are essentially one and the same,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
since the Ministry of Taxation is the main part

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
and is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
But here the right hand and the left hand do different things.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The Ministry of Finance allows,

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
while the tax authorities prefer and adopt only one amortization method.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
In fact, the amortization of property is a very interesting issue.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It is deeply developed scientifically.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Scientists have argued and concluded

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
that the cost of property is reduced non-linearly.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Most often it is not linear.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
The cost is lost in the first period of the existence of the product.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
If you have a car,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
as soon as it leaves the car dealership,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
it is instantly lost in price.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
If you try to sell it to someone,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
even without a single kilometer of mileage,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
the price of the car will be lower.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
We see a sharp reduction in the price of any product.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
The same is true of all other equipment used in production.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
First, there is a sharp reduction in the price,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
then a slowdown.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
But in practice, a linear, uniform method of amortizing the product

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
is used to transfer it to its cost.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It is that simple for the tax authorities.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
The second method that enterprises can use

22:53.000 --> 23:03.000
and which also affects the amount of profit is the method of evaluating production reserves.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
As we have already said, any enterprise has reserves

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
that it uses to maintain the rhythm.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
These reserves are periodically replenished.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
There is a huge amount of goods purchased at different prices

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
of the same raw material.

23:30.000 --> 23:39.000
All this is piled up, loaded, and then used by the enterprise.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
What are the costs?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
At what price are these reserves taken into account?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
There are several options.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
The following methods are allowed to be used.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
At the initial price, at which price was it bought,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
at that price it was written off.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
The first purchased, the first written off.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
The opposite is possible.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
The last purchased, the first written off.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
At the price at which the last reserve was bought,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
at that price it was written off.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
There is an option of the average,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
when the cost is determined as the average

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
for all purchased raw materials.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
For short-term goods that have a shelf life,

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
that cannot be stored for a long time,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
for example, food, medicine,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
there are party methods.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
The word party, where a specific batch of goods is taken into account

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
when it was purchased, at what price.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
This is taken into account.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
For the enterprise itself, the various methods it uses

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
allow it to get both more and less profit.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
If the costs of the goods purchased earlier

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
were used, then due to inflation

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
their prices were significantly lower

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
than the prices at which the goods are now being purchased.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
Therefore, if we take into account the cost of the goods purchased earlier,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
we will get the biggest profit.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
This method is used when the enterprise needs to show profit.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
And probably all enterprises would use this method

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
if they were not restrained by taxation.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
The next point that affects the amount of profit

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
is the method of determining profit from the implementation.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
The thing is, what should be considered

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
as the moment of the production implementation?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
There are several possible options that are found in practice.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
The first one is the moment of the production implementation

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
and can be considered as the unloading of the goods.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
Yes, the goods were unloaded, but the money for it was not received yet.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
The second option is the payment, when the money for the goods was received.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
At first glance, it seems that these options have nothing to do with the amount of profit.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
And what is the difference?

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
The fact is that if you need to pay a tax,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
you need to have the means to pay it.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
In this case, if we consider the profit from the payment,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
we have the means to pay the tax.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
We have already received this money,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
then we can pay the tax properly.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
If we consider the fact of the implementation of the unloading,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
the payment is not yet received,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
but you have unloaded the goods to the credit,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and provided the goods for the trade.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
And the payment is delayed.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Sometimes the payment is delayed for a long time,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
and you need to pay the tax now.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
With what money?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
You did not receive the money.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
In this seemingly simple question,

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
the logical answer is that the payment method should be considered

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
at the time of the transaction,

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
which is required with the subsequent payment of taxes.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
But here our reality interferes.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
As soon as the payment method is applied,

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
it is possible to have a case that occurs in a non-profit business,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
where the goods are unloaded,

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
the money is not officially received,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
but the official payment is not.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
Yes, there was a debt of two, three, ten years.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
No one returned the money, because it was already paid.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Unofficially.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
And in this case, there is no possibility of completing the transaction,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
and therefore there is no possibility to pay the tax.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And if the payment method is considered,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
then not all, but some non-profit enterprises

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
will immediately stop paying the tax at all.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
They will say, we did not receive the money,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
no one paid us,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and therefore we do not pay any taxes.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
The tax service will receive a huge deficit in the tax on the profit.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
And on the other hand, if we take the unloading method,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
then we get the opposite situation.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Enterprises have problems.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
They do not have money, but they need to pay taxes.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
But there is no money.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Then they have to increase their creditorial debt,

29:07.000 --> 29:17.000
to pay the taxes on which they have not yet received their money.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
If we turn to the international standards of financial accountability,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
then we will notice the following.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
That the moment of the transaction is considered

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
the transfer of documents to the legal one.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
That is, when documents are transferred from one enterprise to another.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The transaction has been made,

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
and this is the moment when taxes should be paid.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Choosing one form of accounting policy,

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
the enterprise decides how much profit it needs at the moment.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Does it need more profit now?

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Or it can postpone the profit for a later period,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
by saving it from the impact of inflation.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
In fact, the profit for the enterprise is very important.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
The fact is that the entire social sphere of the enterprise

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
can be maintained only by profit.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
If we remember the period 20 years ago,

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
almost every large enterprise contained a social sphere.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
These were dormitories, clinics, cultural centers,

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
children's pioneer camps, kindergartens, sanatoriums.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
All this was necessary for each enterprise,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
because it allowed it to attract the workforce

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
that was necessary for the performance of certain tasks.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
But as soon as the enterprise began to have a profit,

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
the entire social sphere became instantly uninvited.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
The enterprise has nothing to keep all the objects listed above.

31:19.000 --> 31:27.000
There is no profit, so it is impossible to allocate funds for their maintenance.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
All over the country, there are abandoned kindergartens,

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
pioneer camps, where the wind blows more often than children.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Many objects have switched to self-sufficiency,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
they began to earn money on their own.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
But they have ceased to be social objects of the enterprise.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
Today, very few enterprises boast that they have social objects.

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
They are necessary for the employees of this enterprise.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Is it good that, for example,

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
women have to register at this kindergarten before the birth of a child

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
in order to get a place in a kindergarten?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
This is not normal.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
The social sphere in society must be and must be financed.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
For this enterprise, there must be a profit.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
The tax on profit should not be so strong

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
to completely overshadow the entire social policy in the country.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
We will assume that the enterprise is making a profit,

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
that it does not completely refuse it and is thinking about its receipt.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
And we, as financiers, who are designed to provide financial registration

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
and the proper execution of the profit,

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
must make sure that the enterprise receives as much profit as possible.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
In addition to the accounting policy,

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
a number of other factors depend on the amount of profit.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
First of all, the volume of goods and services produced.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
It is clear that the more goods and services are produced,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
the more opportunities are available to make a profit.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
In addition to the total volume, the structure of the produced product also affects.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
In fact, among the produced products there are more or less quality,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
more expensive or less expensive,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
which bring more profit or less profit,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
which are more profitable or less profitable,

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
and the structure of the enterprise can increase the total amount of profit.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
The price level is not the last place.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
By regulating the prices of their products,

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
in the aspect in which the enterprise can do it on its own,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
you can achieve an increase in profit.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
And, of course, the most important point is self-worth.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
Self-worth is in the opposite proportional dependence

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
on the profit that the enterprise receives.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
That is, with the same revenue,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the lower the self-worth, the more profit.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
Therefore, if each enterprise is interested in maximizing its profits,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
it is primarily interested in reducing its self-worth.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
If profit becomes the goal of the enterprise,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
as an expression of its efficiency,

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
increasing productivity becomes the main way to increase profits.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
If self-worth is definitely influenced by profit,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
in the sense that the lower the self-worth, the more profit,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
then the above three factors,

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
such as the volume of the implementation of the structure and the price level,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
are not unambiguous.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
In this respect, the influence on profit is the most important.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
The thing is that it is necessary to take into account

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the elasticity of the product.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
This is the most important point that a businessman needs to know,

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
in order to properly implement his product.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Every product has elasticity.

35:39.000 --> 35:46.000
Elasticity is the reaction of the product to the change in price.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
How will the demand for a given product change with the change in price?

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Elasticity is generally determined by the ratio of the increase in demand to the increase in price.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
It is clear that if the price increases, the demand decreases.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Elasticity is always negative.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
But the increase in price and the increase in demand

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
can be in different quantities.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
The demand can decrease faster than the increase in price,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
it can decrease slower than the increase in price,

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
or it can decrease to the same degree as the price changes.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Three levels of elasticity are determined.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
They say that the demand for non-elastic products

36:38.000 --> 36:43.000
decreases extremely slowly compared to the change in price.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
The most non-elastic product is the salt from the kitchen.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You come to a store and see how much salt is in the kitchen.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
You see that a kilogram of salt costs 13 rubles.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Tell me, please, if there is salt for 14 rubles,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
will people buy it less or more?

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
The price is the same, but 15 rubles is the same,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
and 20 rubles is the same.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
We see that salt, despite the increase in its price,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
the demand for it does not change.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
This means that salt is an absolutely non-elastic product.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
With the help of salt, you can get additional profit.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
It's not a coincidence that in the old days,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Russia had a state monopoly on salt.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
And only the state had the right to sell salt.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
However, this led to excessive increases in the price of salt,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
and it caused salt riots, history remembers it.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Nevertheless, salt is such a non-elastic product

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
that it can bring very high income to those who make it.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
The reason is that salt is very much needed by people.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
It cannot be replaced by anything.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Salt cannot be replaced with sugar, milk, bread.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Salt cannot be replaced by anything.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
It is very much needed.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
It is needed in small quantities.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
Moreover, the price of salt is so low

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
that people's purchasing power

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
is so low that they are easily swayed by the price of salt.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
The other opposite is the case of elastic products,

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
where the smallest change in price can cause a huge drop in demand.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
This happens with products that have a lot of substitutes.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
A typical example is clothes.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Clothes have so many substitutes

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
that the buyer is ready to switch to any other type of clothing

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
if the one he planned to buy seems too expensive to him.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Therefore, clothes have a very high elasticity.

39:14.000 --> 39:21.000
The smallest increase in price can cause a huge drop in demand

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
for elastic products.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
There are products with so-called single elasticity,

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
where the price and demand changes are very much in the quantitative sense.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
The higher the price, the lower the demand.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
As a result, neither increase nor decrease in price

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
bring any additional profit.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Knowing what product you are producing

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
is the first task of a businessman.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
And that is why.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
The thing is that in order to get additional profit from the product,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
you need to pay attention to its elasticity.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
For non-elastic products,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
look at salt,

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
for non-elastic products,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
look at salt.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
In order to get additional profit,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
you need to raise the price.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
The price increases,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
the cost remains the same,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
and the profit increases sharply.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
And for elastic products,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
in order to increase the profit,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
you need to lower the price.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Pay attention,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
for non-elastic products,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
you need to raise the price,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
and for elastic products,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
you need to lower the price a little bit.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And the demand for this product increases sharply.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Where does it come from?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
It's the former buyers of other products

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
who were ready to buy other products earlier.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
But since only your product became cheaper,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
and not other products,

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
they instantly switched to your product.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
The demand has increased sharply.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
You can sell tens, hundreds, thousands of times more products,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
lowering the price by a penny.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Your profit from a single product decreases,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
but the mass of profit you get

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
increases sharply,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
because you manage to sell a huge amount of products.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
But this method of lowering the price for elastic products

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
can be used only if you are able to provide

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
a larger number of products for the market.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
If you have a production,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
and you can increase the production,

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
for example, from one shift to two,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
from two to three,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
or you have unlimited supplies,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and you can order more and more products,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
then you can safely go for a price reduction

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
for elastic products,

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
sell more products,

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
and get more profit.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
This is a very important point.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
And every businessman,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
before using the price and production volume

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
to regulate his profit,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
should first think about

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
the elasticity of the product he sells.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
But elasticity not only depends on nature.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Elasticity of the product depends on

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
the environment of the product and other products.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
If there are no competitors,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
substitutes,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
then your product increases its non-elasticity.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
And the same clothes,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
which would seem to be the most elastic product,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
if for some reason

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
all competitors disappear,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
and you become the only seller of clothes,

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
your product becomes non-elastic.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
And vice versa.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
If there are more and more competitors,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
and these competitors themselves reduce the price,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
then your product becomes more and more elastic,

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
and all buyers leave you.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
And you can no longer produce your products.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Thus, the environment

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
affects the elasticity of your product.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Knowing this,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
a businessman takes care not only of

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
selling less elastic products,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
but also of creating an environment

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
where the elasticity of the product decreases.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
For example, in the trading network you can see

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
products that are sold

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
under the trademark of a given trading network.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And under this pretext,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
the company limits the purchase

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
of similar products from other manufacturers,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
and only sells its own products

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
under the brand of its trading network.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
And thus, in the trading network,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
there is only one salt,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
one single sugar.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
In the eyes of the buyer,

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
the competition disappears.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The elasticity of this product increases.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
The higher the elasticity of this product,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
the more you can boldly increase the price of the business,

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
and make additional profit

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
when selling such a product.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Thus, we see

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
that the volume of implementation

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
and the price level of the product

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
do not necessarily affect the profit,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
but through the elasticity of this product.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
It is important to pay attention

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
to the elasticity of the product

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
and to manage it.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
For example,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
oligopolies very often

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
enter into a contract

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
and agree to sell the product

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
under the same conditions.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Thus, the competition between them disappears.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Let's say we have three manufacturers

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
who produce the same product.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
When they entered into a contract,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
they competed.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Each tried to sell more of his product,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
and consequently reduced the price,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
which forced others to reduce the price.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
As a result, even the most unelastic product, salt,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
is sold at a very low price.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
But if the manufacturers enter into a contract

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
and agree that they will sell,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
for example, at the same price,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
all salt manufacturers,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
and suddenly decide that it is more profitable for them

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
to sell at the same price,

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
and not to agree with each other,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
the price of salt will go higher and higher.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
There is no competition.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Salt is the most unelastic product,

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
and the price increase

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
brings additional profit to each manufacturer.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
And the buyer has nowhere to turn.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
There is no other product

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
that is sold cheaper.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
The price is the same for all of them.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
There are three forms of conspiracy

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
that can be found among the oligopolists.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
The first is the sale at a single price.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
The second is the market share.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Each of the oligopolists gets his territory,

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
and only on this territory

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
does he sell his product.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
There are no other competitors.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
He sells his product,

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
acting as a monopolist on this territory,

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
and consequently selling it

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
at a monopoly high price.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
This is the same as when

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
the trading networks sell at their own price.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
They have made their own territory,

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
their own trading network,

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
a monopoly for themselves.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
They don't let any competitors in.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
And within this trading network,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
they sell their product

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
at a monopoly high price.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
The oligopolist remains.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
And the third form of conspiracy

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
is the purchase at a single price.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Despite the fact that

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
we are dealing with oligopolists,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
they don't produce any product themselves,

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
they buy some raw materials,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
some semi-finished products,

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
some accessories,

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
so that they can make products from them.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
They can agree

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
that they will set

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
a single purchase price.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
But this is only the first step.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
As soon as they agree

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
that they have set a single purchase price,

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
they take the second step.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
They agree that they will reduce

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
this purchase price.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
And those who do not agree

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
with this agreement,

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
those who sell them products,

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
have nowhere to go.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
No matter where they go,

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
everyone has the same low price.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
And the price is getting lower and lower.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Thus, the oligopolists

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
get additional profit.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
When we talk about oligopolists

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
and that they can get

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
additional profit

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
by entering into a conspiracy,

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
we must realize

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
that these actions of oligopolists

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
are punishable,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
criminalized

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
in all countries of the world.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Conspiracy is considered

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
an unfair business

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
because it gets

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
additional profit

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
without making any effort

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
to improve

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
the product

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
and services

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
that the consumer

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
gets.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
In all countries of the world

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
in case of discovery of a conspiracy,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
those who enter into it

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
bear a certain responsibility.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
But this does not make

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
the world less of a conspiracy.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Those who enter into a conspiracy,

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
those who agree

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
to run a business

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
of a conspired one,

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
do it more carefully,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
more carefully.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
And this is a very important

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
and important thing.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
And this is a very important thing.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
For example,

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
examples from our reality

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
that can tell us

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
that a conspiracy exists

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
around us.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
If suddenly

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
in Moscow,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
at the same time

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
at all gas stations

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
the price of gasoline

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
increases by the same amount

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
on the same day.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
What does this mean?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
It means that

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
the gas station

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
or its owners

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
could have agreed

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
at what price

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
they would sell their gasoline

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
starting from this day

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
and this hour.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
This is an element of conspiracy.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Because imagine

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
that if it was not so

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
and only one of them

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
decided that he would

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
increase the price of gasoline

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
sharply,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
and all the others

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
would not do it.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
And he was forced

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
to return the price

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
to the same level

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
it was.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
A separately taken manufacturer

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
cannot increase the price

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
and secure itself

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
at this price level

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
without improving

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
the quality of the product

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
or the services

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
with which the product is sold.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
And conspiracies can.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
And what should the car lovers

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
do?

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
All gas stations

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
sell gasoline

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
at the same price.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
They are forced to buy.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
But it is very difficult

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
to prove that there was a conspiracy.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
The fact of increasing the price

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
is not a fact

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
of a conspiracy.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
It is only

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
a hypothesis

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
to what it is.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yes, it is a hypothesis

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
without a basis

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
of a proven fact.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
If we manage to get a document

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
with the signatures of all the owners

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
where it is written

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
that they agreed

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
with such a day,

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
with such a time

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
with such a new price

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
it is proof of the existence of a conspiracy.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
And then such proof

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
is the basis

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
for criminal prosecution.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
There is no document

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
and no proof.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Even with a hypothetical assumption

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
that there is a conspiracy.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Oligopolists very often

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
use the element of conspiracy.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
The thing is

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
that in order to become an oligopolist

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
it is necessary

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
to have very few

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
such business units.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Two, three, five

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
for the whole industry.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Two or three enterprises

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
for the whole industry

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
that control the whole industry.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
It is easy

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
to enter into a conspiracy with each other.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
They know each other

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
and they know each other very well.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
But here they have two possible behavior options.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
They can compete

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
very much with each other.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
And since there are not many such enterprises

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
in the whole industry

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
if they are very large

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
and very rich

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
then the competition

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
can take the most tough forms.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
First of all, by reducing the price.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
When such enterprises compete

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
with each other

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
they start reducing the price

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
to lure the buyers to their side.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
And the price collapse begins.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
One company

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
is ahead of the other

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
and the other one catches up with it

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
reducing the price.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
In the 90s

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
we had

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
an example of such competition

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
between mobile operators.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
There were several of them

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
all over Moscow.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
And they compete with each other

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
reducing

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
the price

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
almost every week

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
or every month.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
For the buyers

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
it was very good.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
We went down from the sky-high

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
services of telephone

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
to the acceptable

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
level of payment

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
of telephone services.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
But then,

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
starting from some point

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
mobile operators

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
started to compete

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
with each other

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
by the price factor.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
And vice versa.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
If you ask a consumer

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
from the point of view

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
of the consumer

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
which mobile operator is better

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
everyone answers

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
that they are about the same.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
They reached parity

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
when they stopped competing

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
with the price.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Why did it happen?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Did they agree

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
that during the competition

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
they can destroy each other

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
or even destroy everyone

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
and no company

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
of such level

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
will remain?

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
The reason is

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
that sooner or later

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
the company will take its place

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
and the company will stop

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
competing with the price

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
and will continue to run

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
a normal business

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
but the price level will decrease.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Did it happen

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
and did the prices stop?

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
It's hard to say

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
but the prices stopped

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
and the competition

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
stopped.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
There is another example

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
more obvious

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
with evidence.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
There is a government

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
and a budget

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Russian-Belarusian budget

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
and the money is allocated

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
for business support.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
There was a program

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
called

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Union TV

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
and in this program

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
it was written

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
which TV factories

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
in Belarus

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
and Russia

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
in which regions

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
should sell

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
their products

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
and it was signed

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
by the main figures

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
of the government

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
and this is

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
one of the forums

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
of the agreement

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
on the territory of sales.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Each factory

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
has its own territory

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
where only it can

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
sell its products.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
We see that even at the interstate level

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
there are cases

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
of collusion

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
which can only be qualified

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
and which allows to divide

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
the sales region

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
and sell the products.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Yes, it was necessary

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
to support the domestic manufacturers

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Belarusian and Russian

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
with foreign TV manufacturers.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
But according to the forum

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
we had a place

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
in the officially signed

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
agreement.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Let's move on

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
to the next question

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
and say that

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
besides

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
the profit from the agreement

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
which monopolists have

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
they can get

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
profit

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
by reducing

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
their cost.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Getting profit

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
by reducing their cost

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
is probably

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
the most decent

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
and the most decent

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
way to get profit

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
from the point of view of the consumer.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Because it is a way

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
to increase the productivity of the labor.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Reducing their cost

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
and consequently reducing the prices

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
is a way

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
of scientific and technical progress.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
It is always a positive

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
and a phenomenon

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
which is welcomed

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
all over the world.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
I think

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
that the time is not far

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
when we in our country

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
will raise

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
the policy

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
of increasing

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
the productivity

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
of the labor

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
on the account

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
of the economic policy.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
And when we will not only

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
increase the cost

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
of the domestic product

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
which is an important point

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
but also increase

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
the productivity

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
of the labor.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Reducing the cost

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
and consequently reducing the prices

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
should be done.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
We all know

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
that the imported goods

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
are always characterized

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
by the same dependence

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
on the price.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
The price is increasing,

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
decreasing, decreasing.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Remember the computer.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Remember any processor

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
that is connected to this computer.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
As soon as a new processor appears

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
it appears at a very high price.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
But a very short period of time

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
passes and the price of this processor

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
decreases.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Why?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Because the productivity of the labor

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
increases.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
The marriage decreases.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
The output of the product increases.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
You can give examples

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
of Russian business

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
where the price was high

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
and then it decreased

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
right in front of your eyes.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
This policy is not accepted

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
in our country.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
We do not have

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
a custom

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
that every product

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
loses its price

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
as it is produced.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Most likely we have a different direction.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Due to inflation

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
the price of a product

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
will increase slowly.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Therefore, the transition

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
to the policy of increasing

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
productivity and decreasing

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
cost is a major direction

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
for any country,

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
including, or maybe in the first place,

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
for our country.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
But here,

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
to explain why

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
one country is predisposed

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
to increase the productivity

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
and the other is not,

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
we need to answer

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
to the following question.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
I will draw a picture

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
where you will answer

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
why some countries

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
increase the productivity

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
and others do not.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Imagine two countries

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
that produce

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
the same product

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
in both countries.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
But in one country

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
the level of salary

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
of all employees

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
is very low,

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
well, at least

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
below the minimum wage.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
And in the other country

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
the level of salary

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
is very high.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
The standard of living is very high.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
And they produce the same product.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
The question is

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
which of these countries

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
is interested

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
in increasing

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
the productivity

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
of the work

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
in the country.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
And should we reduce

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
the cost of living?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Where is the minimum cost

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
or where is the highest

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
in the same product?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The answer is obvious.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Where is the highest

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
standard of living

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
the business is more interested

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
in increasing

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
the productivity of the work.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
To introduce new technology,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
to conduct scientific research

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
to extract this product

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
from the market

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
is a great profit.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And where the standard of living

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
is very low

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
there is no need

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
to introduce new technology.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Why?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
There is nothing

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
to save.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Therefore, the productivity of the work

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
is always increasing

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
at a higher pace

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
in the country

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
where the standard of living is high.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
This is a very important point.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The higher the standard of living

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
the higher the productivity of the work

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
in our country.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And we should not forget

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
about this.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Our businessmen

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
who, in fact,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
determine the level of salary

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
of all the citizens of our country.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
By saving on salary

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
we stop

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
the scientific and technical progress.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
We stop it completely.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Forever.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The cost of living is a very important point.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
To reduce the cost of living

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
should be the goal

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
of any business.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And, among other things,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
the goal of the country's economic policy.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
A very important point

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
is to create conditions

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
in which the business

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
benefits from reducing the cost of living.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
We have already discussed

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
that the cost of living

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
is the cost of production

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and sale of products

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
expressed in the form of money.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
In order to produce

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
a product

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
you have to pay

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
a considerable cost.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You have to build factories,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
buy equipment,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
hire workers,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
buy raw materials,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
create goods

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and services

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
that are needed.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
All this requires a cost.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And in the modern world

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
the cost is huge.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
In order to produce a product

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
you have to pay a considerable cost

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
and minimize the cost.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Minimizing the cost

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
is the goal

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
of any business.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
The lower the cost,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
the higher the profit.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
The cost of living

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
can also be considered

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
as the profit,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
as we have discussed today,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
in different ways.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
First of all,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
the simplest form of cost of living

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
is the cost of the product

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
that is produced.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
This is a small cost

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
because it only includes

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
the costs that are directly related

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
to the production of the product.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But the thing is

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
that this product is not produced

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
on an uninhabited island

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and the worker

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
who produces it

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
is not in a vacuum.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He works in a certain workshop

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and in this workshop

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
there is not only

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
the cost of the production

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
of the product

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
but also the total production costs

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
that are related

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
to the maintenance of the workshop.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
There is a head of the workshop

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
with his salary,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
there is a warehouse,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
there is an ATK

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
that checks the quality,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
the technical control department,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
there is a technical staff

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
that cleans the workshop.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
All this requires additional costs.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Of course,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
they are not related to the production of the product,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
but without these costs

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
there will be no production.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Therefore, these costs

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
are also related to the cost of the workshop.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
As a result,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
we get the cost of the workshop

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
taking into account the costs

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
that are related to the workshop.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But the workshop

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
does not exist

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
by itself.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
The workshop

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
is a component unit

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
of the whole factory.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
There are many workshops

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
but besides the workshops

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
there are also

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
the services

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
that are common for the whole factory.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
There is an administrative and management staff,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
there is a design bureau,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
there is a material and technical supply department,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
there are transport services,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
there is a security guard

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
of this factory,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
there are security equipment services.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
These are all services

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
that are common for the whole factory,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
which are also

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
naturally

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
costly.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And without these services

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
our factory

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
cannot exist.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Imagine,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
there is no service of material and technical supply.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
What will our factory produce?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
There are no people who buy

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
or there is no department that implements this product.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
All of them are needed.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Although they are not directly related

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
to the production process of this product.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But they are related

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
to the production process

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
of this product.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Their costs

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
are also related

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
to the cost of production.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
As a result, we get

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
the production cost.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But the production cost

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
is reflected only by the production.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
There are also expenses for sales,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
for promotion of this product.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
For example,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
some of the product is given to the goods loan

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
with the payment deadline.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Do certain costs are needed for this?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Yes, they are.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
They also have certain costs.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Therefore, the expenses for sales

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
are also related to the cost of production.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And all together,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
when all these expenses are accumulated,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
we get the full cost of production.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Moreover, the operational cost

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
of the creation of the product

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
can sometimes take a very modest part.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Therefore, when we talk about

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
the reduction of the cost of production,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
we are not only talking about

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
how to increase the productivity of the work

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
in the production process itself,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
but also how to increase the productivity

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
of all the services

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
that are at the enterprise.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
The story in the languages

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
of the comparison of the domestic enterprises

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
with the foreign enterprises

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
in terms of the number of

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
service personnel.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
In our country,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
an import plant is being bought,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
it is being launched,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and the same plant

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
is operating in another country.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And the same factory

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
is operating in another country.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And as soon as it starts operating,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
it turns out that the number of employees

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
who work at the factory

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
in our country

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and the number of employees

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
who work at the same factory

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
in another country

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
are significantly different.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
That is, we have more people

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
working at the enterprise,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and therefore the expenses

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
that relate to the cost of production

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
will be significantly higher.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
This is no longer the achievement

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
of the last few days,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
but the fact that there are factories

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
that produce goods

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
that produce products

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
without the participation of people.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
The number of people is minimized.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Why? Because the salary is high.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
The salary is high,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
so the economy in the live labor

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
is the goal of the business.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
New technology is being introduced,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
robots are being installed.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The general knowledge of the world

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
is that the economy

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
is being developed.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
For example,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
the assembly of TVs

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
is being carried out

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
at such automata factories

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
without the participation of people.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
In Japan,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
the assembly of cars

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
is being carried out

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
without the participation of people.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
The car assembly shop

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
does not even turn on the light.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
There is absolute darkness.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Not a single worker.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And then the conveyor belt

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
is being assembled.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And the car is ready to go.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
There is a struggle

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
for the reduction of self-worth.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Not only of the production,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
but of all levels of self-worth

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
that participate

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and influence

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the full self-worth of the product.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I think that for our country

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
this is the task

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
of the near future.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
When we understand

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
that the reduction of self-worth

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
is the main path of development.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Because until we realize it,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
science in our country

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
will not develop.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Neither the technical science,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
nor the applied science

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
as it is being developed in the West.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It is not developing

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
because there are very smart people

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
who want to develop it.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yes, there are a lot of

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
talented people

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
who want to develop it.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But the science

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
is not developing

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
because of their self-worth.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
The business itself

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
makes them develop it.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Otherwise, you will not survive.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Our self-worth,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
the business itself

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
makes us forget about science.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Because this is how you can live.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And the consequence

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
is the high level of science

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
in some countries

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and the far-reaching level

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
of science in our country.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
For capitalism,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
the development of scientific and technical progress

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
is impossible.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And the rapid development

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
of scientific and technical progress

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
without the applied science

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
is impossible.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But it should be

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
the goal of any business.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Any businessman

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
should sleep and think

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
that he needs to introduce science

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
because he needs to reduce his self-worth.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Otherwise, I will not survive.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Until he thinks so,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
science will not develop.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It will just start to

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
fountain science

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
all over the country.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And only the self-worth

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
of the product affects it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The high level of self-worth

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
which should be reduced,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
reduced and reduced.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And in self-worth,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
as we know,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
the important component

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
is the salary.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
The higher the standard of living

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
of the population,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
the faster science will develop

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
because the higher the standard of living,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
the higher the productivity of labor.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The higher the productivity of labor,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
the higher the quality of the product

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
will be.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Therefore,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
the attention to self-worth,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
to its reduction

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
is the most important point

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
of our near future.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
As soon as we solve

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
the problem of inflation.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Today, inflation in the country

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
is more important

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
than the scientific and technical progress.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It eats everything.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It does not leave the means

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
for the development of science.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Even if a businessman

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
thinks about the development of science,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
he has no means for this science.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
He must invest it

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
in something every day.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Otherwise, due to inflation,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
he will be left without money.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
But since the level of inflation

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
in our country is decreasing

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
every year,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and according to the forecasts

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
of the Ministry of Finance,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
it should drop to 3%

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
in the near future,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
which corresponds to the level

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
of the most developed countries in the world,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
then we will go to the same level

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
as they did

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
in the scientific and technical progress.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And what we talked about

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
in the lecture today

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
will be our daily practice,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
our daily work

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
on reducing self-worth

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and increasing productivity.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
In addition to reducing self-worth

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and increasing the volume of production

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
and increasing profits,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
it is very important

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
to imagine

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
the reserves

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
of the enterprises

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
according to these indicators.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
If the reserve

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
of the growth of productivity

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
and the reserve

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
of the growth of the volume of production

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and the reserve

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
of the reduction of the volume

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
of production

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and the reserve

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
of the reduction of self-worth

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and the reserve

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
of the increase of the quality

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
of production.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
If the reserve exists

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
for the achievement of this reserve,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
it is worth fighting,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
it is worth sending forces there.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The financiers solve this issue

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and this issue is included

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
in the program of our lecture today.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
The slide you see now

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
shows examples

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
of the reserve

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
of the growth of productivity.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
It is a reserve of profit.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yes, it is.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
We have already discussed

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
that if we are talking

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
about non-elastic goods,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
then it makes sense

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
to increase the volume of production

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
and at the same time

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
to reduce the price.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
If we are talking

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
about elastic goods,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
then we should be very careful

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
with increasing the volume of production.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
We should look at the possibility

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
of increasing the volume of production.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
If we have such an opportunity,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
if we have a limited amount

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
of products in our warehouse

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and we are told

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
that it is easy

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
to increase the volume of production

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
by 2-10 times,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
then we can consider

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
increasing the volume of production

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
as a reserve of profit.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
We reduce the price,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
the demand increases sharply

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
because our goods are elastic.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
We increase the reserve

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
of increasing the volume of production

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
and we increase the volume

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
of the produced goods in several times.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yes, the profit of a unit of production

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
decreases,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
but because the volume of production

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
increases sharply,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
the product of increasing

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
the volume of production

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
increases the profit

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
of a unit of production.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It is a serious reserve.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
We should take it seriously,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
calculate it taking into account

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
whether we can get additional profit

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
by increasing the volume of production.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
The second way is reducing

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
the cost of production.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I told you about it today.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
There is a direct way

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
to reduce the cost of production.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
There are no alternative options.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
By reducing the cost of production

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
we can increase the profit

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
because the profit,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
as you remember,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
is the difference between the revenue

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
and the cost of production.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
If we reduce the cost of production

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
we get more profit.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
You may ask

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
why we do not reduce

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
the cost of production so sharply.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Why do we go this way

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
in the last place?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Why do we think about it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
in the last place

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
despite the obviousness of this way?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
The answer is simple.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The fact is that every businessman

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
decides

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
the task

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
that is in front of him.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
To reduce the cost of production

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
we should make certain efforts.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
For example,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
we should update the equipment

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and install more advanced equipment.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Advanced equipment

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
means often imported equipment,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
expensive equipment.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
A businessman decides the task.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
If he buys this expensive equipment

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and installs it,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
how much will he save

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
on the salary

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
of the workers who get money?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
He will save nothing.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
He will save a penny.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Is it worth buying this equipment

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and increasing the cost of production

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
and reducing the cost of production?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Why?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
What if the purchased equipment

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
will lead to a significant reduction

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
because the salary is very high

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and the cost of production is very high?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Then this equipment

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
will be bought very quickly.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Then yes.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Then it makes sense to buy

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
new equipment and reduce the cost of production.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
But until you can pay

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
the smallest salary,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
which is simply impossible to pay,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
until you can buy

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
new equipment,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
there is no reason.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
There is another important point.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The thing is that

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
buying imported equipment

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and installing it in your own country

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
plays an important role

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
in the exchange rate

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
of national currencies.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
If the exchange rate of national currency

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
is low in a country

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
that imports equipment,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
then what is available in our country

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
will be very expensive.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
But our equipment park

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
is not updated 100%.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Why?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Because the equipment is expensive for us.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It is not expensive for them,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
it is available at every factory.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But it is expensive for us.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Our exchange rate is low.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
The closer our exchange rate

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
will be to a certain parity,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
to its average level,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
the stronger the currency will be.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
The cheaper the import will be.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And it will be easier

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
to buy new equipment

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
that we cannot produce in our country.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And vice versa.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
In a country

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
where national currency

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
is highly fortified,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
buying imported equipment

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
becomes very cheap.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
If in our country

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
there were no such problems,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
we would have a very good exchange rate.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
If in our country

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
the exchange rate

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
was not the same as it is today,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
when we have undervalued currency,

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
but it was overvalued,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
then all our factories

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
and enterprises would have updated

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
all their equipment.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
We would say

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
that we have no old equipment left.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
We have all the latest equipment.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Why? Because it is all very cheap abroad.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It is very cheap.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
You can buy it and update

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
all production.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
You see, the exchange rate

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
affects the use

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
of imported equipment

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
in our country.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
If the exchange rate is low,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
imported equipment is not used.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
The same goes for equipment

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
that is over 100 years old.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And it is still in factories,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
the machines produced in the 19th century.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Until now

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I have been to an aviation factory

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
where the press

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
was produced

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
in the 19th century.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It is a German press.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It works well,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
but it was produced in the 19th century.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
It is not in museums

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
any more.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It is all over the world.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But it works in our country.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Because it is expensive

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
to buy a similar press,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
a new, modern one,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
even for an aviation factory.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It is expensive.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The next point

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
that can increase

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
the profit

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
is to improve the quality of production.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
The quality of production

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
is also a controversial issue.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The quality of production

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
means to produce a product

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
that brings more profit

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
to the manufacturer,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
that meets the needs

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
of the buyers.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And this is a very important point.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
We do not consider

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
the conditions

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
when a product is produced

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
without a defect,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and then the same product

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
is produced without a defect.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
We have already left

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
the times

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
when the lion's share

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
of defective products

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
was produced.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Today, all the products

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
are of a proper quality.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
the proper quality

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
can be different.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
There is a high quality level,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
an expensive product

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
of a high quality level.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
There is also a quality,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
reliable, good,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
but lower quality level,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
even lower, even lower.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Each product has its own consumer.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
To improve the quality of the product

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
is necessary.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
This is a very important point.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
To avoid such a theorization,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
let's move on

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
to the practical language.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
There is AutoVaz,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
which produces Zhiguli.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
There are import factories

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
that produce cars.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
The difference between Zhiguli

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
and imported cars

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
is the difference in the quality of the car.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
To improve the quality of the car

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
means to produce our product,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
which meets

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
the best imported samples.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
This is what we are talking about

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
when we talk about improving the quality.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
A better quality car

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
is produced at a higher price,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
and it brings a higher profit

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
to its manufacturers.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
The desire to produce a quality car,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
as well as the desire to produce

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
a quality product,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
should be present,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
organically present

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
in any business.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Only then will it strive for it

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and try to produce

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
a better quality car.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Unfortunately,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
not all our enterprises

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
produce products

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
of the world's quality.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
There are different reasons

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
for this.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
We will not analyze all the reasons,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
but we will focus on some of them.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
The thing is that

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
one of the reasons

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
for the two-sided protection

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
from the state

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and the manufacturers

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
is the lack of

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
support from the state.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
On the one hand,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
if we do not support

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
the domestic manufacturer,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
we can lose it.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
We lost the AZLK plant.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
The Moskvich car

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
was a car

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
of the previous period.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
We did not support it,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
we lost it.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
If we can approach

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
any business

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
without supporting it,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
we will lose it.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
We can lose AvtoVAZ,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
we can lose our civil aviation.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Everything that is behind

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
the world's leading level

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
today,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
especially in the light

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
of the rapid changes

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
that will come

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
with the entry

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
of the World Trade Organization,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
support is necessary

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
in those industries

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
that we need.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
For example,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
our country without aviation

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
is not our country anymore.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
A huge country

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
where you can move

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
from one point of the country

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
to another point

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
only quickly with the help

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
of aviation,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
such a country should have

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
aviation.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
A small country

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
where you can move

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
from one end of the country

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
to another in half an hour

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
by car,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
such a country

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
can not exist.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It is not applicable

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
inside the country.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
For our country

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
it is a fundamental issue.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
We are talking about civil aviation,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
there is also military aviation

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
that certainly requires

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
good aviation

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
and the development

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
of the aviation industry.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Therefore,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
if we abandon aviation,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
we will lose it.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
If we abandon

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
a certain industry,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
it can stop

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
developing at all.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It just keeps

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and allocates

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
all the funds

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
it needs.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And instead of developing

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
in a competitive way

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
with the whole world,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
it starts to live its own life

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and the production

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
of this enterprise

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
becomes absolutely

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
impossible.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
To find the golden mean

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
where we will have

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
a great development

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
of a certain industry

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
and on the other hand

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
we will not lose it.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It is not a simple issue

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
because

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
the interests are intertwined here.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
On the one hand,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
the interests of the state

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and on the other hand

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
the interests of people

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
who work on these enterprises.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
In Togliatti

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
the vast majority of people

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
work on these enterprises.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
It is also a social problem.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But on the other hand,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
it is also impossible

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
to stop the development

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
of the cars we produce today.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
That is the problem

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
of quality improvement.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
It is not a simple problem

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
in our period of history

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
how to improve the quality.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
But for us,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
the main thing is

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
to create

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
economic conditions

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
for improving the quality of production.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Just by saying

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
that the quality of production

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
is good

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
you will not succeed.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
The best economic condition

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
for stimulating the quality improvement

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
is competition.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
If there is competition,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
the manufacturer

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
is interested in improving the quality.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
If there is no competition,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
there is no quality

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
and there is no competition.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
There is no need to say.
