00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
In order to make an investment decision, we will need to familiarize ourselves with the four basic rules that are applied in this process

00:13.200 --> 00:19.600
The first rule is related to the pure given value, abbreviated as NPV

00:19.600 --> 00:24.800
Next, the Internal Revenue Rate, IRR

00:24.800 --> 00:28.600
Next, the profitability index and the period of purchase

00:29.200 --> 00:37.000
The last two parameters are familiar to us from the standard procedures of the economic analysis of the enterprise

00:37.000 --> 00:42.600
But they are used with an amendment to the discount

00:42.600 --> 00:52.800
The first two, NPV and IRR, are entirely and completely built on the model of assessing the value of a financial asset

00:53.400 --> 00:58.800
We will also consider a couple of points in this section, but more on that later

00:58.800 --> 01:17.200
So, the pure given value, abbreviated as NPV, is the difference between the discounted investments in the project and the discounted cash flows from the project

01:17.600 --> 01:32.400
Remember, when we work in the standard economy, when we operate with accounting, we take the expenses per nominal and the income per nominal, and find the difference

01:32.400 --> 01:40.800
In our case, we use the expenses and income in the same way, but only after the discount

01:41.400 --> 01:50.400
So, if you discount, returning to the example of determining your value

01:50.400 --> 02:03.400
If you discount all your expenses that you will have to make in the next year, and all your income that you will have to get in the next year

02:04.000 --> 02:16.200
You will get two numbers, then subtract the expenses from the income, you will get a difference, either positive or negative

02:16.200 --> 02:26.200
And this will be evidence that you have income for this year, or vice versa, you do not have it and you will fall into some debts to someone

02:27.000 --> 02:32.400
Returning to our slide, the rule of using NPV

02:32.400 --> 02:40.600
You can accept a project for execution, for financing, if the NPV is greater than zero

02:40.600 --> 02:47.000
You can, if you have several projects, accept a project for execution, whose NPV is the largest

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
These are simple rules

02:49.800 --> 02:58.600
But I would like to ask you a question, if the NPV project is zero, should you accept such a project for execution, if there are no others?

02:58.600 --> 03:04.000
There are situations when such a project can be accepted for execution, why?

03:04.000 --> 03:10.200
Because thanks to such a project, you can save your capital

03:11.200 --> 03:18.200
Your capital will not decrease, but it will not grow, it will remain at the previous level, and this is already an achievement

03:18.200 --> 03:22.200
You were able to save it over the past year, not lose it

03:22.200 --> 03:27.200
So in some cases, a project with a zero NPV can be accepted

03:27.200 --> 03:37.200
At the same time, I will draw your attention to the fact that a project with a zero NPV will certainly have an accounting profit

03:37.200 --> 03:40.200
Let's look at a more detailed example

03:40.200 --> 03:44.200
The next slide shows the calculations

03:44.200 --> 03:50.200
So, the investment in the project is 100 units

03:50.200 --> 03:57.200
Let's assume that these investments are made at once, at the current time, they do not need to be discounted

03:57.200 --> 04:02.200
At the current time, we do this to make the example easier

04:02.200 --> 04:14.200
The project is designed for 5 years, and its cash flows are 20, 20, 20, 30, and 30 units

04:14.200 --> 04:23.200
If we add them up by the nominal, we get a profit of 120 minus 100, the income is certainly higher than the expenses

04:23.200 --> 04:30.200
The discount rate is 10%, in other words, the market value of resources is 10%

04:31.200 --> 04:35.200
Then we substitute everything in the formula

04:35.200 --> 04:43.200
NPV, we take the investment in the project with a minus sign, because it is the cash flow

04:43.200 --> 04:49.200
Everything else we take with a plus sign, because it is the inflow of cash

04:49.200 --> 04:57.200
Please note that the discount rate is not in percents, but in dollars

04:57.200 --> 05:06.200
So, if we calculate by this formula, for example, a computer or Excel can do it very quickly

05:06.200 --> 05:12.200
Then we get that NPV is equal to, look, the second line

05:12.200 --> 05:19.200
20 units of income received in a year today cost us about 18

05:19.200 --> 05:26.200
20 units of income received in two years today cost us about 16

05:26.200 --> 05:38.200
Then 15 and income of 30 units per year we turn into today's 20 and 18

05:38.200 --> 05:45.200
If we add them all up, we get only 88, almost 89 units

05:45.200 --> 05:50.200
This is not enough to get to zero NPV

05:50.200 --> 05:53.200
We get a negative NPV

05:53.200 --> 06:04.200
In fact, if we take up the implementation of this project, and even if we successfully implement it, we will incur a financial loss of 11 units

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
This is an absolute value

06:06.200 --> 06:18.200
In the absence of other information, we can say that this project should be rejected

06:19.200 --> 06:25.200
The next rule is related to the so-called period of payback

06:25.200 --> 06:34.200
This is a period that is required to reimburse the investment, but taking into account the discounting procedure

06:34.200 --> 06:38.200
Let's look at an example, it is shown on the slide

06:38.200 --> 06:45.200
The same initial 100 units of investment, the same 5 years for which the project is designed

06:46.200 --> 06:56.200
If we take the already discounted cash flows, let them be equal to 25, 25, 25, 25 and 30

06:56.200 --> 07:00.200
4 times 25, the last year 30 units

07:00.200 --> 07:05.200
And check the NPV, yes, there are 30 units

07:05.200 --> 07:07.200
Now about the period of payback

07:07.200 --> 07:14.200
Our initial 100 units will pay off exactly in the first 4 years

07:14.200 --> 07:17.200
There is no formula, everything is quite obvious

07:17.200 --> 07:23.200
You add up the cash flows until the amount does not exceed the initial investment

07:23.200 --> 07:34.200
If our investment amount was not 100 units, but 110, what would be the period of payback?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.200
Now the answer

07:37.200 --> 07:45.200
In order to get the necessary amount of 110 units, we will have to wait 4 years

07:45.200 --> 07:50.200
25, 25, 25, 25, 100, and we need 110

07:50.200 --> 07:58.200
4 years with the last 5 years will bring us 30 units of income

07:59.200 --> 08:05.200
We need to get 10 more units for the return of investment

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
Therefore, it is 1 third of the amount

08:08.200 --> 08:18.200
Thus, we can say that the period of payback in this case will be 4.1 years

08:18.200 --> 08:24.200
The next rule is the use of the profitability index

08:24.200 --> 08:30.200
The profitability index is almost the same as the NPV, but expressed in percents

08:30.200 --> 08:42.200
If we found a difference between the investment in the project and the income from the project

08:43.200 --> 08:53.200
In this case, we need to find the relationship between the two amounts

08:53.200 --> 08:56.200
You can see an example here

08:56.200 --> 09:07.200
If the income from the project is 130 units, our investment in the project is 100 units

09:07.200 --> 09:11.200
The profitability index gives us 130%

09:12.200 --> 09:16.200
The rule of application is very simple

09:16.200 --> 09:21.200
If the index is greater than 1, we accept the project, if it is less, we reject it

09:21.200 --> 09:26.200
If it is greater than 1, it means that the NPV is greater than 0

09:26.200 --> 09:29.200
If it is less than 1, it means that the NPV is less than 0

09:29.200 --> 09:36.200
There are situations when you compare different projects, but with different amounts

09:37.200 --> 09:42.200
The profitability index allows you to move away from absolute numbers and move to relative numbers

09:42.200 --> 09:48.200
Now about the internal profitability rate

09:48.200 --> 09:50.200
This is the next slide

09:50.200 --> 09:56.200
It is quite interesting and the moment when many people start to get confused

09:56.200 --> 09:59.200
Although there is nothing complicated there

10:00.200 --> 10:05.200
The internal profitability rate is a percentage rate

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
In which the NPV of the project is 0

10:08.200 --> 10:13.200
Of course, it should be a project with a positive NPV

10:13.200 --> 10:19.200
Then the internal profitability rate will be positive

10:19.200 --> 10:24.200
The internal profitability rate cannot be negative

10:24.200 --> 10:30.200
Any percentage rate cannot be negative

10:30.200 --> 10:34.200
Look at the slide

10:34.200 --> 10:37.200
At the formula that is written there

10:37.200 --> 10:41.200
You see that the example with an investment project

10:41.200 --> 10:44.200
Where we have 100 units of investments

10:44.200 --> 10:48.200
And for the first 4 years and the last 30 years

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
Our cash flows

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
What about the indicators?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.200
The indicators have the same value

10:56.200 --> 10:57.200
IRR

10:57.200 --> 11:05.200
Unfortunately, there is no mathematical formula to calculate IRR

11:05.200 --> 11:12.200
The easiest way is to find this rate in the computer

11:12.200 --> 11:18.200
For example, IRR is 9.0%

11:18.200 --> 11:23.200
This means that at the cost of resources on the market

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
At the cost of money

11:25.200 --> 11:28.200
9.0%

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
9.18%

11:30.200 --> 11:33.200
Your project will have a zero NPV

11:33.200 --> 11:40.200
But if you have a rate that you can discount

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
A rate at which you attract money

11:42.200 --> 11:46.200
Or a rate at which you must work

11:46.200 --> 11:51.200
Less than 6%

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
7%

11:52.200 --> 11:56.200
Then you will definitely have a positive NPV

11:56.200 --> 12:00.200
So, if IRR

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
Internal profitability rate

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
This is the rule

12:03.200 --> 12:06.200
If IRR is more profitable

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
More market profitability

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Or required profitability

12:08.200 --> 12:11.200
The project can be accepted

12:12.200 --> 12:23.200
We can also say that IRR is a kind of indicator of the project's strength, reliability, and stability

12:23.200 --> 12:26.200
It is a kind of a reserve of the project's strength

12:26.200 --> 12:30.200
The greater the difference between IRR and market profitability

12:30.200 --> 12:35.200
The more stable your project will be in the future

12:35.200 --> 12:37.200
The more reliable your project will be in the future

12:38.200 --> 12:41.200
We make investment decisions

12:41.200 --> 12:45.200
We are forced to predict the future, which is not determined

12:45.200 --> 12:53.200
Therefore, the more stable the project is in relation to the risk of changing the interest rate in the future

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
The better

12:55.200 --> 12:59.200
Therefore, when making a decision, you must focus

12:59.200 --> 13:02.200
When making a decision, when choosing investment projects

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
You must focus on the NPV, its absolute value

13:06.200 --> 13:08.200
The period of profitability

13:08.200 --> 13:09.200
The profitability index

13:09.200 --> 13:11.200
And IRR

13:11.200 --> 13:13.200
All these parameters together

13:13.200 --> 13:15.200
Will give you information

13:15.200 --> 13:18.200
About how profitable this project is

13:18.200 --> 13:20.200
How much it will increase capital

13:20.200 --> 13:23.200
How fast it will pay off

13:23.200 --> 13:26.200
And how stable it will be in the future

13:27.200 --> 13:32.200
Each of these parameters should not be used separately

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
Only together

13:33.200 --> 13:36.200
Another question arises

13:36.200 --> 13:40.200
Since IRR and NPV intersect in something

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
Which of these two parameters is better?

13:43.200 --> 13:49.200
Can't we use one parameter to assess the investment project?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
Why use a lot?

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
There are such situations, such questions

13:54.200 --> 13:56.200
What is better?

13:56.200 --> 14:00.200
The absolute value of NPV or the relative value of IRR?

14:02.200 --> 14:06.200
The question is controversial, there is no definite answer

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
But here we need to clarify

14:08.200 --> 14:12.200
That IRR, unlike NPV, is a capricious lady

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
And has its nuances

14:14.200 --> 14:17.200
Before we talk about these nuances

14:17.200 --> 14:21.200
It should be clarified that there are different types of money flows

14:21.200 --> 14:25.200
And depending on the type, there can be nuances related to IRR

14:25.200 --> 14:29.200
There are three main types of money flows

14:29.200 --> 14:32.200
Traditional money flow

14:32.200 --> 14:36.200
This is a traditional money flow

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
A borrowed money flow

14:38.200 --> 14:43.200
And several types of non-traditional money flows

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
Let's start with the traditional

14:45.200 --> 14:47.200
Traditional money flow

14:47.200 --> 14:51.200
It means that you spent money at first

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
That is, you have a flow at first

14:53.200 --> 14:56.200
And then every period you have a flow of money

14:56.200 --> 15:00.200
A borrowed type of money flows

15:00.200 --> 15:04.200
It assumes that you have attracted resources from somewhere

15:04.200 --> 15:09.200
And then you spend them gradually every period

15:09.200 --> 15:14.200
Finally, non-traditional is a combination of the first two

15:14.200 --> 15:17.200
But in a situation where over time

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
Your money flows change signs

15:20.200 --> 15:25.200
That is, today you invested money, it is a flow

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
Then you had inflows for three years in a row

15:28.200 --> 15:33.200
And then, for example, in 2004 you had some problems

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
You have a flow of money resources

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
And then again an inflow

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
This will be a non-traditional money flow

15:39.200 --> 15:45.200
And it leads to the fact that you have not one IRR, but two

15:45.200 --> 15:47.200
Oddly enough

15:47.200 --> 15:50.200
So, what do money flows look like?

15:50.200 --> 15:55.200
The following slide shows us what a traditional money flow looks like

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
Pay attention

15:56.200 --> 16:00.200
With the growth of profitability, the NPV is reduced

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
This is quite natural

16:02.200 --> 16:05.200
With the growth of profitability, the NPV is reduced

16:05.200 --> 16:16.200
And IRR is the point where the line of our project intersects the horizontal axis

16:16.200 --> 16:20.200
A borrowed type of money flow is a reverse line

16:20.200 --> 16:23.200
By the way, the lines may not necessarily be curved

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
The project line can be straight

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
So it's just a drawing

16:27.200 --> 16:33.200
NPV on this drawing, you see, grows with the growth of profitability

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
This is a borrowed type of money flow

16:36.200 --> 16:39.200
Finally, a non-traditional money flow

16:39.200 --> 16:41.200
One of its varieties

16:41.200 --> 16:44.200
In this case, it is a borrowed money flow

16:44.200 --> 16:49.200
You see that with the growth of profitability, the NPV grows

16:49.200 --> 16:53.200
Then there is a moment, a point of X-interruption

16:53.200 --> 17:01.200
After which, with the growth of profitability, the NPV begins to fall

17:02.200 --> 17:06.200
In this case, we will have two IRRs in the project

17:09.200 --> 17:18.200
In principle, the maximum number of IRRs is the number of times that money flows change the sign from positive to negative or vice versa

17:18.200 --> 17:26.200
It is obvious that with the multiplicity of IRRs in the project, its use is not purposeful

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
There is nothing to talk about

17:28.200 --> 17:32.200
But if for some reason you want to have this parameter

17:32.200 --> 17:38.200
You can do a recalculation and get rid of negative money flows

17:38.200 --> 17:45.200
And thus bring your project to a traditional or borrowed type

17:45.200 --> 17:47.200
How can this be done?

17:47.200 --> 17:52.200
Let's look at the next two slides

17:52.200 --> 17:56.200
So, this will be an example of recalculation

17:56.200 --> 18:04.200
We have a project in which we spend 100 units in the first year

18:04.200 --> 18:09.200
Then in the second year we get 60 units of income

18:09.200 --> 18:12.200
Then we get 70 units of income

18:12.200 --> 18:19.200
And in the last year, for some reason, we have a flow of money in the amount of 10 units

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
In other words, some additional investment

18:21.200 --> 18:25.200
What does this mean?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.200
This means that we will have two IRRs

18:27.200 --> 18:29.200
But not very good

18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
How can we get rid of this?

18:32.200 --> 18:38.200
To do this, you need to get rid of minus 10 units

18:38.200 --> 18:42.200
From the sum where we have minus 10 units

18:42.200 --> 18:52.200
To do this, you need to bring minus 10 units of the money flow of the fourth year

18:52.200 --> 18:58.200
To a type comparable to the money flows of the third year

18:58.200 --> 19:02.200
And in the next slide you will see how we do it

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
Please note

19:04.200 --> 19:08.200
Minus 10 units is money from the fourth year

19:09.200 --> 19:15.200
You can get rid of them if you bring them to a comparable type with the third year

19:15.200 --> 19:17.200
The next year, the fourth

19:17.200 --> 19:19.200
So, what are we doing for this?

19:19.200 --> 19:23.200
We must discount minus 10 units for one year

19:23.200 --> 19:28.200
We discounted minus 10 units, we got, for example, minus 8 units

19:28.200 --> 19:31.200
This is not a principal value, but for example, minus 8

19:31.200 --> 19:39.200
Then our formula for determining NPV will look like this

19:39.200 --> 19:44.200
Two last sums, 70 remains unchanged

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
1 plus R to the third degree

19:46.200 --> 19:49.200
But the fourth sum has already changed its appearance

19:49.200 --> 19:53.200
This is minus 8, 1 plus R to the third degree

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
The third and fourth sums are comparable

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
They can be reduced

19:58.200 --> 20:04.200
As a result of the reduction, 70 minus 8 remains 62

20:04.200 --> 20:07.200
Thus, please note

20:07.200 --> 20:13.200
We got a formula, we got a new money flow, so to speak

20:13.200 --> 20:19.200
In which there are minus 100 units of spending at the moment

20:19.200 --> 20:21.200
During the current year

20:21.200 --> 20:26.200
And two positive money flows for the next two years

20:26.200 --> 20:37.200
This is the equivalent of the money flow we considered at the beginning

20:37.200 --> 20:42.200
Namely, 60 after 2 years, 70 after 3, minus 10 after 4

20:42.200 --> 20:51.200
Thus, we got rid of the minus and brought our calculation to the traditional money flow

20:51.200 --> 20:53.200
Now we will have one NPV

20:53.200 --> 20:55.200
It can be used

20:55.200 --> 20:57.200
One nuance

20:57.200 --> 21:02.200
To discuss it, we will return to the CIPM and VACC model

21:02.200 --> 21:04.200
It would seem

21:04.200 --> 21:06.200
If we know the profitability of our project

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
10%

21:08.200 --> 21:11.200
Then we can calculate VACC

21:11.200 --> 21:15.200
And depending on the capital expenditure

21:15.200 --> 21:17.200
Say

21:17.200 --> 21:20.200
Does this income suit us or not?

21:20.200 --> 21:27.200
For example, our capital expenditures are 12%

21:27.200 --> 21:30.200
12% is our capital expenditure

21:30.200 --> 21:33.200
Our project's profitability is 10%

21:33.200 --> 21:37.200
In theory, it seems that we should refuse it

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
But this is not the right approach

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
We can't say it without an operation

21:41.200 --> 21:48.200
First of all, because, let's repeat, VACC does not take into account the risk factor

21:48.200 --> 21:51.200
There are no discounting elements

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
Pay attention to the next slide

21:54.200 --> 22:00.200
It shows two lines

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
The first horizontal line shows the VACC rate

22:05.200 --> 22:10.200
It does not change depending on the project's risk

22:10.200 --> 22:16.200
In this case, the risk of the financial asset is expressed in the beta coefficient

22:16.200 --> 22:21.200
No matter how the risk changes, VACC remains unchanged

22:21.200 --> 22:27.200
At the same time, the calculation of the CIPM model

22:27.200 --> 22:32.200
This is the second horizontal line, it is called SML

22:32.200 --> 22:42.200
The CIPM model shows how the risk and profitability of the financial asset are related

22:42.200 --> 22:48.200
Now, pay attention to the gray field on the right

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
It says, a non-profitable project

22:50.200 --> 22:55.200
If there is a dot with the word non-profitable project

22:55.200 --> 22:59.200
If there is the profitability and risk of our project

22:59.200 --> 23:02.200
It turns out to be an interesting picture

23:02.200 --> 23:06.200
The profitability of our project is higher than the VACC value

23:06.200 --> 23:09.200
It would seem that we should accept it

23:09.200 --> 23:13.200
But no, such a project should not be accepted

23:13.200 --> 23:15.200
Only because it is higher than VACC

23:15.200 --> 23:19.200
The fact is that it is less than the CIPM

23:19.200 --> 23:23.200
Which takes into account the ratio of risk and profit

23:23.200 --> 23:30.200
In other words, with this value of risk, which is marked with a dot

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
Under the name of a non-profitable project

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
With this value of risk, the profitability should be much higher

23:36.200 --> 23:43.200
Having passed this project, we take on a high risk of non-profitability

23:43.200 --> 23:50.200
The other field is on the left, also a gray field

23:50.200 --> 23:53.200
It is marked with the inscription, a profitable project

23:53.200 --> 23:57.200
If we take a project located in this area

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
It certainly gives less profitability than VACC

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
It would seem that we should refuse it

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
But this is not true

24:05.200 --> 24:11.200
The fact is that this project, with the level of risk it has

24:11.200 --> 24:17.200
Has much more profitability than it should be, according to the logic of things

24:17.200 --> 24:22.200
This is a profitable project, and such a project should be accepted

24:22.200 --> 24:28.200
We have disassembled the basic rules of assessing investment projects

24:29.200 --> 24:33.200
I remind you that the assessment of investment projects is mainly a decision

24:33.200 --> 24:36.200
To accept the project for investment or not to accept it

24:36.200 --> 24:38.200
There are four main parameters

24:38.200 --> 24:41.200
This is NPV, the net value

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
IRR, the internal income rate

24:44.200 --> 24:49.200
And also two parameters that also use the element of discounting

24:49.200 --> 24:53.200
This is the term of the purchase and the profitability index

24:53.200 --> 24:56.200
These are the basic parameters

24:56.200 --> 25:02.200
We also considered the situation related to the multiplicity of the internal income rate

25:02.200 --> 25:07.200
And the interaction of the CAPM and VACC models

25:07.200 --> 25:11.200
I hope you remember what we talked about

25:11.200 --> 25:16.200
I would ask you to get distracted from the video course

25:16.200 --> 25:20.200
And solve the tasks that are presented in the work conspect

25:20.200 --> 25:23.200
And then we will move on to the next topic

25:23.200 --> 25:28.200
Which is related to some nuances of decision-making

25:44.200 --> 25:46.200
We continue

25:46.200 --> 25:50.200
Now I am addressing people who are in the topic

25:51.200 --> 25:58.200
We move on to study how our basic rules, our basic logic

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
Can affect the adoption of certain current decisions

26:01.200 --> 26:06.200
For example, decisions in the part of the financial, in the part of the borrowing policy

26:06.200 --> 26:10.200
For example, in the part of the policy of balance sheets

26:10.200 --> 26:14.200
For example, in the part of the selection of sales volumes

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
You can also talk about the credit policy

26:19.200 --> 26:26.200
Whether to provide or not to provide commercial credit to your partner

26:26.200 --> 26:31.200
You can also talk about the choice of the device

26:31.200 --> 26:36.200
Most suitable from a financial point of view for this project

26:36.200 --> 26:46.200
So, we will start this section with a question that sounds like this

26:46.200 --> 26:50.200
Which borrowing policy within the horizon of planning is better?

26:50.200 --> 26:52.200
There are two options

26:52.200 --> 26:58.200
The first option means that you attract long-term borrowing funds

26:58.200 --> 27:02.200
In the maximum volume

27:02.200 --> 27:08.200
That is, in such a maximum volume that covers all your needs with a surplus

27:08.200 --> 27:15.200
In this case, when you have free funds, and they will be most of the time

27:15.200 --> 27:24.200
In this case, you are temporarily free resources, invest in high-liquid financial assets

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
Maybe the second option

27:26.200 --> 27:31.200
When you attract long-term investments at a minimum

27:31.200 --> 27:40.200
And at the time when you have a need for borrowing funds

27:40.200 --> 27:44.200
And it will almost always arise, that is, there will be a certain shortage

27:44.200 --> 27:51.200
In this case, you will attract short-term borrowing resources from the market

27:51.200 --> 27:55.200
Both of these policies are reflected in the following two slides

27:55.200 --> 27:58.200
Pay attention, the policy of maximum

27:58.200 --> 28:02.200
That is, when you attract resources in the maximum volume

28:02.200 --> 28:08.200
So, the amount and time are reflected in this graph

28:08.200 --> 28:12.200
I mean the need for investment

28:12.200 --> 28:14.200
It is more or less, more or less

28:14.200 --> 28:20.200
There is a certain peak, you can attract long-term financing at this peak

28:20.200 --> 28:25.200
All that is less than this peak, but higher than the needs of your project

28:25.200 --> 28:28.200
These are temporarily free funds that you need to do something with

28:28.200 --> 28:31.200
They need to be invested in high-liquid resources

28:31.200 --> 28:37.200
The following graph shows us the policy of the minimum

28:37.200 --> 28:44.200
It means that you choose a minimum limit from your investment needs

28:44.200 --> 28:49.200
And on this minimum limit you attract long-term borrowing funds

28:49.200 --> 28:53.200
But all that will be higher, pay attention

28:53.200 --> 28:57.200
Except for one case, in all other cases on the graph

28:57.200 --> 29:01.200
You will need to attract additional borrowing funds

29:01.200 --> 29:05.200
These will be short-term, for example, bank loans

29:06.200 --> 29:10.200
The choice of two policies, which one to choose

29:10.200 --> 29:13.200
The policy of the maximum or the policy of the minimum

29:13.200 --> 29:17.200
Depends on the cost of these resources

29:17.200 --> 29:19.200
On your costs for these resources

29:19.200 --> 29:23.200
Here the recommendation can only be in words

29:23.200 --> 29:30.200
You need to calculate the costs for one policy, the costs for the second policy

29:30.200 --> 29:33.200
Keep in mind that in the first case, the policy of the maximum

29:33.200 --> 29:38.200
You will also have a profit from reinvesting in temporary funds

29:38.200 --> 29:42.200
Somewhere between these two policies will be the golden mean

29:42.200 --> 29:45.200
Where you need to choose by the method of selection

29:45.200 --> 29:50.200
How, taking into account your costs for borrowing funds and repayment from them

29:50.200 --> 29:58.200
I draw your attention to the fact that you will have a certain gap in interest rates

29:58.200 --> 30:09.200
Namely, the interest rates on which you will invest will differ from the interest rates on which you will attract, even short-term resources

30:09.200 --> 30:11.200
And the last thing on this topic

30:11.200 --> 30:16.200
Why do we generally divide long-term investment and short-term?

30:16.200 --> 30:18.200
Why do we highlight two policies?

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
The fact is that, I think it should also be obvious to you

30:21.200 --> 30:29.200
That the interest rates on long-term resources and short-term resources are different from each other

30:29.200 --> 30:35.200
Due to the fact that there is less risk in short-term loans

30:35.200 --> 30:40.200
Therefore, the interest rate there should theoretically be lower than in the long-term

30:40.200 --> 30:45.200
The next point is related to the management of balance sheets

30:45.200 --> 30:49.200
The basic question that sounds here is the following

30:49.200 --> 30:53.200
What should be the desired level of money on the accounts?

30:53.200 --> 31:02.200
This intersects with the previous question regarding the choice of financing policy for the project

31:02.200 --> 31:14.200
There are a number of models that suggest you calculate the recommended balance on the accounts

31:14.200 --> 31:28.200
Please note that there is a set of formulas in the work conspectus that you can use in your work

31:28.200 --> 31:35.200
I will only add one point, I will not comment on the formula, it is quite obvious

31:35.200 --> 31:37.200
I will add only the following

31:37.200 --> 31:49.200
It makes sense to determine the time when you have a profit or a deficit of funds on the account

31:49.200 --> 31:56.200
After you determine this, discount them all, calculate their given value

31:56.200 --> 32:03.200
Determine the NPV, the NPV analog for the deficit and profit of funds on the account

32:03.200 --> 32:12.200
Then you will find out if you have excess or a shortage of resources on the horizon of planning

32:12.200 --> 32:22.200
Further, if you break this whole period into separate parts, you will see when you need to create a reserve

32:22.200 --> 32:35.200
If you have a deficit ahead, or an opportunity to invest resources if you have a profit ahead

32:35.200 --> 32:39.200
In any case, the general approach is the same as in the previous item

32:39.200 --> 32:46.200
You discount the deficit and profit and try to find the NPV analog

32:47.200 --> 32:54.200
If you consider these two points preparatory, then now it's more interesting

32:54.200 --> 33:01.200
More interesting is called providing or not providing a loan to a client

33:01.200 --> 33:07.200
A topic that concerns all enterprises, without exception

33:07.200 --> 33:18.200
Many times enterprises face the fact that the client asks for a loan for some reason

33:18.200 --> 33:22.200
And sometimes the client leaves without receiving a loan

33:22.200 --> 33:31.200
Sometimes, having received a loan, the client is so happy that he buys more or becomes a regular client

33:32.200 --> 33:39.200
Let's consider two situations related to credit policy

33:39.200 --> 33:44.200
For both situations, we will have some general parameters

33:44.200 --> 33:50.200
Please pay attention to the slide related to credit policy

33:50.200 --> 33:53.200
We will have several variables

33:53.200 --> 33:55.200
The first is the price of the product

33:55.200 --> 33:59.200
We will take the figure of 35 units for the calculation

33:59.200 --> 34:01.200
The price of the product is the digit P

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
V is the variable costs

34:03.200 --> 34:08.200
The letter P is the probability that the client will not pay it after receiving the loan

34:08.200 --> 34:14.200
I repeat, this is the probability that the client will not pay it after receiving the loan

34:14.200 --> 34:19.200
And finally, R is the profitability of the debitor's debt

34:19.200 --> 34:22.200
So, the first situation

34:22.200 --> 34:27.200
The client will make a purchase only if he is provided with a loan

34:27.200 --> 34:30.200
This is a rather tough situation

34:30.200 --> 34:34.200
The client will make a purchase only if he is provided with a loan

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
Otherwise, he will refuse

34:36.200 --> 34:39.200
What does the company have in this case?

34:39.200 --> 34:42.200
It has two situations

34:42.200 --> 34:46.200
In the first situation, it has two options for the development of the event

34:46.200 --> 34:53.200
The first is that the company refuses to provide a loan to this stubborn client

34:53.200 --> 34:57.200
who only wants a loan, otherwise he will refuse

34:57.200 --> 34:59.200
The first situation is that the company refuses

34:59.200 --> 35:03.200
In this case, it has no increase in cash flows

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
Everything is zero

35:05.200 --> 35:11.200
The second situation is when the company goes to meet this client and gives him a loan

35:11.200 --> 35:18.200
In this case, the company spends only variable costs

35:19.200 --> 35:26.200
but plans to get a certain amount of cash flow in return

35:26.200 --> 35:28.200
Pay attention to the slide

35:28.200 --> 35:38.200
The cash flow is 1-pi multiplied by the price of the product

35:38.200 --> 35:42.200
Again, 1-pi multiplied by the price of the product

35:42.200 --> 35:50.200
This is the calculated amount of cash flow that the company will receive from the client

35:50.200 --> 35:52.200
given that the client may not pay

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
We have a probability that the client will not pay in the amount of pi

35:56.200 --> 35:58.200
I repeat again

35:58.200 --> 36:03.200
If the company gives a loan, it risks its variable costs

36:03.200 --> 36:08.200
but in return receives a price of the product multiplied by 1-pi

36:08.200 --> 36:13.200
This is the calculated amount of cash flow that the client will receive

36:13.200 --> 36:19.200
Now, if we put all these numbers together, we can build a formula

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
Pay attention to the slide

36:21.200 --> 36:26.200
The logic is the same as everywhere

36:26.200 --> 36:30.200
NPV is the difference between income and expenses

36:30.200 --> 36:33.200
Our expenses are today's variable costs

36:33.200 --> 36:36.200
They go with a minus sign

36:36.200 --> 36:38.200
Minus V

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
Plus

36:40.200 --> 36:43.200
Discounted payment

36:43.200 --> 36:45.200
I repeat again

36:45.200 --> 36:49.200
This is a variable client who will refuse to buy if he is not given a loan

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
but may not pay

36:51.200 --> 36:57.200
So, a variable client, after a period of money payment

36:58.200 --> 37:03.200
In the end, the NPV of this decision

37:03.200 --> 37:07.200
whether to give him a loan or not, looks like this

37:07.200 --> 37:11.200
If we use the numbers we had

37:11.200 --> 37:17.200
we get the line that says NPV is equal to minus 15 and so on

37:17.200 --> 37:22.200
If, for example, we take a certain figure of 30%

37:22.200 --> 37:28.200
Suppose 30% of clients do not pay even after receiving a loan

37:28.200 --> 37:36.200
30% of clients are not reliable

37:36.200 --> 37:40.200
Even in this case, the NPV of this decision will be greater than 0

37:40.200 --> 37:45.200
Accordingly, it turns out that if you give a loan

37:45.200 --> 37:52.200
quite often, so that it can be considered a statistically significant action

37:52.200 --> 37:57.200
then even with 30% of refugees

37:57.200 --> 38:00.200
you will still have a positive inflow of resources

38:00.200 --> 38:03.200
This decision will be correct

38:03.200 --> 38:11.200
By the way, to fix this moment for you

38:12.200 --> 38:17.200
you can pause now and calculate these numbers

38:17.200 --> 38:22.200
Try to determine at what value of Pi, that is, the number of refugees

38:22.200 --> 38:26.200
at what value of Pi the NPV will be zero

38:26.200 --> 38:32.200
That is, above what value of Pi, you cannot give a loan

38:32.200 --> 38:34.200
Please calculate

38:34.200 --> 38:36.200
Now we move on to the next question

38:36.200 --> 38:39.200
The next question is the second situation

38:39.200 --> 38:42.200
The first situation was a one-time process

38:42.200 --> 38:45.200
You give me a loan, and I buy you

38:45.200 --> 38:47.200
Now the second situation

38:47.200 --> 38:51.200
The client who made a purchase once becomes a regular buyer

38:51.200 --> 38:56.200
The client who made a purchase once becomes a regular buyer

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
and in the future does not refuse to buy

38:58.200 --> 39:01.200
Quite a realistic assumption

39:01.200 --> 39:04.200
There is no doubt about it

39:04.200 --> 39:06.200
It happens quite often

39:06.200 --> 39:08.200
Let's consider

39:08.200 --> 39:13.200
If the company does not provide a loan, then nothing will happen to it

39:13.200 --> 39:16.200
If the company provides a loan, then

39:16.200 --> 39:21.200
On the one hand, it risks its variable costs

39:21.200 --> 39:23.200
Their volume is V

39:23.200 --> 39:32.200
But then it can get a value of P

39:32.200 --> 39:34.200
if the client pays

39:35.200 --> 39:42.200
It turns out that in the next period

39:42.200 --> 39:46.200
the company either does not receive anything

39:46.200 --> 39:48.200
because the client does not pay

39:48.200 --> 39:53.200
or receives a full payment if the client pays

39:53.200 --> 39:57.200
But since we assumed that he pays regularly

39:57.200 --> 40:04.200
then there will be a constant difference between P and V

40:04.200 --> 40:12.200
The cash flow over a period will be the difference between the cost of the product and the variable costs

40:12.200 --> 40:16.200
Please pay attention to the slide on which the second situation is described

40:19.200 --> 40:21.200
Let's move on to the next slide

40:21.200 --> 40:31.200
The cost of each new client will be estimated as the revenue minus the cost of the company divided by R

40:31.200 --> 40:34.200
Please remember the formula for the current cost

40:34.200 --> 40:41.200
Please remember the formula for the valuation of the share price with a constant dividend

40:41.200 --> 40:43.200
Don't you think this formula is similar?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.200
Absolutely right!

40:45.200 --> 40:47.200
It is the same formula

40:48.200 --> 40:55.200
But instead of the dividend, we have a difference of P minus V

40:55.200 --> 40:59.200
Now, about the effectiveness of lending

40:59.200 --> 41:02.200
We must calculate the NPV of this solution

41:02.200 --> 41:06.200
I repeat that we spend the variable costs

41:06.200 --> 41:12.200
But on the other hand, we get a certain flow of money

41:12.200 --> 41:15.200
This flow is constant

41:16.200 --> 41:18.200
What does it mean?

41:18.200 --> 41:24.200
It means that on the one hand, the amount is the difference between P and V

41:24.200 --> 41:31.200
and on the other hand, there should be a correction for the risk of not fulfilling their obligations

41:31.200 --> 41:33.200
The risk of the client not paying

41:33.200 --> 41:36.200
This risk remains, it has not been canceled

41:36.200 --> 41:40.200
As a result, our formula will look like this

41:40.200 --> 41:50.200
We must adjust the cost of each new client to the percentage of non-return money

41:50.200 --> 41:58.200
and compare it with our costs for this solution

41:58.200 --> 42:05.200
As a result, we get the difference between the variable costs and the cost of each new client

42:05.200 --> 42:08.200
with a correction for the risk of not fulfilling their obligations

42:08.200 --> 42:13.200
Let's see what happens with this formula, which is reflected in our slide

42:13.200 --> 42:22.200
It turns out that to find out the client's payment ability costs only 15 units

42:22.200 --> 42:24.200
These are our variable costs

42:24.200 --> 42:29.200
The cost of the client is an incredibly large amount

42:29.200 --> 42:32.200
451 units

42:32.200 --> 42:35.200
We calculated this according to the first formula

42:35.200 --> 42:41.200
If we now calculate the NPV of our decision to provide a loan under such conditions

42:41.200 --> 42:50.200
If we take even 30% of the non-return money, it turns out that the NPV is still positive

42:50.200 --> 42:54.200
The cost of our client is more than 400

42:54.200 --> 42:59.200
The costs to find out this case are only 15

42:59.200 --> 43:06.200
If we take a look, the share of non-return money can be 70-80%

43:06.200 --> 43:09.200
Please count the rest of the non-return money

43:09.200 --> 43:19.200
This situation emphasizes once again that the provision of commercial loans is a very profitable business

43:19.200 --> 43:27.200
Of course, it is risky, because no one canceled a 100% refusal of a loan

43:27.200 --> 43:31.200
Nevertheless, according to our calculations, it is very profitable

43:31.200 --> 43:38.200
It is not surprising that many companies are activating their activities in terms of providing such loans

43:38.200 --> 43:40.200
Let's move on

43:40.200 --> 43:48.200
Now we will consider the topic of NPV and sales volume interconnection

43:48.200 --> 43:53.200
Interconnection of decision-making in the field of sales volume and NPV

43:54.200 --> 44:02.200
Of course, we can consider other topics, such as the connection of NPV with amortization, with taxes

44:02.200 --> 44:04.200
But the logic is the same everywhere

44:04.200 --> 44:06.200
We will consider it in this example

44:06.200 --> 44:09.200
So, the basic question

44:09.200 --> 44:19.200
At what level of sales will the company be provided with financial profitability?

44:19.200 --> 44:22.200
We will consider three levels of profitability

44:22.200 --> 44:26.200
Minimum, calculated and financial

44:26.200 --> 44:35.200
As you understand, the financial profitability level is the level at which the NPV of the project, the NPV of the business is zero

44:35.200 --> 44:38.200
These are very high requirements for the project

44:38.200 --> 44:52.200
Calculated profitability level is the level at which the company can cover its permanent costs and amortization

44:52.200 --> 44:54.200
Permanent costs and amortization

44:54.200 --> 45:03.200
Finally, there is the simplest level, the first level, the so-called minimum profitability level

45:03.200 --> 45:08.200
This is the level of sales at which the NPV covers only the permanent costs

45:08.200 --> 45:14.200
Of course, there can be no profit, no amortization

45:14.200 --> 45:17.200
This is just the covering of the permanent costs

45:17.200 --> 45:22.200
We will operate the term Operational cash flow

45:22.200 --> 45:24.200
OSF

45:24.200 --> 45:30.200
This is one of the options for direct calculation of cash flows

45:30.200 --> 45:36.200
It includes the company's income up to the deduction of interest and taxes

45:36.200 --> 45:40.200
Plus amortization and minus taxes

45:40.200 --> 45:50.200
At the minimum profitability level, the operational cash flow should be zero

45:51.200 --> 46:12.200
At the calculated profitability level, the company's cash flows should cover the permanent costs and cover amortization

46:12.200 --> 46:20.200
Finally, at the financial profitability level, we should get the operational cash flows in full

46:20.200 --> 46:25.200
But with such calculations to achieve zero NPV

46:25.200 --> 46:29.200
Please refer to our slides

46:29.200 --> 46:38.200
You can see that there is a dependence between the operational cash flows and the volume of sales

46:38.200 --> 46:42.200
The formula of this dependence is presented on the slide

46:42.200 --> 46:47.200
Where Q is the volume of sales and F is the permanent costs

46:47.200 --> 46:54.200
P-V is the price of the product minus the variable costs

46:54.200 --> 46:56.200
We are already familiar with the terms

46:56.200 --> 47:05.200
The formula of the minimum profitability level is presented on the same slide

47:05.200 --> 47:13.200
The difference between all three formulas will be in the volume of numbers

47:13.200 --> 47:16.200
Please note

47:16.200 --> 47:21.200
The minimum profitability level is Q

47:21.200 --> 47:25.200
We substitute the value formula

47:25.200 --> 47:28.200
Let's start with the denominator

47:28.200 --> 47:30.200
41 minus 21

47:30.200 --> 47:34.200
The difference between the price of the product and the variable costs

47:34.200 --> 47:38.200
Now let's go up to the denominator

47:38.200 --> 47:42.200
The denominator has a number 600 on the left

47:42.200 --> 47:45.200
These are the permanent costs

47:45.200 --> 47:47.200
On the right we have zero

47:47.200 --> 47:51.200
This means that the operational cash flow is zero

47:51.200 --> 47:55.200
There is no amortization, no profit, etc.

47:55.200 --> 48:05.200
In order to ensure the minimum profitability level, this company must sell 30 units of its product

48:05.200 --> 48:13.200
With this volume of sales, this company can cover its permanent costs

48:13.200 --> 48:16.200
Now let's move on to the next slide

48:16.200 --> 48:25.200
Here, unlike the previous formula, the difference is only in the number above the line on the right

48:25.200 --> 48:33.200
Please note that the same 600 permanent costs, the same price of the product 41 minus 21

48:33.200 --> 48:42.200
But only now we have 640 units of amortization in the structure of the operational cash flow

48:43.200 --> 48:55.200
In order for the company to cover amortization and cover permanent costs, it must produce 62 units of its product

48:55.200 --> 48:59.200
Produce and sell

48:59.200 --> 49:02.200
Let's make an addition

49:02.200 --> 49:04.200
Produce and sell

49:04.200 --> 49:07.200
This was the calculated profit-free sales level

49:07.200 --> 49:20.200
Now we need to determine the financial profit-free sales level, with which this project is provided by zero NPV

49:20.200 --> 49:30.200
To do this, we need to determine the cost, the annual size of the operational cash flow

49:30.200 --> 49:36.200
Which will include the amortization of those 40-640 units we talked about

49:37.200 --> 49:47.200
Please pay attention to our slide, everything is described there

49:47.200 --> 49:57.200
I will only say that the total investment of the project is 3.2 million

49:57.200 --> 50:00.200
The annual income is 20%

50:00.200 --> 50:07.200
We need to determine the annual cash flow

50:07.200 --> 50:10.200
Since the project is designed for 5 years

50:10.200 --> 50:14.200
What should be the annual cash flow

50:14.200 --> 50:20.200
Please remember that we went through the model of the cost of annuity

50:20.200 --> 50:33.200
This model assumes that you can calculate the cost of a set, a series, annual payments of the same amount

50:33.200 --> 50:38.200
If you know this amount, the number of years or periods and the interest rate

50:38.200 --> 50:46.200
In this case, the interest rate is 20, the number of years is 5, and the total amount is known

50:46.200 --> 50:51.200
We know the cost of annuity, but we don't know the amount

50:51.200 --> 50:55.200
In the formula, it was the size of the coupon

50:55.200 --> 51:03.200
In this formula, we talk about the parameters of operational cash flow

51:03.200 --> 51:08.200
We use the capitalization coefficient

51:08.200 --> 51:19.200
As a result, we get that the annual nominal cost of the company's cash flows is 1070 units

51:19.200 --> 51:26.200
Every year, 1070 units should be generated by this project

51:27.200 --> 51:36.200
In order to ensure the financial profitability of our project

51:36.200 --> 51:47.200
You probably noticed that we took 3,200, the cost of our investments

51:47.200 --> 51:56.200
We could say that we have the cost of investments, we have the cash flow from these investments

51:56.200 --> 52:02.200
But their cost, I repeat,

52:02.200 --> 52:07.200
If we took a different number, not 3,200

52:07.200 --> 52:12.200
For example, we would say that we have the cash flow from our project of 3,300

52:12.200 --> 52:17.200
Then we would calculate for our cash flow OSF

52:17.200 --> 52:22.200
Based on the fact that the NPV is greater than 0

52:22.200 --> 52:27.200
In this case, we take 3,200

52:27.200 --> 52:34.200
This number corresponds to both the investment and the cash flow from our project

52:34.200 --> 52:38.200
Since the two numbers are the same, the NPV is 0

52:38.200 --> 52:48.200
When we set the value of the operational cash flow, we get 83.5

52:48.200 --> 52:56.200
This means that the company must sell 84 units of goods annually

52:56.200 --> 53:05.200
To ensure the financial profitability level, that is, to ensure the NPV of its project

53:05.200 --> 53:14.200
We note that 85 units of goods should be produced under the conditions of this project

53:14.200 --> 53:18.200
Our financial profitability level is 84

53:18.200 --> 53:24.200
The difference is very small, this is a dangerous situation

53:24.200 --> 53:28.200
Because the project has no reserve

53:28.200 --> 53:36.200
Without a reserve, it can become a victim of any negative change in the interest rate on the market

53:36.200 --> 53:42.200
In any case, we have seen three situations

53:42.200 --> 53:50.200
The most important is the last point, namely the financial profitability level

53:50.200 --> 53:55.200
Now we will consider the same, but on a graph

53:55.200 --> 53:57.200
Please refer to the slide

53:57.200 --> 54:06.200
Here you see a line that reflects the dependence between the cash flows and the volume of sales

54:06.200 --> 54:08.200
You see three points here

54:08.200 --> 54:15.200
Minimum level, calculated level and financial profitability level

54:16.200 --> 54:25.200
This is just an illustration, I hope it will help you better remember this point

54:25.200 --> 54:33.200
Of course, the company can work for a while at a minimum level of profitability

54:33.200 --> 54:39.200
Of course, the company can work for a long time at a calculated level of profitability

54:39.200 --> 54:49.200
But in order for the company to count on capital growth, it must exceed the financial profitability level of sales

54:49.200 --> 54:55.200
If the company is counting on the stock market, on the growth of the stock market,

54:55.200 --> 55:06.200
it must operate on the cash flows and strive for the cash flows to exceed the calculated value

55:07.200 --> 55:17.200
The next point is the choice of several devices with the same functions

55:17.200 --> 55:22.200
of the device that is the least financially expensive

55:22.200 --> 55:25.200
Again, I ask you to refer to the slide

55:25.200 --> 55:32.200
The basic question is how to choose a device with the same functions, but with different service terms,

55:32.200 --> 55:36.200
the most profitable from a financial point of view

55:36.200 --> 55:38.200
We will have an example

55:38.200 --> 55:45.200
The logic is very simple, it is based on discounting

55:45.200 --> 55:46.200
Let's look at an example

55:46.200 --> 55:48.200
We have two devices

55:48.200 --> 55:53.200
The first one costs 100 units, it will last for two years

55:53.200 --> 55:57.200
Annual expense for this device is 10 units

55:58.200 --> 56:05.200
The second device costs 140 units, it will last for three years

56:05.200 --> 56:10.200
Annual expense for this device is 8 units

56:10.200 --> 56:13.200
How do we compare these two devices?

56:13.200 --> 56:17.200
We must calculate their cost

56:17.200 --> 56:21.200
The cost of these devices

56:21.200 --> 56:29.200
If it was a finished object that would give a profit,

56:29.200 --> 56:34.200
we would consider it a profit from the project

56:34.200 --> 56:38.200
But in this case, it is a mechanism, a part of the whole

56:38.200 --> 56:45.200
We can evaluate its financial efficiency only from the point of view of the costs for this project

56:45.200 --> 56:46.200
The rule is simple

56:46.200 --> 56:50.200
The lower the costs, the better this device

56:50.200 --> 56:55.200
With the same technical characteristics

56:55.200 --> 56:59.200
Please, look at the slide

56:59.200 --> 57:11.200
We calculate the PV, the cost, and the expense for both devices

57:11.200 --> 57:16.200
The first device is the price of its purchase

57:16.200 --> 57:20.200
Plus the discounted costs for the first year, plus the discounted costs for the second year

57:20.200 --> 57:22.200
It turns out 117 kopecks

57:22.200 --> 57:25.200
The second device is more expensive, 140 kopecks

57:25.200 --> 57:30.200
Plus the costs for the first year, the discounted costs for the second year, and the costs for the third year

57:30.200 --> 57:32.200
All the same discounted

57:32.200 --> 57:35.200
As a result, it turns out 159 units

57:35.200 --> 57:40.200
What is better, 159 or 117?

57:40.200 --> 57:43.200
We can not answer this question

57:43.200 --> 57:49.200
Because these two numbers have different periods, different deadlines

57:49.200 --> 57:53.200
The first number 117 is calculated for 2 years

57:53.200 --> 57:57.200
The second number 159 is calculated for 3 years

57:57.200 --> 58:00.200
It would seem to divide the first one by 2, the second by 3

58:00.200 --> 58:02.200
And here is the solution to the problem

58:02.200 --> 58:04.200
No, this is not the right solution to the problem

58:04.200 --> 58:09.200
This is a solution for accounting, for the nominal economy

58:09.200 --> 58:13.200
We are talking about an economy where there is a discounting procedure

58:13.200 --> 58:20.200
Therefore, we must use, again, we return to the model of evaluating the cost of annuity

58:20.200 --> 58:30.200
In this case, these 117 and 159 are the cost of an annuity

58:30.200 --> 58:36.200
The cost of annuity, which in one case is two years, in another case is three years

58:36.200 --> 58:52.200
Again, we look at our slide and see that the cost of annuity for the first device is 67 units

58:52.200 --> 58:55.200
For the second 64 units

58:56.200 --> 59:05.200
Again, we have two-year costs, they are 117 and three-year, 159

59:05.200 --> 59:12.200
The cost of the first device is 117 units

59:12.200 --> 59:19.200
This is equivalent to two payments, two equal payments, if we talk about annuity

59:19.200 --> 59:21.200
Two equal payments, the first year and the second year

59:22.200 --> 59:25.200
How do we calculate the sum of one of these payments?

59:25.200 --> 59:28.200
We must use the annuity formula

59:28.200 --> 59:34.200
1.74 is the capitalization coefficient obtained by the formula 14

59:34.200 --> 59:38.200
We need to use the capitalization coefficient for it

59:38.200 --> 59:42.200
The number of years is two years, the interest rate is 10%

59:42.200 --> 59:44.200
We got the capitalization coefficient

59:44.200 --> 59:55.200
We determined that if two times 67 is paid, we get 117

59:55.200 --> 01:00:03.200
The second device is 159, these are the total costs for it, and 2.49 is the capitalization coefficient

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.200
For its calculation, we took the number of years 3 and the interest rate

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:25.200
If 64 is paid three times in a row, the total cost of three 64 units is 159.9

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:31.200
Now we need to compare the two numbers given for one year

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:39.200
Remember, at first we determined the total costs for each device

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.200
And then we brought these costs, which were different in time, to one year

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.200
It turns out about 67, about 64

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:56.200
We must choose the second device, because the costs for it in the annual measurement are less

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.200
The costs for it in the annual measurement are less, they are only 64

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:11.200
At this point, we begin to finish our course, which consists of the basic rules of the investment project assessment

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Some technical solutions that we have just disassembled

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:22.200
The application of these basic rules, namely the application of NPV to the current analysis of economic activity

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.200
In conclusion, we will analyze the last point

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:36.200
The fact is that the company can consider many investment projects at the same time

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:47.200
And it often happens that in the work of one company there are two or three projects

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:55.200
As practice shows, projects can be independent, or they can be dependent

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:01.200
If the projects are independent, then we have no problems

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:11.200
We use the tool we talked about and try to choose the best project, taking into account the realities of the environment

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.200
If they are independent, then the projects can be dependent

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:26.200
In this case, we will name four types of dependence

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:34.200
There is a dependency that replaces, excludes and replaces

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.200
In our slide, they are listed

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Project A and B can be interrelated, dependent

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:52.200
If the implementation of project A leads to the deterioration of project B parameters

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:59.200
Maybe the implementation of project A leads to the improvement of project B parameters

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:07.200
Maybe the implementation of project A leads to the fact that project B cannot be implemented at all

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.200
These are mutually exclusive projects

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.200
When the implementation of one makes the implementation of another impossible

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.200
Or financially unprofitable

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.200
Finally, projects A and B can be called statistically dependent

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:28.200
If they depend on some external event that has a statistical or probability nature

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.200
Please refer to the slides

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.200
We will look at the graph with two mutually exclusive projects A and B

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:49.200
Mutually exclusive is a vivid example of how to act when you have dependent projects

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.200
First, let's look at two lines

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.200
Here we have the vertical of NPV and the horizontal of profitability

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:07.200
We consider the interrelation of NPV and profitability of two of our projects

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.200
They are mutually exclusive

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.200
Project A and B

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.200
The intersection point of these projects is point X

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:22.200
By the way, in the intersection point, as you can guess, the NPV of both projects must be zero

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Now, these projects have IRR

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.200
Here it is marked on the graph

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:36.200
What is interesting, before we move on to the topic

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Before the intersection point X, project B was more profitable than project A

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.200
After the intersection point X, the profitability of the projects changes

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.200
And project A becomes more profitable than project B

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Please note that on this graph, on the left of the internal profitability rates

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.200
There are three dotted lines

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:16.200
They intersect with two fat dots that indicate the points

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:25.200
Please note that at one level of risk, project B has more profitability than project A

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.200
At one level of risk

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.200
This determines that this project is more profitable

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.200
In this case

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.200
If we do the same thing on the right of the intersection point

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.200
We will see the opposite picture

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.200
At the same level of risk, in this case, profitability

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:52.200
Project A will be more profitable than project B

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.200
Its line will be higher than project B

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200
This is for your information

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:07.200
Now, as for the rules of analysis of dependent projects

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:15.200
When you take project A and it affects project B

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.200
You must keep in mind that the money flows that you generate

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:28.200
After taking project A, you must include the changes that occur in project B

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.200
In other words, if you have two mutually exclusive projects

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.200
And you took project A from them

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.200
You took project A

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.200
You will calculate all the money flows

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.200
You must take into account that you did not take project B

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.200
If project B brought you some financial profit

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.200
This means that you are carrying a financial loss

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.200
You must reflect this state on the money flows of project A

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.200
I will repeat it one more time

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.200
You have two projects

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.200
And you can choose only one

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:14.200
After choosing one, you must take into account the consequences of the refusal of the second

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.200
Financial consequences of the refusal of the second

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.200
And add them to the money flows of the basic project

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.200
After that, you make all the standard calculations that we talked about

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.200
NPV, IRR, and everything else

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.200
This was the last remark in this course

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.200
Regarding the analysis of the financial flows of investment projects

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.200
For making investment decisions

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.200
Now we need to sum up our course

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.200
We have considered the need for fundamentally new thinking

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.200
Maybe at some point you lost the thread

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.200
You stopped understanding what we are talking about

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.200
Maybe this is the case

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.200
Please, go back to the beginning

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.200
And try to read the course outline again

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.200
The need for examples of change of thinking

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:19.200
Because this is the basis for understanding the logic of money flows

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200
Although there is nothing wrong with it

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.200
You just need to understand the logic

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.200
The first one is the need for change of thinking

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:32.200
The fact that thinking changes leads to the fact that the price of education on financial assets changes

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.200
This change of thinking on financial assets led us to the fact that

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:45.200
After the course, we started to consider the topic of the valuation of financial assets

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.200
We understood what discounting is

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.200
Then we talked about the effective interest rate

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.200
And asked you to go to the nearest bank to conduct a small study

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.200
Finally, we analyzed three options for the valuation of the value of the asset

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.200
The valuation of the value of the loan, the valuation of the value of the bonds, and the valuation of the value of the shares

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:12.200
Although I repeat that the basis of each of these estimates is the same phenomenon

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.200
Namely, the discounting of the money flows

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.200
Only in the case of a loan, it is the return of the principal amount of the debt along with the interest

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.200
In the case of bonds, it is the payment of coupons and the return of the principal amount of the debt

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.200
And in the case of shares, it is the payment of dividends or another analogue

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.200
Without the return of the principal amount of the debt

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Payment of dividends for an unlimited period

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:41.200
So, we understood this logic, I hope

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:50.200
And our next step was to understand how we will calculate the value of the investment project

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.200
We need to know the discount rate, or rather, we need to be able to choose it

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.200
And we need to be able to calculate the money flows of the investment project

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:06.200
After all, money flows from the shares are mostly dividends

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.200
And the money flows of the project are completely different

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:17.200
We considered possible options, namely the choice of the market index

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.200
The choice of the risk-free rate plus the bonus for the risk

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200
What else did we have?

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.200
Alternative rates, which are available

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:32.200
This was about the possibility of borrowing on the market or investing in alternative projects

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.200
Finally, we have disassembled two models

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.200
Average capital expenditure and the CAPM model

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.200
Estimates of the cost of long-term assets

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:52.200
The CAPM model shows us that the profitability of the share, the profitability of the financial asset, the profitability of the asset and the profitability of the market are interconnected

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.200
And shows this interconnection in the quantitative measurement

01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:07.200
The VISCC, the average capital expenditure, shows us the maximum expenses of this company for the maintenance of its capital

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.200
How much is it worth to maintain capital

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200
This is the main means

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200
How much is it worth to maintain the machine

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.200
How much is it worth to maintain capital

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.200
We also disassembled the money flows

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:29.200
We talked about the method of calculation based on the application of money flows, which is called the indirect method

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:40.200
We had to understand that there are three components of the money flow

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.200
This is the money flow from the main activity, from the investment and from the financial

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200
Adding them together, we get the total amount of the money flow

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:57.200
This amount of money flow must be equal to the difference of the balance in the accounts at the beginning and at the end of the period

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:08.200
To calculate the income from the main activity, we must take the company's profit from the account of profits and losses

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.200
Recover it by the volume of amortization, recover it by the volume of profits and losses

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:21.200
Recover it by the volume of non-realized profits and non-realized losses

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.200
If we take the non-realized profit, we take it with a minus sign

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.200
If we take the loss, we take it with a plus sign

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Then we recover it on the balance sheet

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:38.200
The investment activity is the purchase of securities, the purchase of equipment

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:51.200
And finally, the money flow from the financial activity, namely, the issuance of shares, the issuance of bonds, repayment of debts, repayment of bonds, payment of dividends

01:12:51.200 --> 01:13:00.200
We have figured out how to find a discount rate, how to calculate the money flows of the project

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:08.200
Now we have all the parameters necessary to calculate the cost of the investment project

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.200
We calculate it

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.200
After calculating, we can move on to the main actions

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:32.200
The main actions are to calculate the NPV, the pure cost, the difference between the spent and the income

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:46.200
To calculate the error, the internal income rate, it was about determining at what interest rate the NPV of the project will be equal to zero

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Then there was the profitability index and the period of purchase

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200
Both parameters in discounted terms

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.200
Four main

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:09.200
We have considered several examples of how to use the NPV ideology to analyze the volume of sales,

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:17.200
to analyze the credit policy, to analyze the balance on the accounts,

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:26.200
to analyze the choice of one type of financial policy

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:36.200
Finally, the last thing we need to mention is that investment projects can be dependent

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:42.200
In this case, they lead to a certain adjustment of the money flows

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:54.200
Dependency means that you must take into account the consequences of the project you have chosen

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.200
We can draw a line here

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:05.200
I hope you will solve the tasks presented in the workbook,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.200
you will go through the topic based on these tasks,

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.200
they are not difficult

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:17.200
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that maybe it will be written differently,

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:26.200
but in other words, so that you think about what this parameter means

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.200
But in principle, all the tasks are not difficult

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:39.200
Finally, the last two tasks in the workbook are a squeeze out of some real situations

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.200
where such studies were conducted

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.200
You solve them

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.200
And the last one is a small case that is presented to you

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:55.200
Your task is to recheck the investment project that is laid out there

01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:01.200
The project is not difficult, it is the construction of a dacha settlement in Moscow suburbs

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.200
A very common business

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:09.200
There is NPV, there is IRR, there is a lot of things

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.200
Your task is to recheck these calculated data

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.200
taking into account the objective realities that exist on the market today

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:23.200
and to give your conclusion on how the project is calculated correctly

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.200
And plus, should they be engaged or not

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.200
That's all

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.200
Thank you for your attention

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.200
Thank you for watching
