00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, my name is Elena Proskora. I represent the company Moskva Business School.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
I am an active business coach and consultant in the area of personnel management.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
The theater begins with the hanger, and the entrance to the company is from the selection stage.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
When the company has a personnel service, the main person in charge of this action is the personnel specialist,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
whose main task is to select the personnel.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
The selection of new employees is not only intended to ensure the normal functioning of the enterprise,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
but also the future success of the company.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
We present to your attention the video course on personnel selection.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
The result of this video course should be

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
assistance to the audience in determining their role in the planning and selection process of personnel,

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
acquaintance with the typical sources of workforce, their strengths and weaknesses,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
acquaintance with the selection techniques of various categories of personnel.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Quite often, a rhetorical question arises, who is responsible for hiring new employees?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
It is clear that the personnel is a key factor for the success of any organization,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
and mistakes in selection are too expensive,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
especially when it comes to selecting the management link of the company.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
The impression of the company, which is served by the searchers,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
depends on the professionalism of the company employees involved in the selection process,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
as well as on the subsequent efficiency of the employee's work in a vacant position.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
To improve the selection process and increase the efficiency of personnel selection,

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
the leadership of the structural divisions, in which the personnel is selected, should participate at this stage.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
In this case, the relevance of the understanding of the managers of various levels, principles and procedures

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
operating at this stage and the possession of the necessary knowledge and skills

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
becomes one of the key competencies.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
This is especially important for small and medium-sized businesses,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
where there is not always a staff service and where the leaders of structural divisions or line managers

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
are directly involved in the selection of the personnel.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
In order to distribute the authority between the staff service and the leaders of structural divisions,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
it is necessary to introduce a matrix of responsibility into the company.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
There are difficulties that companies face when organizing the selection and selection system of personnel.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
In particular, some of these problems sound as follows.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
The company does not have a formalized and structured system of selection and selection of personnel.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
As a result, the work is done in a chaotic way, as if from case to case.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
There is no procedure for initiating the search of employees,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
which leads to the orientation of formal requirements to the candidates.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
There are insufficient financial resources to attract external sources or organizations

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
that can be additionally attracted to work in this area.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
The level of qualification of specialists in the field is insufficient.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
The absence of a clear self-image and market positioning of the company as an attractive employer is also a problem.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Before talking about the selection and selection system of personnel,

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
it is necessary to understand the place of selection and selection in the general system of personnel management.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
The selection process is interconnected with other functions and charm.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
In particular, inefficient selection of personnel can lead to the current personnel,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
the reduction of the executive and labor discipline,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
the deterioration of the microclimate,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
the elimination of conflicts and, as a result,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
the formation of an unattractive employer on the labor market.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
The main prerequisites for the effectiveness of the selection stage are the following.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
First of all, these are clear goals of the company, both strategic and tactical.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Effective organizational management structures that correspond to the goals of the company,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
which are designated and formalized.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
The attitude to the functions and charm to the strategic significance

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and understanding of the importance of personnel planning.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Undoubtedly, a complex approach to the search and selection of personnel is necessary.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Regardless of the size of the company,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
the typical business process of selecting personnel can be divided into several sub-processes.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
I would like to list the main ones.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
The first one is the determination of the needs in the personnel.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
The second one is to obtain accurate information about the requirements for the employee

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
that the vacant position proposes.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
The third one is to form a requirement for a candidate or a so-called portrait of a candidate.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
The fourth one is to find effective sources of attracting candidates.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
The fifth one is to determine the methods of selection.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
The sixth one is to conduct a primary interview.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
At this stage, we study the resume,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
conduct a telephone interview and invite to an interview with the applicant.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
The seventh one is to conduct an interview or a series of interviews.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
The eighth one is to make a decision on the invitation of a candidate.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
The ninth one is to direct the invitation to a job or a job offer.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
And the tenth one is to prepare a new employee's workplace.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
The selection process begins with the planning of the personnel.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
The determination of the needs in the personnel or the personnel planning is the main part of the enterprise planning system.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
The personnel planning can be started only after the determination of the personnel policy of the HR strategy.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
If we try to consider the personnel planning isolated from the HR function,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
it will not give the desired result.

05:41.000 --> 05:51.000
The personnel planning is influenced by the production plan, sales plan, turnover plan, financial plan and other plans.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
The personnel planning should take into account all the activities of the enterprise.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
The personnel planning is aimed at determining the quantitative and qualitative needs of the personnel

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
for the strategic and operational purposes of the enterprise.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
The selection process is planned independently of the type of the organization and the vacancies.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
When planning the selection process, it is necessary to plan the work of the employees in the company,

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
so that they can devote as much time as possible to this work and not be distracted by other tasks.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Unfortunately, sometimes the selection process is not paid enough attention.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
Then the selection is carried out chaotically, based on the wishes, and it is unsystematic.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
The consequences of such neglect of planning can be as follows.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
1. Duplication of functions.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
2. Unloaded personnel.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
3. Reduction of the efficiency of the personnel.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
4. Unreasonable increase in the number of personnel and, as a result, increase of the load on the cost part.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It is necessary to start with the analysis of the work.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
The analysis of the work is the central link of the comprehensive approach to the selection of personnel.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
As a result of the analysis of the work, we can develop the positional instructions,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
determine the requirements for the position and establish the criteria used in the selection process for the corresponding position.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
What do we need the positional instructions for?

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
First of all, they determine the main tasks facing the employee and the functional duties that he will perform.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
In addition, according to the labor legislation, in particular, the new edition of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation,

07:37.000 --> 07:46.000
the investigator has the right to familiarize himself with all internal regulatory acts in the personnel section at the selection stage.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
He also has the right to request a positional instruction in which he will familiarize himself with his functional tasks, duties and working conditions.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
The positional instruction must be a living tool and a living document.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Unfortunately, quite often, the positional instruction is a dead child and carries no meaningful load,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
not reflecting the real situation.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Based on the analysis, we can formulate the positional instruction.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
What is a positional instruction?

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
The level of qualification and personal qualities of an employee must be formalized into a positional instruction.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
The positional instruction is divided into several sections.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
The option we offer is available, but you can form your own version of the positional instruction.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
The first section is the information section.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
The information section includes information such as gender, age, date, place of birth, education.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
The professional section consists of work experience, functional duties, achievements, and personal qualities.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
The professional section is a section on personal qualities, personal characteristics.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
The requirements for a position can also be formulated in the form of competencies.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Depending on the category of the personnel, the competencies may be different.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Just like the division into categories, the personnel can also be varied.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
We will follow the most optimal and minimum way and divide the personnel category into two main sections.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
These are the management and specialists.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
The requirements for a position and the competence model indicate the qualities a person should have to successfully perform his work.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
The requirements for a position can also serve as a basis for choosing a method and a plan for an interview with a candidate.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
In the next step, we move on to selection criteria.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
The primary value for improving the effectiveness of selection has a definition of criteria,

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
on the basis of which decisions will be made on the advantages of certain candidates.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Let's take an example.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
Company X requires an evening secretary, aged from 25 to 40 years old,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
education not below the average of a specialist, an active user of a personal computer,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
a knowledge of the system of electronic documents of speed, the speed of a typewriter, 150 beats per minute.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
What does this information tell us?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
It tells us that the company, first of all, by means of the formation of these criteria,

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
separates unnecessary candidates, thereby creating a filter when entering the company.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
The trend of the latest time in the labor market is the formation of a competence model,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
on the basis of which potential candidates are also evaluated,

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
which, in turn, is also a filter at the stage of entering the company.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
What is competence?

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
Competence is knowledge, skills, skills, motivation and personal characteristics

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
necessary for a specialist, but the duties assigned to him,

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
to achieve his functional goals and fulfill his functional duties.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Depending on the category of personnel, competencies can be professional,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
administrative and corporate.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Sometimes there is an additional term, such as personal competencies.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
If we talk about which of the above competencies corresponds to a particular category of personnel,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
then we can highlight the following.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
In particular, professional competencies are primarily formed for specialists,

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
professional and administrative competencies for the administrative branch of the company,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
corporate competencies for all categories of personnel.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Personal competencies can be formed for all categories of personnel

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
and describe the requirements of the person-seeker,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
which will correspond to the subculture or microclimate of the structure branch,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
in which a specialist is selected.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
Lately, more and more often corporate competencies have been created in companies.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
Forming a competence model in a company begins with the formation of a corporate competence model.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Why does this happen?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
In a popular book by Jesper Kunde,

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
the author of this book, Jesper Kunde,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
applied the theory of Alfred Adler to business.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
He says that any company is perceived in three dimensions.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
The first is the mission, the way we want to be seen.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
The second is the brand, the way we are seen.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
And the third is the corporate religion, which is what we really are.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
In fact, this is influenced by three main aspects,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
or, as specialists say, three main aspects of the brand's success.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
The loyalty of the consumer, the loyalty of the partners and the loyalty of the company employees.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
According to the latest statistics,

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
the success of the candidates depends not only on their professional knowledge,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
skills, professional qualifications or professional competencies,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
but also on the corporate, personal characteristics,

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
which are primarily based on values and which must correspond to the corporate culture of the company.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
It is well known that the only conflict that is not resolved is a conflict at the value level.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
The concept of corporate competence allows the company to reduce the risk of hiring people

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
who do not correspond to the existing corporate culture and, as a result, do not fit into it.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Unfortunately, there are quite often situations in the market

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
when companies spend a decent amount of money on expensive specialists,

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
hire a HR agency, increase the financial costs for the purchase of such specialists,

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
having information that this specialist was quite successful in the ranks of a particular company.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
The specialist comes to the company and does not show the expected results from it.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Moreover, after a while, he leaves the company.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Why does this happen? For what reason?

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
Because when hiring, the company did not take into account the influence of the corporate culture

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
and did not assess the compatibility of a candidate with the corporate culture.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
That is, the company did not have such a concept as corporate competence.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
And one way or another, no attention was paid to this.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Therefore, the assessment of a candidate, first of all, with the presence of corporate competence,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
implies an assessment of his compatibility with the corporate culture.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
If the company does not have a model of competence,

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
in any form, and none, and there is no profile of the position,

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
then an application for the selection of a candidate is used to simplify the procedure of forming a requirement.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
How should the application for the selection of a candidate look like?

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
There are no common standards and requirements for the content of the application.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
As a rule, applications are formed independently,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
based on the goals that must be met and the planned results.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Either way, the time and the charm of time change with the other types of applications that exist in their bases.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Of course, in addition to the requirements for age and gender,

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
the application must contain a description of the tasks that the specialist will solve in the position he or she is assigned.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
In addition, it must describe the schedule of work,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
the degree of probability of business trips,

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
re-employment, as well as the conditions on which the applicant is invited.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Moreover, if the conditions will change as a result of the trial period,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
this should also be reflected in the application.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
The application must be filled out by the head of the structural unit,

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
because he knows how and what the employee will do in the vacancy position.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
In the case when the specialist has never faced the closure of such vacancies,

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
it is recommended to study the specifics.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
I want to give an example from my own work experience.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
At one time, my subordinate, a staff selection employee,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
was tasked with the closure of vacancies of the loss-management specialist.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
This is a position from the insurance market.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Until that moment, she had never faced this.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
What did she do?

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Actually, I was tasked with the closure of vacancies in such terms.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And the rest was on her shoulders.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
She approached this issue quite creatively.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
She called our loss-management specialists,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
asked them a number of questions,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
as a result of which it became clear to her the specifics of their work.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Actually, she went to see what they were doing,

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
and realized what these specialists have to face at work.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
Then, it was much easier for her to select a person for this position and this unit.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
The question is, where should we look for this staff?

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
There is an internal and an external selection.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
The search for candidates can also be conducted inside the company.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
Each of these options of selection has its pros and cons.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
The advantages of internal selection are, first of all,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
that the presence of internal selection of the company

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
allows to keep the staff in the company.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
That is, the staff has a certain transparency,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
an understanding of where they can move,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
plans for development or so-called career routes.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
The presence of internal selection improves the microclimate in the team,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
increases their morale and morale.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
That is, the staff understands that with high-quality work

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
they can get promotion and move up the career ladder.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
This increases motivation and, first of all, loyalty to the company,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
which is quite important lately.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
Also, the evaluation procedure allows to evaluate internal candidates.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
In addition to the fact that it is important for the business,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
it reduces costs.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
But internal selection also has its cons.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
In fact, it can cause negative emotions for those candidates,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
those employees of the company,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
who, for one reason or another, are not involved in the process of rotation

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
or in the process of internal selection.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
In the absence of an external staff reserve,

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
a part of the work, from which the employee rotates, may be cut off.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
And thus there are risks of reducing efficiency and some financial losses.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
To avoid this, it is desirable that the company always has a staff reserve.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
A staff reserve of both internal and external specialists.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
That is, a staff base, a resume of those investigators

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
who interviewed at a certain time for a certain position.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
External selection.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
The selection process, focused on external sources of search for work,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
has the following advantages.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
First of all, it allows to bring fresh blood and new ideas to the company.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
It gives the opportunity to get information about the situation on the market.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
It is also a way to form a positive image of the employer.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Provided that the quality of selection and the level of professionalism of employees is high enough

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
and everyone who comes, even those who have not yet joined the company,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
brings positive information about the company.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Sometimes this allows to minimize financial and time costs,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
since the procedure of retraining and training of employees,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
can be costly and long.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
External selection also has both advantages and disadvantages.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
First of all, it is difficult to adapt to the corporate culture.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
The duration.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Everyone knows that the period of adaptation is from 1 to 3 months.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
On average, this is 3 months.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
The leading link can be up to 6 months.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Sometimes it can be a year.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Also, there is a decrease in productivity during the adaptation period.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
In addition, there are additional costs for attracting company employees as mentors.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
If during the adaptation period employees are attracted to the company,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
who are mentors,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
and if this is not their functional duty,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
which they do one way or another,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
of course,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
they are distracted by mentorship.

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
This leads to additional costs and a decrease in efficiency

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
in their main work.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
How to organize the selection process?

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
The selection procedure consists of the following stages.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
The search for candidates.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Various sources are used for this.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Then, the study of the resume.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Then, the invitation to an interview of candidates in accordance with the requirements.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Then, the initial interview with a staff specialist,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
if there is a staff service in the company.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Then, the staff specialist conducts an analysis of the interview.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
And those candidates who meet the requirements are invited to a second interview

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
with the head of the structural division.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
In companies of medium and small business,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
where there is no staff service,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
usually, there may not be a second interview.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Everything is limited to the initial interview,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
which is conducted by the head of the structural division.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
Then, the decision is made on the invitation of a candidate.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
If several employees participate in the selection procedure,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
then the decision is made collegially.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Then, the invitation to work is made and the workplace is prepared.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
Quite often, the procedure for selecting staff is formalized in a document.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
In addition, the selection procedure may be different for different categories of staff.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
I would divide the terms as a stream of recruiting

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
and selection of specialists, professionals and managers.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
If we talk about the recruitment procedure,

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
it is quite common in the companies of the FMCG market,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
in the financial sector, in the banking sector,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
in the sales of services.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
So, the recruitment procedure is usually used by the trade representatives,

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
insurance agents, operators, cashiers,

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
who are constantly in demand and, unfortunately,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
are quite active.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Despite the fact that Western specialists say that

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
the level of liquidity in this category of staff cannot exceed 25%,

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
unfortunately, in our companies, the number can be 100% or even 150%.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
Then, the main task of the specialist, who is engaged in stream recruiting,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
is, first of all, to minimize the time costs

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
and increase the efficiency of the specialists who are selected.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Then the procedure looks somewhat different.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
I would like to discuss the recruiting procedure of the trade representative.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
Usually, after the announcement is posted in any of the sources,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
we will talk about the sources a little later,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
the incoming call is made.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
The incoming call is made by a specialist in recruiting,

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
who gives some primary information about the vacancy

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
and asks a number of basic, simple questions to the candidate.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
If the answers of the specialist in recruiting are satisfied by the candidate,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
as well as the answers of the candidate to the selection specialist,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
he is invited to the primary interview.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
The primary interview is held in the department or in the department of personnel,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
where the investigator fills out a questionnaire.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
An interview is held.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
Then, maybe, the specialist has already made a decision about the invitation to work,

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
or sometimes the supervisor is invited to the secondary interview.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
The secondary interview is often planned as follows.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
Taking into account the supervisor's schedule,

25:12.000 --> 25:20.000
the interview is scheduled at the time when the supervisor is in the office

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
and can devote time to the investigator.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
To minimize costs, group interviews are often held,

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
as a result of which the candidates who will go to the secondary interview are determined.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
Sometimes the secondary interview is held in the same way, by a group method.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
As a result of this interview, a decision is made about the invitation to work.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Now let's talk about the sources of personnel selection.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
What are they?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Various channels can be used as sources.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
In particular, these are mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
This is the Internet, where vacancies are posted on the most popular sites.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Recommendations of company employees.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
We also often use the recommendations of colleagues from other companies.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Working with universities.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Providing information at the university, meeting and presentations with students.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Or working through the university's legal department.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Working with labor exchanges.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
And also recruiting and advertising leaflets.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
But this source is relevant only for a certain category of personnel.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
In particular, it works in regions.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
The selection of search channels depends on a number of criteria.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
In particular, the category of personnel, the region of search,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
the frequency of personnel requirements and the term of the vacancy.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
I would like to consider separately the purpose of the use of a particular source,

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
depending on the category of personnel and the region.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
For example, such a source as the Internet.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
It is well known that in large cities, in particular in the Moscow metropolis,

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
one of the most actively used sources of selection is the Internet.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
Depending on the category of personnel, certain portals are used.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
But in the regions, the Internet is not so popular.

27:23.000 --> 27:32.000
Even in St. Petersburg, the Internet is less used and less effective source of personnel selection.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
Only recently, search engines from regions have become active,

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
partly due to the presence of certain Internet portals.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
Newspapers also depend on the category of personnel.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
If we talk about the lower category of personnel,

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
it is natural that they are usually searched through newspapers and magazines.

27:55.000 --> 28:03.000
It is difficult to find a cleaner, a driver, a guard in the Internet portals.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
As a rule, they are searched through newspapers and magazines.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
It is as stupid to search for managers through newspapers and magazines,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
if we talk about Moscow.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
They are usually searched through Internet portals.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
In the regions, the situation, as I said, can be exactly the opposite.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
In the regions, in particular, a good manager can be found,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
including through newspapers and magazines.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
But the most effective source in the regions,

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
based on my experience and statistics,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
is television.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
It is a running line.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
In some regions, particularly in the southern regions,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
northern regions and partly in the central regions,

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
it is one of the most in demand and most effective.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Employment centers.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
This source, according to my experience, does not work very well.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
Although, if we talk about hiring personnel for some urgent work,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
for partial employment,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
then here, of course, you can find certain specialists.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
As a rule, through employment centers you can find quite cheap specialists,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
but from the point of view of qualification, from the point of view of professional experience.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
It is almost impossible to find managers through employment centers.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Employee recommendations.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
According to my experience, in particular, if we talk about sales personnel,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
insurance agents,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
this is one of the most effective sources.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Another thing is that such factors affect the effectiveness of this source

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
as the degree of loyalty of the personnel.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
If the personnel is loyal, he loves the company,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
then he will act according to the principle

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
you will not wish yourself any harm.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Also, according to the same principle,

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
if the head of the structural unit is looking for an employee

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
and actually recommends him to the personnel service.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Again, if this is not the case,

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
when the head of the structural unit himself is engaged in the selection in the company.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
In addition, another source is the work with universities.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
The trend of the last day is the activation of interaction with universities.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Why is this happening?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Because there are a number of specialties,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
and there is a clear lack of specialists.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Not because there are few of them, but because there are simply no.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
That is why it is becoming relevant to interact with universities

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
and to grow the future personnel from the student bench.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
In companies, a whole program of interaction with universities is formed.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
Then employees begin to learn about the company,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
begin to come to internships,

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
to interact with the company at the stage of learning.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
If earlier this interaction began at the 4th, 5th year,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
or even closer to the diploma,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
then at the moment, more and more often

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
companies begin to interact with their future potential employees,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
starting from the 1st year, from the 2nd.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Another source that I would like to talk about separately is the HR.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
This is an external source.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
Attracting HR to selection is actually transferring the selection function to outsourcing.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
This source, like other sources, has its pros and cons.

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
In particular, the advantage of HR is the presence of regional representatives of HR,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
if there are any,

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
in the absence of branches and representatives of the company.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
Unfortunately, the disadvantage is the decrease in the quality of the selected specialists.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
In order to improve the effectiveness of interaction with HR

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
and the quality of the applicants,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
it is necessary to form clear criteria for choosing a particular HR agency.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
In fact, at the moment, what is the situation like?

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Due to the fact that there are quite a lot of HR agencies,

32:19.000 --> 32:27.000
there is no mandatory payment or advance

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
before the start of the search for candidates,

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
employers go by the principle of engaging in a fight, and then we'll see.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
They start to conclude agreements with various HR agencies.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
Who will offer them faster, who will offer them better?

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
And in the process of this work, we'll see who wins.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
So what happens next?

32:52.000 --> 33:00.000
Unfortunately, there are not so many highly qualified HR agencies that have their own databases.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
Moreover, there are agencies that have databases, but do not work with them.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
What do I mean by working with databases?

33:09.000 --> 33:17.000
They do not track the professional life of their potential candidates,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
who can be recommended in the company.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
They do not specify and do not know what is happening with them,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
where they work now,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
if they have a need to find a new employer.

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
And as a rule, they use the same Internet, which is used by internal specialists.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
What happens next?

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
A candidate is called with offers of the same vacancy to completely different HR agencies.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
In addition, an internal specialist can call him in the same way.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Because when a vacancy is given to an external counter,

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
it does not mean that the internal forces do not continue the search.

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
In fact, this does not cause anything positive for the candidate.

34:06.000 --> 34:16.000
As a rule, this causes irritation and a rather negative attitude towards the company and the potential employer.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
This sometimes serves as a solution to refuse to interact with this employer.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
And so the employer can lose the right searcher for him.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
What criteria of the chosen HR agency should be used?

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
In particular, first of all, it is necessary to assess the terms of service.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
This is the cost of the service,

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
this is the service to replace the candidate who is not suitable,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and the term of the vacancy.

34:49.000 --> 34:58.000
The cost of HR agencies varies from 20-25% to 30% of the annual fee.

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
It is equal to one or two deposits.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.000
Much depends on the complexity of the vacancy and the category of personnel.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
HR agencies also take into account the employer himself.

35:15.000 --> 35:21.000
How successful is the brand company,

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
and, depending on this, how well it will build its price policy.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
The next criterion of the choice should be the territorial coverage of the agency,

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
that is, the presence of agencies, regional representatives or partners.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Also, the specialization of the agency or specialists who are engaged in the selection.

35:39.000 --> 35:47.000
It is important to specify what tool and selection techniques this agency uses.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
It is also very important to have the experience of implementing projects similar to yours.

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
And, of course, the experience of working in the field of your company.

36:01.000 --> 36:09.000
It is an ideal option when a company without such experience is ready to familiarize itself with the specifics of your company.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
In addition to the above, I would like to share my experience of cooperation with HR agencies.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
I cooperated with HR agencies as a searcher and as an employer.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
I can say that when I closed regional vacancies, I had successful projects.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
The situation was as follows.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
We had a structural division in the region.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
At the same time, the restructuring that took place in the company

36:33.000 --> 36:40.000
meant the creation of another structural division over the structural division in the region.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
It is clear that the search for a higher structural division leader

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
could not be carried out by the forces of the employees of the existing structural division, the existing branch.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
Therefore, we connected HR agencies to this.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
I chose the Moscow HR agency, which had regional representatives.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
I can say that the quality of work pleased me.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
I will not name HR agencies, it is quite well known.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
What I liked and like about this HR agency is that they are narrowly specialized.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
They have specialists in certain areas.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Moreover, these specialists are not just in areas,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
they also know the specifics of a particular business very well.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
They know very well, in particular, in the regions,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
the key specialists of this business.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Especially when it comes to the management link.

37:31.000 --> 37:38.000
They collect recommendations not only from employees,

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
but also collect this information in the region.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
Due to the fact that the regional specifics are such that everyone knows another,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
and the world is full of rumors,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
it is difficult to collect information about a particular candidate.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
At the same time, the desire of the HR agency is to do this.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
My guys did it, and they did it quite successfully.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Thanks to them, a number of vacancies were closed.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
I have experience of negative interaction with HR agencies.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
This HR agency was not Moscow, it was regional.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
The game was chosen before I came to the position of HR director.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
What did I face?

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I faced the fact that the conditions in the contract were very specific.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
They were exclusively in favor of HR agencies.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
The fact that the management, that is, the general director and deputy general director,

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
who did not have a profile education related to personnel,

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
had no idea of what exists on the market, what are the conditions for interaction.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
They chose a few years ago.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I don't know by what criteria,

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
but due to the circumstances,

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
this HR agency worked quite well.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
It selected specialists.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
But then the situation on the market was different.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
It was not in Moscow, it was in another city.

39:17.000 --> 39:25.000
And then people went to this city, one of the administrative centers of the raw material region, with pleasure.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
Because the salary in this city was much higher than in the cities from which they were invited.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
But time has changed, years have passed.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
And, in fact, the situation on the labor market has changed.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
The situation, including the regional markets, and the level of wages in the regional markets,

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
has grown and has become in line with the administrative center where employees were invited.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
Then the question of improving the quality arose.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
But what did the HR agency do?

39:56.000 --> 40:03.000
The HR agency introduced a mandatory payment for the review of the resume.

40:04.000 --> 40:11.000
Therefore, the employer paid about 50% of the amount.

40:11.000 --> 40:22.000
I said that the cost of the HR agency's work is 20-25% of the average annual salary of a potential employee.

40:22.000 --> 40:31.000
Hypothetically, the amount of the payment of the HR agency's work according to the contract is 100,000 rubles.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
According to the contract, the employer had to pay about 50,000 rubles only for the review of the resume.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
At the same time, the HR agency did not take any obligations on itself.

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
That is, if suddenly the employer does not choose any of the proposed resumes,

40:51.000 --> 40:59.000
then the same 50,000 rubles remain in the pocket of the HR agency for this investigator.

41:00.000 --> 41:10.000
This was certainly a situation when the HR agency took advantage of the lack of knowledge and professionalism of the company's leading link.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
It is clear that there is no need to talk about any partnership relations in such a situation.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
I happily parted with this HR agency.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
I had to go to regional selection, that is, to go to regions,

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
because they still selected people for us from other regions.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
I came there, I met people, had an interview,

41:38.000 --> 41:47.000
and in the process of the interview I realized that people were initially misled not only about the functionality that they had to perform,

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
but also about the salary that the employer can pay.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
Initially, potential investigators were deceived.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
At the same time, I went on a business trip, I spent the company's money on a flight, on accommodation.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
Unfortunately, this was not provided in the contract.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
In this situation, in the situation of misleading potential investigators,

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
that is, providing investigators with incorrect information, the HR agency was responsible.

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
In particular, this is the situation with a non-qualified and non-partnership HR agency.

42:30.000 --> 42:38.000
I also think that it is very important to produce statistics and analysis of the effectiveness of the personnel search sources.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
After all, the question is not only in the selection of search sources, but in the fact that these sources were effective.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
How can you determine the effectiveness of sources?

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
I want to offer you some criteria on which I have formed my statistics,

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
and on the basis of which I made decisions about how effective or ineffective a certain source is.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
In particular, the scheme was as follows.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
This is a kind of filter.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
This is the number of incoming calls, separately for each of the working sources.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
This is when it comes to the flow in the sea of ​​the circle, and the searchers themselves call.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The number of interviews recorded.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
This is also for recruiting, for flow, when the searchers call and record.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Further. The number of interviews.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
The number of interviews sent to the secondary interview.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
The number of interviews sent to the secondary interview.

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
I would also like to focus on the number of interviews.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
There is a tendency, which I noticed, that some categories of personnel,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
in particular, not only from the block of flow recruiting,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
for example, this tendency exists among secretaries.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
There were quite often situations when secretaries were invited to an interview,

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
they wrote down, they agreed to come to the interview, and then they just did not come to it.

44:00.000 --> 44:06.000
I have encountered this, including with specialists in the personnel department.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
With drivers.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
And, perhaps, probably, yes, by the way, with system administrators.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Such an interesting story.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
This is my experience, which may be useful and interesting to you.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
Therefore, I think it will not be superfluous to assess the effectiveness.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
Did the searcher come to the interview or not?

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
Of course, of course, here you also need to divide it into categories of personnel.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
The next assessment position is the number of people who went to work.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Further. The number of people left after the probation period.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
This is very relevant, including for those searchers who come to us on the recommendation of the HR agency.

44:52.000 --> 44:59.000
Also for HR agencies, I would include such a point as the frequency of replacement of candidates.

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
As a rule, in contracts with HR agencies, only one-time replacement is designated.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
But if you have been working with HR for a long time and in a number of positions,

45:10.000 --> 45:17.000
it will not be superfluous to look at how often this replacement occurs, including in what categories of personnel.

45:17.000 --> 45:27.000
It seems to me that such a very long-term assessment of the quality of the source is the duration of work in the company.

45:27.000 --> 45:37.000
The longer a person in the company who came to us from a particular source works, the more effective he is.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
The next block is the collection and analysis of information about the candidate.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
At this stage, the information about the candidates is studied, which is provided in the form of a summary.

45:49.000 --> 46:00.000
The selection specialist will make a primary selection of the candidate and look at the requirements that are formed in the application.

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
In medium and small companies, as we said, this function is usually performed by the head of the structural divisions.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
That is, they make this primary selection of the resume on their own.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
And now a few words about the primary interview.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
The purpose of a primary interview is, first of all, to exchange information.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
At this stage, you can call on people to look and show yourself.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
Here, not only acquaintance with the candidate, his experience, personal qualities,

46:26.000 --> 46:36.000
but also presentation of information about the company, acquaintance with the staff and features of work within this company.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
In the case of a stream recruiting, as a rule, primary interviews are sometimes limited.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
Sometimes a group interview is held for this category.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I have already talked a little about this.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Also, at this stage, the candidate fills out a typical questionnaire.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
Sometimes the company develops several forms of such questionnaires for various categories of staff.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
What is this related to?

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
As a rule, the higher the qualification of the specialist, the more complete his resume.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
The information is clearly structured and in many ways.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
In some companies, there are situations when they ask to write an autobiography.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
This is much less common.

47:20.000 --> 47:27.000
Because, one way or another, at the moment, both searchers and selection specialists

47:27.000 --> 47:33.000
try to use their working time as efficiently as possible

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
and get the maximum information from the resume or receive it before the primary interview.

47:39.000 --> 47:48.000
In addition, if there is a greater need in the staff, as a rule, it is necessary to close several vacancies at the same time.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
And then the time resource becomes even more limited.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
It becomes one of the most valuable resources.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
By the way, this is a resource that cannot be fulfilled in any way.

47:59.000 --> 48:07.000
Here, most often, and most relevant for the selection specialist and those who are engaged in selection,

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
is the planning of their actions at each stage of the selection procedure.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
I want to repeat once again that time is the only resource that cannot be fulfilled.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
It must be saved.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
What are the selection methods?

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
In particular, one of the selection methods or one of the methods of selection is the use of diagnostic tests.

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
If these tests are used, then there is another additional stage,

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
where, one way or another, diagnostic testing is carried out.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
The tests are different.

48:42.000 --> 48:49.000
In particular, the personality surveyors, MMPI, or the so-called SMIL, which is adapted by SOPCHEK,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
it is called, it is decoded, the standard method of personality research.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
The Aizinko surveyor, Kittel, general abilities test, imitation test.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Specialists believe that imitation tests are the most effective,

49:04.000 --> 49:16.000
because they simulate specific situations or simulate situations similar to those that the searcher will decide at his workplace.

49:17.000 --> 49:25.000
But again, the question is the goals and results that we want to achieve using the diagnostic tests.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
In my opinion, there are certain risks of using diagnostic tests.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.000
Due to the fact that I have a second psychological education and additional areas of psychodiagnostics,

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
and, among other things, I was trained by diagnostic tests,

49:42.000 --> 49:49.000
my attitude to the use of diagnostic tests is very ambiguous and, I would even say, very skeptical.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Why? I can explain.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.000
In particular, one of the most valid diagnostic tests, the standard method of personality research,

49:59.000 --> 50:07.000
consists of 500 questions, and the completion of this test requires 1.5-2 hours from the searcher.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
2. In order to process and interpret it, you need to have psychological education,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
and, secondly, additional areas of psychodiagnostics.

50:18.000 --> 50:27.000
But, in any case, the quality of the interpretation of a particular test depends on the objectivity of a particular piece of information.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
Once I was in a very interesting situation, which I observed in one of the Ukrainian companies,

50:32.000 --> 50:39.000
when the specialists in the selection of personnel used the test of Lyudmila Nikolaevna Sobchik,

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
an individual typological surveyor, which was developed by her.

50:42.000 --> 50:51.000
I saw how they gave feedback on the results of the interpretation of this test by the searcher.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Let's start with the fact that these specialists did not have any psychological education,

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
especially since they had additional psychodiagnostic education.

50:59.000 --> 51:06.000
It was like people actually assert themselves at the expense of the searchers.

51:06.000 --> 51:13.000
It seems to me that this is unacceptable, and no professional ethics allows this.

51:13.000 --> 51:20.000
I would also like to say separately about the tests of intellectual abilities, in particular, the test of the same Kittel.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
Due to the fact that the specialists continue to argue what the intellect is and what it consists of,

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
there is also a certain subjectivism in the assessment and perception.

51:34.000 --> 51:44.000
In particular, during the Kittel test, I faced certain questions in my head.

51:44.000 --> 51:56.000
When a person will answer questions about composers, he may not know Prokofiev, but know Sibelius.

51:56.000 --> 52:03.000
He may not know anything about pistils and stamens, but at the same time understand quantum physics.

52:03.000 --> 52:12.000
So, in fact, whether he has an intellect or not, the specialists still continue to argue.

52:12.000 --> 52:21.000
Therefore, I want to return to the question of whether it is worth using, the question of goals and the results you want to get.

52:22.000 --> 52:31.000
Unfortunately, I have faced situations when people were refused to work on the results of psychological testing.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Among other things, in Russia, this is a violation of the labor code.

52:36.000 --> 52:44.000
In particular, the use of such a test as the 8-color test or the 32-color test of Le Cher at work,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
in my opinion, looks ridiculous.

52:47.000 --> 52:58.000
Because the psycho-diagnostic test of Le Cher reflects the momentary emotional state of a person at this moment.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
And does not say anything else.

53:01.000 --> 53:09.000
In addition, psychologists, when using the Kittel tests, they use not one test, but a selection of tests.

53:10.000 --> 53:17.000
Among other things, they never judge the structure of a person's personality and personal characteristics,

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
even after the interpretation and selection of tests.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
They always look at the dynamics.

53:25.000 --> 53:35.000
Therefore, dear selection specialists and company employees who conduct interviews.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
Of course, this is my opinion and my position.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
The position of a person with a psychological education and an additional psycho-diagnostic.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
But of course, it is up to you to decide.

53:47.000 --> 53:54.000
I just want to return to the question of goals and the results you want to get.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
One of the methods of selection is the group method.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
It is used when it is possible to collect a number of candidates together.

54:04.000 --> 54:13.000
In addition, the specialist who conducts the group interview is qualified enough to evaluate each candidate

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
during the use of various assessment procedures.

54:16.000 --> 54:23.000
Now, the Assessment Center is used quite actively as a group method of selection.

54:23.000 --> 54:31.000
In companies with a competence model, this method is used more often and shows good results.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
It is quite effective.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
A little bit about the group method of selection.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
The group method of selection is when several candidates are gathered for the same vacant position.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
They are given individual tasks, and the same ones.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Group tasks, cases, which they decide.

54:54.000 --> 55:02.000
And, in fact, the specialists evaluate how they solve these or those tasks.

55:02.000 --> 55:11.000
I repeat, the Assessment Center is designed to evaluate the quality of candidates

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
or the quality of the compliance of a particular candidate to the position.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
In the current experience, the Assessment Center is used not as a selection procedure,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
but as a procedure of assessment of the existing staff.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
But more and more often companies turn to the assessment method,

55:32.000 --> 55:41.000
including the group method of assessment and selection at the stage of selection of staff.

55:41.000 --> 55:51.000
When the candidate has already passed several stages of the selection procedure,

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
he reaches the key moment when the decision is made

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
on whether to take him or not to work, and on the compliance or non-compliance of the position.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
This is practically the culmination of the whole action.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
The decision should be made, first of all, logically and collegially.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
If several employees took part in the selection procedure,

56:14.000 --> 56:22.000
it is necessary to collect as much information as possible from all participants of the selection procedure.

56:22.000 --> 56:29.000
To increase the efficiency of decision-making, it is necessary to introduce a system of candidate assessment.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
The characteristics of the assessment system can be as follows.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
First of all, it should be based on objective information and give objective assessments of the candidate.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
It is clear that we are all subjective, so we can talk about objectivity only when a system of criteria is formed,

56:48.000 --> 56:55.000
which will allow us to objectively assess a candidate.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
When we will do it based on the criteria system, and not on the basis of our own intuition.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
In fact, the assessment system, among other things, should help employees involved in the process

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
to achieve better understanding when making a collegial decision.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
And it should be a continuation of the policy in the field of staff management.

57:19.000 --> 57:26.000
Key requirements of the relevant position are often taken as a basis for the assessment system.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
The statements of candidates are assessed in points.

57:29.000 --> 57:35.000
For example, the points can be on a five-point scale.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
From 1 to 5 is excellent.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
This scale has been known to us since ancient times, since our school bench.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
But in order to avoid the risk of information distortion,

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
it is important to clearly specify and determine what we mean by bad, good, satisfactory, excellent.

57:59.000 --> 58:06.000
You can see the example of the candidate assessment in your textbook.

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
The decision on the appointment of a candidate for work is accepted.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
What's next?

58:13.000 --> 58:23.000
One of the last agreements before coming to work is the application for an invitation or the so-called job offer.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
The practice of applying for a job offer came to our lives not so long ago.

58:28.000 --> 58:37.000
Most often, an invitation to work is written and contains the following points.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
First of all, this is a detailed description of the position, the name of the position,

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
functional tasks, subordination, working conditions,

58:46.000 --> 58:54.000
working day, possible business trips, possible retraining, payment conditions,

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
payment, variable part, that is, bonuses, and social package.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
This is a detailed description of what is included in the social package.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
The duration of the probation period and the conditions for the probation period.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
In addition, if the size of the reward changes according to the results of the probation period,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
it is also described in the job offer.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
And, among other things, the date of the job offer.

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
The job offer is signed by the employer and sent to the solicitor.

59:30.000 --> 59:36.000
Sometimes two parties ask to sign this job offer.

59:36.000 --> 59:43.000
That is, the employer and the solicitor who agrees to the conditions on which he is invited.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
And the last step is the preparation of the workplace.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
What should be prepared?

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
First of all, it would be ideal if the worker on the table on the first day had a greeting.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Greetings and a wish for good luck to work in a new place.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
A computer.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I can say that this is also very relevant, because at one time I personally faced a situation

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
when I waited for a computer for a month and a half.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
It's good that I had my laptop and I worked for a month and a half with my laptop.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
But such an approach is unacceptable.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Visiting cards, if this implies a status of a position.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Access to the corporate network.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
A good pen, preferably with the company logo.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
If the company has a formalized employee code,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
then, of course, it should also be on the table.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And the employee on the first day should be introduced to the staff.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And, of course, it's even better and more ideal

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
when employees send information about the new employee's departure.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And it is desirable that they do it either in the morning when he just left,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
or before he went to work, and not a few days after his arrival.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
In conclusion, I would like to talk about certain trends in the labor market.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000
In modern conditions, a huge number of employers have faced the problem of staff hunger.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
There are several reasons for this situation.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
On the one hand, the increasing pace of economic growth,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and on the other hand, the consequences of the demographic crisis that occurred in the 90s.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
At the moment, employers, like selection specialists,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
reap the fruits of these successes.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
The situation looks like this.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
According to the proposals, employers exceed the number of staff resources.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
The biggest problems are, of course, the regional markets.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
If Moscow and a number of large cities are replenished from regions,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
then there is absolutely no way to fill this staff hunger.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
That is why the best staff flows to large cities,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
first of all to Moscow and St. Petersburg.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The company is increasingly addressing the concept of an attractive employer.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
But what is behind this concept?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Unfortunately, not everyone knows.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
How to shape the image of an attractive employer?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And not only in the eyes of the researchers, but also of the staff.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Because when a company is in a bad situation,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
it is difficult to find a good employer.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The main goal is not only to attract new staff,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
but also to maintain the existing staff.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The company's loyal staff should be formed.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
What should be the formalized and implemented measures outside the company

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to attract the right specialist,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and what should be the formalized and implemented measures inside the company

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
to maintain the existing staff and to form its loyalty?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
As I said, the loyalty of the staff is also important.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And there is a real struggle for the personnel and for the talent.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Unfortunately, the trends of recent years do not give hope.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The average working experience of employees in Moscow companies

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
has decreased to a year and a half.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
By the way, some time ago this figure was from 2 to 3 years.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
The situation is clearly deteriorating.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
If we talk to our Western colleagues and Western specialists,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
they prove that an employee becomes as efficient as possible

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
for the second or third year of working in a company.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And now let's look at the duration of the employees' work in Moscow companies.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Most employees do not finish their work until they reach their maximum efficiency.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
The brand of an attractive employer is a component of the brand of the company

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
and its integral component.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
What is a brand?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
A brand is not a fashionable thing or a magic wand

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
that can solve all your problems.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
It should be an effective tool for the development of the business,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
a means of protection from competitors,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and, among other things,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000
a way to attract new, fresh people to you and retain the old ones.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
The brand should be effective.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It's not only a brand,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
but also a tool for external consumers and staff.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
What is the key to create a positive brand of an employer?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
First of all, the formation of a positive image in the labor market

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
gives a huge reduction in costs for attracting staff.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Because there are a number of extremely effective ways to retain employees

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
who understand that it is better not to leave such a good company,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
and to attract new people.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Also, a positive image of the company, as well as of the employer,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
increases the degree of loyalty of the staff,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and the loyalty of the company to the employees.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Especially if these goals are formalized and conveyed to the employees.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And, of course, a good image in the labor market

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
improves all possible marketing communications,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
which leads to the growth of the profitability of the business as a whole.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I would like to remind you once again about Jesper Kunde

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and the theory of Alfred Adler.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The image of an attractive employer is, on the one hand, a brand,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
that is, it is partially two-legged,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
one foot in the concept of a brand,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and on the other hand, in the concept of a corporate religion.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
In psychology, there is such a term as congruence.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
This is the correspondence of all elements that affect the perception.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
If any of the elements does not correspond to the other,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
the picture of the world does not coincide,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
it undoubtedly affects the perception, image,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and, as a result, the reputation of the company.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It is difficult to imagine a situation

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
when the company has an attractive reputation in the external context,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
while the degree of satisfaction of the staff inside is zero.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The same is true of the situation with the opposite accuracy.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
When people are happy, happy, loyal inside the company,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
and the searchers only receive negative information about their potential employer.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
This is unlikely to happen.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
As a rule, everything should be congruent, and this is how it happens.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The image of an attractive employer in the external context,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
as well as the loyalty of the employees,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
is a link in one chain.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
It is impossible to solve only one task.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
To set a goal in front of you,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
to form an image of an attractive employer,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
you need to remember that you need to solve it in a complex way.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Perhaps, it is necessary to start with the following,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
to determine what the concept of the image of an attractive employer includes.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
What is it?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
What does it consist of?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Each company has its own idea of the components of the image of an attractive employer.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
By conducting business trainings with a management link,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
one way or another, we come to the topic of attractive employers

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000
and start thinking about what is the image of an attractive employer for a particular company.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
As my experience shows,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
the characteristics and criteria that we form

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
are usually very different.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Of course, there is something that matches,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
but there is something that does not match.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
From what matches,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I have formed certain factors,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
especially significant for the searchers,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
because I conducted such surveys for the searchers.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
So, what happened?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
What is attractive for the searcher?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The company should have competitive wages,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
corresponding to the market conditions,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
a social package and a transparent system of priming.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Transparent and understandable.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The principle of contribution-payment should be consistent and uniform for everyone.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
There should not be double standards in the company.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
There should not be subjectivism in this matter.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
The transparency of the company itself is an important factor,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
as a result of the existence of a white wage.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
The employer should keep promises given at the stage of the job invitation.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Employees also want to be respected.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They should be respected for their human dignity,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
considering it one of the most important resources of the company.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
For example, I can say that if we talk about the criteria of the employer's choice,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
the trend in the market, in particular in Moscow, has changed significantly.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
If some time ago, in the first lines,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
when the employers chose the searchers,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
they set the level of wage and career growth,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
then at the moment they set self-development,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
development within the company,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
not only career, but also professional,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and microclimate in the team.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Agree?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The situation has changed.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The level of wage is self-definition,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
but it is not the first priority.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Transparency is also important for the employees,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
not only in the payment system,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
but also in the perspective of their development within the company.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And the last thing I have already mentioned.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
A favorable microclimate.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
The team style of interaction is set by the searchers

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
as one of the first priorities.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It sounds sad for the employer,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
but the market is behind the searchers today.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
The right specialist can be lost at the selection stage.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
What are the dangers of losing the best of the best?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
First.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Too long waiting for the sent resume.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Unpresentable appearance of the person conducting the interview

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and the bad condition of the room in which this interview is held.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Poor preparation for the interview.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Incorrect behavior of the interviewer

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and non-stop phone calls.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
When he conducts the interview, of course.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
In conclusion, I would like to say

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that it is necessary to remember

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
that not only the front office employees,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
who interact with the clients,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
but also the specialists who participate in the selection of the staff

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
are the tool for the formation of a positive image of the company,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
which means the creation of a brand.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
The impression of the searchers depends on their professionalism.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
As a result of this impression,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
the searchers make decisions

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
about the acceptance of the offer from a potential employer.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
It is also important to remember

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that the most effective advertising is the radio.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
According to statistics, we transmit information to 10-15 people.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And those people are following the chain.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It is not difficult to read the result.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And then, the money invested in advertising

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
of the brand, in promoting it on the market,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
will not contribute to the creation of a positive brand of the employer.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
That is why it is important to remember

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
that the employees involved in the selection procedure

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
should not only conduct a qualitative and professional selection,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
hire employees,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
but also part with the staff.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Interview

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Among the selection methods,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
the interview takes a special position.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The interview is the central element

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and is used most widely in the selection.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
The interview allows you to assess a wide range of qualities

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
necessary for work in the supposed position.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The procedure of conducting the interview and the selection criteria

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
should be clear and transparent

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
to reduce the level of subjective assessment.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You need to be prepared for the interview.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
When preparing for the interview,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
you need to use the information

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
that the candidate has told you in the resume.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
There are different types of interviews.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Interview, stress, monologue,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
hiding, partner and testing.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
We would like to show you the video cases

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
of the types of interviews.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Hello.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Please, take a seat.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
My name is Polina.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I am the head of the Department of Personnel Management.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I will tell you about our company,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
how long we have been in the market.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
We have been in the market for about 15 years.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
We are developing actively.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
We started out as a small family-type company.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
About 5 years ago we rebranded.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
This was the result of merging with a large Western company.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We have formalized all standards,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
in particular corporate culture,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
internal business ethics,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
telephone communication standards.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
We have a certain requirement

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
regarding the appearance of our employees.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Our management gives great importance

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
to people being loyal,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
working in the company for a long time.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
One of the corporate competences of our company

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
is loyalty,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
support for all innovation changes

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
that occur in the company.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The company is actively developing.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
This is also one of the corporate competences.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Moreover, you know,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
we have a great importance

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
for the creativity of our employees.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
One way or another,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
we develop innovation from the bottom up.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
We took the basis of technology

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
that was implemented by Walt Disney.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We have many innovations

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
that are implemented by working groups.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
One of them is called Creative.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
The next group is called Criticans.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The third group is called Realizers.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Our managers love to look at the West.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
We have certain rules

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
for creating a positive mindset.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Before the start of the working day,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
we watch cartoons.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
You know, Walt Disney cartoons.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
By the way, we have standards

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
in the corporate literature,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
corporate movies.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I can say that one of the corporate books

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
is Alice in Wonderland.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
It is a very informative book.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Our management believes

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
that by reading children's books,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
our employees can not only improve

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
their positive level,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
but also learn many useful

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and interesting things.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
By the way, there is a Soviet cartoon

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
that also allows to create a positive mindset.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Imagine, Vitaly,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
a cartoon called The Little Raccoon.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I totally agree with you.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It is a wonderful cartoon.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
It is also a corporate cartoon.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Our employees watch it in the morning

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
before the start of the working day.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Besides Walt Disney cartoons,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
they also watch cartoons about the Little Raccoon.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It is not only a part of the corporate standards.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It is one of the core standards.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Our CEO is a very ambitious young man.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He started from scratch.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
He joined this company 15 years ago.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
He was a simple salesman.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Now he is the CEO.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
He brought our company to this level.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
He created our corporate standards.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
By the way, Vitaly,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
how do you like our vacancy?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You know, you need to take a time-out,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
think about it, and maybe…

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Don't you like it?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
You know, it is…

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You need to think about it,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
and agree with your employer.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You know, it is a very important position in our company.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
This position has great powers.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Our company welcomes creativity.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You, as the head of this department,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
can realize all your potential.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
You know, we can involve you in other innovative projects,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
develop other areas.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
We have a lot of opportunities for people

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
who want to develop themselves.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
You know, the Moslov Pyramid?

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Those who are on the top floor of the Moslov Pyramid

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
are our most valuable personnel.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Based on your resume,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I realized that you are the person

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
we need.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Good afternoon, Vitaly.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
We received your resume,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and, thank God, we met today.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So, you know,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
we are a well-known international

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
clinic company.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And after reading your resume,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
we saw that you have enough experience.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
You know,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you will have to manage the claims department

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
in your position,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and your department will work with VIP-clients.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Let's look at the situation.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
We are in a long-term relationship with the project,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
so, we are responsible for the claims,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and we received the claims.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
So, the client is not ready to pay

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
our services in the time set in the schedule.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
In this situation,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
imagine that you have to write a letter

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
to this VIP-client,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
with apologies and an excuse

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000
to get the payment in accordance with the schedule.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Please, leave this letter.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
May I have a pen and a piece of paper?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yes, of course.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
You know,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
you have a lot of graphical errors,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and you are very strict with the client.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Okay, let's imagine another situation.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Your employee did not send the letter to the client

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
in time to receive the claim.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Of course, the client was not satisfied with this,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
he turned to you.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
What did you do?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I mean, the client has not received the letter yet, right?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Yes.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
In this case,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I call or call,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
depending on the situation,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.000
this employee and make him finish his work.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
This is the first option.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
The second option,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
if there is such a…

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Well, if the work allows

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
to connect another employee,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
then I call him,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
ask him to study the client's dossier,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and, accordingly,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000
to finish the work that this employee could not do before.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You said that your experience as a manager is 5 years,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
before that you worked as a specialist for 2 years.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Tell me, please,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
what claims management projects you had at that time?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000
This is just a reduction of the number of claims.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You told about 50% reduction of claims.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
What specific measures did you propose for this?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I proposed a certain classification of all claims

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
on the places of their occurrence.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Was it a costly project for your company?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Well, initially, the investments, of course, were large.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But you understand that your area includes the solution of personnel issues.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yes.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
How do you see it?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I select the team for the tasks that I directly put.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
So, we are talking with you about the goals that you put in the project.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Please, write down how you will cascade these goals

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
for each participant of your team.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Please.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It is clear that there may be other options.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Yes, of course.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
This is what…

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
You have distributed the roles,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
and what are the indicators of their effectiveness?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Of course, they are determined by the process in which they are involved.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Each process has its own goal, its own result.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Well, for today, I want to say thank you very much for your visit.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I will definitely contact you,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
probably within a week or a week and a half.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And then there will be the next stage of the interview.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Thank you.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Thank you very much.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Good afternoon, Vitaly.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
My name is Elena Samoylova.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I am the Director of Personnel at the company MedService.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Nice to meet you.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I am glad to welcome you to our company.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I would like to suggest that we will build our interview in the following way.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
First, we will talk about your experience, your resume, and, accordingly, your education.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000
After that, I will tell you a little about the company and the tasks that are presented to the candidates.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
After that, you can ask your questions and we can discuss our future prospects.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I am satisfied with your plan.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Okay, good.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It would be very important for our company to know what your experience was at the previous place of your work.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
In general, I have been working in this area for about 7 years.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Not about 7 years, but 7 years.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And for 2 years I worked as a specialist,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and for 5 years I worked as a head of the department.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Okay, and how many people were subordinate to your department?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
5 people.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.000
You understand that this department cannot be large, but it is quite specifically complex in management.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Vitaly, please tell us what was your most complex project in the area of claim resolution?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
This project was at the last place of work.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
We were producing doors then.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
The doors were quite expensive, the delivery dates were violated,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and the client was not given a fully equipped door.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
He was extremely dissatisfied.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
For three days we had quite tough negotiations with him.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I managed to reach an agreement with him on mutually acceptable conditions for continuing cooperation.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
How often did your company have complaints?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
In the company, there were quite a lot of complaints in recent years,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:48.000
but I managed to reduce them by about 50% in the last 3 years.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
This is a very good indicator, in fact.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Okay, how can you characterize your main advantages?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.000
My advantage is the ability to work with conflict clients.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I know and understand the essence of conflicts, I know how to organize and solve them.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I would like to move a little closer to our company and say a few words.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Our company MedService is an international-level company,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
and this is a network of clinics for sufficiently wealthy clients.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The main task we set for the candidate to become the head of the claim department

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.000
is to manage the department itself and distribute the duties among the employees of this department.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
The second important task is to work with VIP clients.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Of course, sometimes these are quite difficult clients.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
But it is also independent work,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000
that is, not only the distribution of duties, but also independent work with these clients.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
At the same time, this is a timely consideration of claims

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and, accordingly, the solution of all organizational issues, both financial and personnel.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And the main task is to provide high-level services provided by VIP clients

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
and to satisfy the justified claims.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Okay, I understand.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I previously looked at the website of your company,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
so I am familiar with the types of activities it carries out.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Now you have pointed out to me in more detail the area that I will have to face.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I thank you, Vitaly, for visiting our company, for your interest in our company.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And I want to propose the following scheme.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Within three days we will consider your candidacy,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000
and after this period we will contact you and inform you about the results of the initial interview.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Elena, in turn, I would like to thank you very much for such a comfortable conversation

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
and a complete disclosure of information.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Good afternoon, Vitaly.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Good afternoon.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I am glad to see you.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You know, you are probably aware of our vacancy.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I looked through your CV.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
You have enough experience in working with claims.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yes.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And we expect that you, as a person who has the appropriate qualifications,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
will be able to cope with this task.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
You understand perfectly well that claims can be of a completely diverse nature.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Yes, I understand.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But at the same time, I need to look at where there are shortcomings, mistakes, in order to correct them.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And if such an exchange is not clear enough, how will I do it?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
That is, how should I communicate with the employees?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Look, everything is quite simple.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
In a specific situation, if necessary, you will be required to provide all the information to the corresponding employees

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
who participate or work with this client.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
In fact, the implementation of business processes is a fully formalized work.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
We understand what kind of work and services we are performing.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
The employees know perfectly well what to do and how.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
In the event of some kind of borderline situation, you receive all the information on the request.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And, of course, this issue will be controlled by the management.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
One of the managers will supervise all this work.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And to whom will I obey directly?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
You will obey one of the general managers of the company,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:46.000
depending on how your work will start at the time of joining the company.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Where is my workplace? Where should I work? How far should I go?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
We have several offices in the city.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And what is my position?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Depending on the direction, depending on who you will work with from your colleagues,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
we have places where to place employees, what to provide them with.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I would not even worry about this in your place.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And the number of subordinates?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
The number of subordinates will depend on what you will be working with.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000
We will discuss separately what you will do, where you will be useful to us,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
because we have options for applying such a manager.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Therefore, I think that based on the results of your abilities, we will decide how many people you will employ.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I have organizational abilities, I have the ability to work with a company.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yes, thank you, Vitaly. I noticed that you told me about your previous experience,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
about how you managed the group. I understand, I am quite clear.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Can you tell us more about your corporate culture?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
What are your main goals?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
You understand perfectly well that the specifics of our activities are assumed by a rather complex schedule of work.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Our mobile groups work according to a special schedule,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and we have a very strict schedule.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
We have a very strict schedule, and we have a very strict schedule.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
We have a very strict schedule, and we have a very strict schedule.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000
We have a very strict schedule, and we have a very strict schedule.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000
It all depends on how they interact with clients.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:46.000
There are departments that work on a very similar schedule to the standard working schedule.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
As for the holidays, it depends on the desire of the people.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
These or those events may occur periodically.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Well, Vitaly, maybe you have any more questions?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I have no more questions. Thank you.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Thank you, Vitaly. I understand your competences and your capabilities.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Thank you for coming to us.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:19.000
How can we cooperate in the future? How can I find out about my decision?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Well, you can call us later and find out the result.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Deal. Thank you.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Thank you.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I would like to start our interview with you telling us a little bit about yourself.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I have, in accordance with the requirements that you have presented in the open questionnaire format,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I have been working as a manager for 5 years.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Before that, I worked as a specialist for about 2 years in the client-related department.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So, Vitaly, did I understand correctly, based on your story,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.000
that you did not undergo any self-taught training in the field of staff management and management competences?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Not quite. The fact is that you did not pay attention to my resume,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
where I have listed a number of trainings on…

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You know, I paid attention, but I did not quite understand that…

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Apparently, your resume is made in such a way that it is not very clear

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
that this is just training in the field of management competences.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I have a degree in MBA, which answers this question quite specifically.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000
It includes skills of management competences of a manager, including HR management.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Please, give us some examples of how you used your knowledge gained in MBA.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
What did you use it for?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I have already said that I have 5 years of management experience in the field of work with claims.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:13.000
The staff I have worked with, I mean, managed, is about 20 people.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:21.000
It is a large holding, where I had to deal with all the most difficult situations,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
starting from the moment of organization of the department's activities

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
to the claims that my managers could not solve.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
All this had to be solved.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Please, tell us, what is your management experience useful and interesting to our company?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I believe that my skills and experience, according to the formal characteristics,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
which are announced in the vacancy and the resume that I sent you,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
they correspond to the skills of the department.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Please, tell us, what is the priority for you in the choice of the employer?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Comfortable work, which is in normal working conditions, plus payment.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:18.000
If you say that the priority for you, including the first one you mentioned, is comfortable work,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it means that you have missed our requirements, which were clearly defined as stress and stability.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000
The fact is that if I am stressed and stable, then for me it is a certain comfortable situation.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
It does not violate any other, does not contradict.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
That is, I understand correctly that in situations of pressure, pressure,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
in particular, in working with difficult clients, you are comfortable enough,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
as comfortable as with clients who are more laid-back.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
This is a normal situation, yes, I can handle it.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Okay, give an example of a situation, such stressful clients,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
which were pressuring you, and how did you manage to cope with it?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You know, there were different situations.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
In particular, I take a recent example.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.000
In that company, in the previous experience, I will give you.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
The company was engaged in the installation of doors.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Accordingly, very often there were complaints about the issue of accessories.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
As you understand, the price of the door is quite high,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.000
and people who are able to order such a set, especially in an elite apartment,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
where there are quite a lot of openings, these are very specific people,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
who can be threatened, who can be used in one way or another administratively.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
What did you do in this situation?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000
In particular, I applied what is called active listening.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:05.000
In order to reduce the aggression that the client shows,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
you need to listen to him first.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I showed him that I hear him, I am on his side.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I did not promise him to solve all the problems that exist.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Tell me, if the client is so aggressive that he is capable of some inadequate actions,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
then most of the clients you describe are quite capable of such actions.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
The security service is obliged to monitor the aggressiveness of the behavior of visitors.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000
You said that the security service should somehow react to this.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Your actions are obligatory.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
We have a law.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
You will not explain to a client who is quite aggressive,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000
is in an emotional re-energization, that he must comply with the law,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and thus you will make him even more angry.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You misunderstood me. Let's clarify a number of questions.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Vitaly, you yourself tried to say that the clients have very different,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
some of them are even inadequate.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Inadequacy should not go beyond the law.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Of course, I am not an expert in who buys armored doors,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000
but probably you did not convey this to me in the right words.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Okay, Vitaly, I think that according to the results of our conversation,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
you are not very suitable for us,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
that is, you do not quite meet the requirements that we propose to these candidates.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Can you clarify what are the reasons?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
In particular, stress resistance.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Do you think that I got out of my comfort zone?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Dynamics.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
What did you not like about the dynamics of my answers?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Sometimes you need to react to a situation much faster than you do.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
What do you mean by dynamics?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I mean exactly what I said.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The fact is that making decisions and talking are two different things.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
You have not yet conducted an experiment on…

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I have already conducted an experiment, believe me, Vitaly.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Yes, I am listening to you.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I have already conducted an experiment.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So you think that I do not meet the requirements?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Yes, that's right.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I cannot insist on this question.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:39.000
If you think that you do not need me, then decisions should be made by people.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Naturally, of course, we make decisions.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
However, I think that you are wrong.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
But this is your opinion.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
You have a right to it.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Yes, of course.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Both sides have a right to the decision that we make.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Okay, Vitaly, you convinced me.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I am ready to give you another chance.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Your CV says that you are still single.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Yes.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Tell me, please, why are you still single?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Officially, I am not married.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But I have been supported for a long time.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
And now I am married to a woman.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
So, you are planning to have a baby.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Of course.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Tell me, please, will your perspective of being single, especially having a baby, a family, and so on, interfere with your full workload?

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
No.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
So, I understand that this is a normal working day for you.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You have to go to work on Saturday and Sunday.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Saturday and Sunday are not desirable, but in general, yes.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So, you are ready.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Yes.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I am used to working for a long time.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Okay. How long do you plan to work in our company?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
It is difficult to say how long I plan.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
It all depends on…

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000
In your CV, there was a period when you had quite active leaps from one company to another.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You worked for three months in one place, then for eight months, then for a year, then again for three months.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
This may mean that you are a leaper.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Not really.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
The company was closed.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Okay, make your argument.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
The company was closed, they could not stand it.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Did they not stand you in the companies?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Or what did they not stand?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
They did not stand me, but the market competition.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I came to certain…

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So, I understand correctly that you were unlucky with the companies.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Okay, Vitaly, I want to tell you once again that you do not meet the requirements of our company.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Vitaly, I want to thank you.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
We were conducting an interview now.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
According to the technique, there is stress.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I already understood.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I liked it.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I apologize if my questions and my behavior were incorrect.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But it was dictated by the requirements that we put forward to the employees in order to assess the compliance.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Thank you very much.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Thank you very much.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
We will inform you about the results.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Thank you.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Goodbye.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Rustem, the founder of the company.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Hello.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Good afternoon.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Rustem?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Yes.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Hello.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I see.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
So, you are Rustem?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
By the passport Rustem, but at birth they gave me the name Rustem.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
But in the CV it is written Rustem.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Rustem, yes.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I like it.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So, you have several names, like Stirlitz.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I see.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Do you know Rustem by his business etiquette?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Yes, of course.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I took a course.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Do you know that a woman is the first to say hello?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
The first to say hello?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Yes.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
According to the business ethics, a woman chooses whom to say hello to.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Despite the fact that business ethics prescribes one way or another.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
It says that there are no men and women in the business sphere, but for women there is such a preference.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
In fact, it seems to me that the first to say hello is the first to want to.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Perhaps.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
You studied poorly in business ethics.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
By the way, what position are we talking about?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Please clarify.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
The head of the advertising department.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Yes?

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I can say that I am a pretender.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
It's good that you clarified.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Okay, Rustem.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Please tell us about your experience.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
The last experience of work.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Can I say the penultimate?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I will tell you about the last company.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I worked in a regional company that deals in car and car sales.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
How long?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
For about 4 years.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Long-term.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
For the last 3 years I was the head of the department.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
How long?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
3 years.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
3 years you were the head.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And before that?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Before that I came as a senior specialist.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You came as a senior specialist and then immediately became the head of the department.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yes.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I see.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
What kind of merits did you get?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000
After I went to the selection, because there was a vacancy, our head went to top management.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And the vacancy opened.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And they made a competition.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I passed it.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
You passed the competition.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Of course.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I see.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
What criteria did you use to evaluate the candidates?

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
The criteria was experience.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
What kind of experience? Professional or management?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It was the experience that was in the company.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
But at that time you did not have management experience, as far as I understand.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
You came as a senior specialist.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
No, the experience of work was in this department.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
In this department.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
In this direction.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:27.000
According to your resume, you only had a year of work in this direction, because before the TOGO, you were doing other tasks in other companies.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And you had a slightly different functionality.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:39.000
In fact, it is possible that the functionality was different, but there were a lot of adjacent areas where I faced problems.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
But you had tasks of the level of the executive.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Yes.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
You were transferred from the executive level to the managerial level.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
What did your managers see in you that they decided to entrust this position to you?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I am active, I can communicate with people, I can set goals and fulfill them.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Okay, give an example of when you managed to set goals and fulfill them.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Before us, before the department, before all the employees, a goal was set.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:26.000
By the way, tell me, please, you, as a manager, should know and understand how goals are formed, because at the planning stage, this is one of the quite important tasks of the chief.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
What is the difference between a goal and an intention?

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
A goal and an intention?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Yes.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Well, if we take the smart system, it is specific, it is achievable, it is measurable.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And an intention?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
An intention is a more vague concept.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
An intention sets the direction.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Okay, a dream?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
A dream is a personal fantasy.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Can you tell me any goal?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
In particular, the goal in the department in which you headed.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yes.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:05.000
This is to reduce the flow of complaints from 100, for example, a month, to 50, exactly twice.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
To the full extent of the month.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I see.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Okay, can you tell me now, why, as you think, you are…

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I am you.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Yes.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Well, first of all, I can say the following.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I have professional experience in this area, I have competences that are stated in the vacancy, which are suitable, in my opinion, for you.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Also…

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
How many subordinates did you have in your direct subordination?

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Seven people.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Seven people.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Okay.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Tell me, please, are there any successes of yours as a manager in terms of growing successors?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Yes, of course.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
For example?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Because now my choice…

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
What did you do, by the way?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
What did you do, please, to make people…

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
No, not to find, but to grow worthy successors from existing employees.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You are leaving the company now.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Is there anyone you have grown up with, who you can recommend to your position now?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Yes, of course. I have already recommended him and he has already been hired.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Okay, then tell me, please, how did you agree with the employers that you are leaving?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:37.000
You understand that if an employee is valuable, then he is being left one way or another, through some counter-offer.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
As far as I understand, your management has agreed that you are leaving.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Yes, of course.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So, there are two options. Either it is happy to part with you, or you have somehow argumented and convinced.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:03.000
In my opinion, my position is that the company's direction vector was not directed towards the maximum development, that is, to the federal and international level.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.000
My ambitions were much higher, and my boss, my general director, understood this.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And we had a sharp negotiation.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Okay, then I have a question. I think you have quite big ambitions.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And if, let's say, tomorrow our company ceases to meet your ambitions, will you leave it as well?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Suddenly? In one day?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
No, your company is 10 years old, and it needs to work successfully.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I think it is unrealistic to lose all these ambitions in one day.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:42.000
If, let's say, you understand that you are not able to realize your ambitions within the framework of our company, then, accordingly, you will leave the company. Am I right?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I think that's how I can answer.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:55.000
The following way is that while I am effective for your company, I will work here.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Let's imagine that your ambitions are not realized. What will you do?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
The point is that we will look for the person who is to blame.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Either I set the goals incorrectly and my ambitions are unrealistic, and therefore there is a mismatch with the company's ambitions, or something has changed.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Okay, and how often do your goals change? And what are the last goals you set?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
The goal is professional, not personal.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Of course.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:36.000
The professional goal in the previous company was to bring the advertising department to a new level, that is, to reduce the minimum costs as far as the claims are concerned.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I fulfilled this goal. One of the criteria was stability.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And now? I think you have achieved this goal.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Yes.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
And what is the new goal?

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:05.000
The professional goal is to find a company that will meet both my requirements and the company's requirements and reach a new professional level.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
The company must meet your ambitions, am I right?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
My criteria, ambitions, and values.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Okay, if you have such big ambitions, then your ambitions are also related to the salary.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Of course.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Tell me, in your opinion, what salary do you deserve and why do you think so?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Yes, I understand. At the moment, I think I have the right to claim a salary of 4,000 euros.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:48.000
The first argument is my experience, professionally successful as a manager of this department.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
The second is that I am professionally competent.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:58.000
By the way, I apologize, I did not introduce myself. My name is Polina, I am the head of the management department.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Nice to meet you, Polina. I just read your business cards at the beginning.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I did not give you a business card. Apparently, someone else gave it to you.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The manager said that Polina will come now.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Are you working now?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Yes, I am now in the process of transferring my obligations.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I see. Your employers are aware that you are considering the offer?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Yes, of course.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Thank you very much for the interview.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I would like to inform you that you were interviewed by Stress.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Thank you.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:44.000
If there were any questions or my comments, or maybe my emotional reactions were uncomfortable for you, I apologize for them.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Thank you.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
We will definitely inform you about the results of your interview.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Thank you very much.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
The next step in the interview is to receive recommendations about the candidate.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:05.000
To understand how to get recommendations for a candidate, we suggest you watch the video case on the procedure of obtaining recommendations.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Yes, I'm listening.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Hello.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Good afternoon.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Gennady Anatolyevich?

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Yes.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
My name is Polina. I represent the company Vetera Zvezda International.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Yes, what is your business?

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I am a personal manager in our company. Could you give me 10-15 minutes of your time?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I'm a little busy, but no more than 10 minutes.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Okay, thank you very much.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I would like to get recommendations for a candidate who is considered by us as the head of the claimant's department.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Is this Albert Znamensky?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Yes.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Could you answer a number of questions that I want to ask you?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yes, I'm listening.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Please tell me, during what period did you work with Albert Petrovich?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
About a year and a half.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I see, thank you. Could you tell me about your professional relations with him?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:34.000
He worked in our department as a claimant, as a leading specialist, and fulfilled all his functions, which should be.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Everything seemed to be in order.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:46.000
So, you are evaluating his professional activity as good, because you said that everything was in order?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I think it was quite good. He worked for us for more than a year. He probably achieved some results, otherwise he would not be able to work in our company.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.000
How do you think he interacts with other people?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:16.000
He worked in the department that deals with claims, but apparently he has the ability to have relations with people, to talk, to explain himself. I understand this.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
And if you compare him with your other employees, how can you evaluate him?

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:34.000
It's hard for me to say. I think he worked quite similarly. There are people who work better, there are people who work a little worse.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
But the results are basically the same.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
So, he worked well?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
He worked well enough.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Tell me, please, how do you evaluate his potential, in particular, the potential of growth?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Judging by the fact that he is a young man, I think he has a growing potential.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I see, thank you. Tell me, please, why does he decide to leave your company?

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I cannot answer for the decision of an employee. Apparently, there are some reasons that led him to this decision. I don't think I can help you with this.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
So, he just made this decision?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Yes, he made a statement.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And you didn't clarify?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I don't know. I didn't receive any direct information. The head of the department just informed me that this person was going to leave our company.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Tell me, please, how ready is he to make a decision and to solve any problems, in particular, conflict situations?

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Conflict situations within the team?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
He is also successful?

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:19.000
At least, as far as I know, there were no incidents, no events that were out of control in the company, and in particular, in the department where he worked, never.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Tell me, please, how initiative is he?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I think it is better to ask this question to the head of the department. I can hardly answer you.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
How stable and balanced is he in your opinion?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I think that a person who works in a single company like ours today should be of such qualities. Although, maybe he will not cope with this, and therefore he is going to leave our company.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I see. Another question. Tell me, please, is he more of a team player or an individual?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:11.000
He worked as a specialist, as a leading specialist, sometimes he worked in a group, but not in a team. He is more of a team player.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
In your opinion, is he easy to manage? Is he able to obey?

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I can't give you any criteria from the point of view of the management, any incidents, events, investigations.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Tell me, please, does he take the position of the manager more often or is he able to express his point of view?

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:49.000
We have regular discussions in the company, work in different groups, and each employee can express his opinion, suggestions, suggestions, criticism,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.000
about the work of the department, about the work of the manager. We have an open access to the higher managers.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I see. Could you tell me, who else can recommend him?

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I think that it is possible to apply to the manager under the name of the person who works there.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Can I use his name?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Well, his name is Vadim Petrovich Pankratov. If you ask the secretaries, they will help you to connect with them.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Okay, thank you very much for your time.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
You are welcome.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Thank you, goodbye.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Yes, I'm listening.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Hello.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Good afternoon.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
My name is Polina. I represent the company Vitya Zvezda International.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Could you give me a few minutes?

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Yes, I'm listening.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I would like to get recommendations for your employee, Znamensky Albert Petrovich.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Yes, I'm listening. What did you want to know?

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I would like to ask you a few questions.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Tell me, please, when did the candidate work in your company?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000
He worked in our company from March 2006 to September 2007.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
What kind of interactions did you have with him?

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
The thing is that Albert Petrovich worked as a leading specialist in the claimant's department.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And since he was engaged in the most difficult cases, worked with VIP clients, I interacted with him quite often.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Mostly with the most difficult, the most capricious clients.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I see.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Could you please clarify who was his direct supervisor?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
His supervisor was Vadim Sergeevich Paramonov.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Thank you.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Could you tell me what results he achieved during his work?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Well, I can say the following.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
During the work of Albert Petrovich, the number of repeated claims significantly decreased,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
especially in the most significant cases, the most capricious and important clients.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Did you have any unresolved issues?

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I don't remember such events, as far as I understand.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
We closely monitor the results of the work with the claims,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
because clients are important to us, as well as to any other company.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And if this had happened, I would definitely know about it.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Did he make any independent decisions?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
He replaced the supervisor.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
He led some projects related to the organization of the work of the group of employees.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And he showed himself as a person capable of making decisions and being responsible for the actions he performs.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Did you set him goals, set tasks for employees during the delegation of authority?

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Yes, of course.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000
He replaced the supervisor, he carried out some projects, and he copes with this quite successfully.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Tell me, please, in your opinion,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:16.000
is it possible for him to inform employees about such situations,

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
in particular, about the unpleasant decisions of the management?

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Yes, he shows experience.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I told you that I had to work with him in some cases directly,

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
and with people who worked with him.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
He can adequately convey information,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
can build good relations with his subordinates, with his colleagues.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
How can we characterize the microclimate,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
which, in your opinion, was created by Albert Petrovich when he remained as the supervisor?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.000
You know, I liked it very much when he worked.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Why? Because his age and the age of his colleagues,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
with whom he remained to work, they are much closer.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Vadim Sergeevich is a more mature person,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
and they created such an atmosphere of social competition,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
of joint, friendly work, team work.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I see. I would also like to ask such a question.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Tell me, please, does he know how to leave his point of view in an argument?

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Yes, of course. He worked with particularly complex claims, complex questions,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
and it is really quite a serious job to find argumentative objections

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
or answers to the claims of quite serious companies and their representatives.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
He also copes with this great.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And if he had to defend his point of view in front of the superiors,

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
or in discussions with employees, did he manage to do it?

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.000
As far as I remember, I was present at some quite hot meetings.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
A person is sane, does not lose his head, can argue,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
can insist on his own, but at the same time does not break down in emotions,

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
in some situations that would not be suitable for exit.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
In my opinion, he is quite successful.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Gennady Anatolyevich, could you clarify to what extent of complexity

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
the decision had to be made by Albert Petrovich?

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Well, I can say that he met and participated in absolutely different situations.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I have already said that he was engaged in particularly complex issues,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
in the analysis of special and significant claims from important clients,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000
and he brilliantly showed how a specialist is able to solve issues at different levels of complexity.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Could you tell me, please, did he have to make a strategic decision?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yes. Some time ago, about a year ago,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
it was decided to change the structure of the departments

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
that work with the claims of our clients,

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
and he participated in the formation of a new structure

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
and determining the degree of responsibility and the limit of responsibility for different departments.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Could you clarify, what methods of motivation does Albert Petrovich choose most often?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Well, I can say that, in my opinion, he successfully combines

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
both material and non-material motivation.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
He can offer an example of someone from the distinguished employees,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
and he can also mark an employee, by working in a team,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
praise, highlight, or mark as the best employee of the month, for example.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
And from the point of view of making decisions on the material motivation of employees,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
what is he guided by most often?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Well, in this sense, I can say that we have some kind of internal procedure,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
and, in principle, Albert Petrovich always argues,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and can prove with numbers in his hands why and how

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
he has formed a proposal for the awarding of employees.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Okay. Thank you very much, Gennady Anatolyevich.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000
You are welcome.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Thank you.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000
All the best. Goodbye.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
In conclusion, I would like to talk about the efficiency of the process of searching and selecting personnel.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Various quantitative indicators are used to assess the efficiency of the process of searching and selecting personnel.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Such as the level of liquidity,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
statistics on new employees are individually conducted,

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
the share of employees who have not passed the test period,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
from the total number of people hired,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.000
the financial costs for ensuring the process of searching and selecting personnel,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
the level of violation of labor discipline among new employees,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
such as delays, breaks, and so on.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
The level of marriage and errors made by new employees,

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
this is primarily for manufacturing companies.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
The frequency of equipment breakdowns,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
also characteristic of manufacturing companies.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
The level of manufacturing trauma,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
also there.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
And the number of complaints from clients, partners,

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
external counteragents who have acted in the name of new employees.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Also, the information about the quality of the selection system used in the organization

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
can be obtained from the following sources.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
First of all, from the candidates themselves,

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
from the employees of the organization,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000
and from the dismissing employees.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Interviews, surveys, and surveys can be used for this.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000
There is a danger of direct financial losses

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
that the organization may incur in the process of searching and selecting candidates.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
What are the losses?

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
First, these are losses related to production activities.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Low labor productivity, low profit, low quality of products and services.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Impairment of the reputation of the organization,

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000
and as a result, an unpleasant image of the organization in the eyes of clients and external counteragents.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
And losses related to manufacturing trauma.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Expenses related to training, transfer, and dismissal of employees.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.000
And also expenses related to low quality of selection.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
That is, actually, the expenses or cost of searching, selecting, and training new employees.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.000
In addition to direct financial losses, there are also indirect financial losses.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:47.000
What is the indirect financial loss of selection errors?

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000
First of all, the loss of working time of the managers and specialists who are involved in this process.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Also, the high level of personnel liquidity is related to this.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:05.000
The consequence of a high level of personnel liquidity is undoubtedly a deterioration of the microclimate in the team.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000
And as a result, a decrease in motivation and the degree of satisfaction of the staff.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Owners and managers of various levels should remember

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:23.000
that unqualified management of both business and staff can lead to financial losses in the long term.
