00:00.000 --> 00:27.500
What models of organization change are offered to have some points that would allow to control intermediate criteria, intermediate variables and track the direction of development,

00:27.500 --> 00:31.000
and track the direction of change that is happening.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.500
As in the models of growth of the organization, here were offered many models.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.500
Again, about these models you can read in the literature that is applied to this course.

00:44.000 --> 00:55.500
But we will stop today on those programs of change that have recommended their effectiveness, which were almost significant.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
One of these models of change is the model of Backhard.

01:01.500 --> 01:20.000
As for Backhard, it tried to find those characteristics of change that lead to success and justify the risk associated with changes.

01:21.000 --> 01:40.500
From its point of view, in order to make changes successful, the program of these changes should initially formulate the goals of changes and determine the results that will be achieved in the future.

01:40.500 --> 01:57.000
The goal should be determined only after the goals are formulated.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.000
But setting goals is the first stage.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.000
The next stage is the diagnosis of the state that is taking place.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.500
It is necessary to assess the state that is now.

02:12.000 --> 02:23.500
The actual availability of funds, the actual availability of opportunities, the actual availability of personnel, the actual business communication, business relations, business processes that exist.

02:24.500 --> 02:34.000
And at the same time, it is necessary to assess the results that will be achieved.

02:34.500 --> 02:39.000
What is the gap between what is and what should be.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.500
When we make this assessment, we can assess how significant, radical, and fundamental the changes will be.

02:50.000 --> 03:02.500
How easy or hard it will be to overcome the resistance of personnel, managers, to implement certain tasks.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.500
We must assess the size of this gap between what is and what should be.

03:07.500 --> 03:22.000
This diagnosis is necessary because I can set the most wonderful tasks, but at the same time, these tasks will be unrealistic for the achievement of this company at this time, in this part of the market.

03:22.500 --> 03:30.000
Still, the change that is being made should be real, but it cannot be abstract.

03:30.500 --> 03:37.000
The next stage, according to Bethardt, should be the development of a plan of action for the transition period.

03:37.500 --> 03:42.000
We have already discussed that there should be changes.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.000
We have made a program of changes, we have diagnosed the situation.

03:46.500 --> 03:55.000
And then comes the transition period between what is and what we are starting to change.

03:55.500 --> 04:07.000
Functioning, personnel, structure, division, we change plans, we change interactions, we change relationships.

04:07.500 --> 04:20.000
At the same time, we must constantly react to feedback and react to the changes that are happening within the organization when these changes have started.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
What is the resistance to these changes?

04:23.500 --> 04:35.000
Is it not so high that people will support the changes and, accordingly, we will not be able to get the results that we need?

04:35.000 --> 04:48.500
The transition period is a period of preparation of the organization personnel, of the organization employees for the changes, for the processes that will inevitably take place.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.500
People are tasked with achieving some significant changes in their work.

04:58.500 --> 05:08.000
A person always resists changes because he knows what he is doing, what will be changed, he does not know what results can be achieved.

05:08.500 --> 05:15.000
In this regard, a certain transition period is needed, a period of pumping, we will talk about it in more detail.

05:15.000 --> 05:29.500
A period of pumping, when a certain number of personnel of the organization will begin to move to a new functioning, a new way of action.

05:30.000 --> 05:40.500
A certain number of adherents of new paradigms of behavior, of new paradigms of action must be formed.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.000
In any company there are both innovators and adapters.

05:45.500 --> 05:55.000
At this stage, at the stage of the transition period, it is necessary to bring out innovators, those people who are ready for changes, those people who are ready for restorization,

05:55.500 --> 06:09.000
those people who are interested in changes, which are not satisfied with the already established routine, who are initiative, who give new proposals and who are happy to accept something new.

06:10.000 --> 06:25.500
The next stage of changes is the development of strategies and action plans for managing the transition from the already existing state to what should be.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.500
We have a team of innovators who are ready to make changes.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.500
We already have someone to rely on, we have those who will pull the curtain of these changes.

06:39.000 --> 06:53.500
And now it is necessary, relying on their abilities, their authority, their efforts, their knowledge, their experience, their leadership qualities, to formulate a program of further change.

06:53.500 --> 07:11.000
So that from the transition period, when we are only trying to get adherence to changes, we can move directly to organizational development, which does not allow the return back.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.500
When both employees and staff understand that there is no return to the old.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.500
And whether you want it or not, we will function according to new rules, new plans, new patterns.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.500
And either you adapt to them, or you have to leave the company.

07:33.500 --> 07:42.000
As for the Becker model, it reflects the most difficult initial stage.

07:42.500 --> 07:49.000
The stage of development, the stage of formation, the stage of preparation for organizational changes.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.500
As we have already said, the attitude of people to changes is a rather significant task.

07:57.000 --> 08:13.500
Because it is people, it is the human factor, who determine all the problems, all the difficulties, all the successes, all the speeds that will occur in the process of organizational change.

08:14.500 --> 08:25.000
Many factors were considered, which assessed the influence of the human factor on the success of changes.

08:26.000 --> 08:45.500
From this point of view, many authors, Birr, Beckford, Egan, Lippet, Solzat, Adjiris, Adziezis, considered many examples of successful changes.

08:45.500 --> 08:52.000
Plus, again, a large number of changes that ended in failure.

08:52.500 --> 09:05.000
And based on the analysis of these processes, they highlighted 6 steps, 6 points, 6 conditions for success of changes.

09:06.000 --> 09:19.500
From their point of view, before we start hoping that the changes will lead to the desired result,

09:20.000 --> 09:26.500
it is necessary to mobilize commitment to these changes through joint analysis of problems.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.000
There are innovators in the company, there are adapters in the company.

09:31.500 --> 09:41.000
There are people who understand that the way the company is developing now cannot further support its growth.

09:41.500 --> 09:46.000
Some innovations are necessary.

09:47.000 --> 09:59.500
These adapters and changes need to be mobilized and created a team of them, as we talked about Beckford's model.

10:00.000 --> 10:15.500
And through joint analysis, brainstorming, we will develop those changes, plans, points, strategies that will occur.

10:16.000 --> 10:24.500
Naturally, this strategy should fit into the guidelines that exist from the point of view of the company leaders,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.500
from the point of view of those who are making these changes.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.500
Because although all changes are made through the staff of the company,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.500
the initiator of the changes, the person who is responsible for these changes,

10:39.500 --> 10:47.000
is still the owner of the company, the one who is in charge of the company's acceptance.

10:47.500 --> 10:56.000
The second condition for successful changes is the creation of a general vision of organizational processes.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.000
This is what we want to achieve.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
It is not enough to develop a general plan.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.500
This plan should be divided among as many employees as possible,

11:07.000 --> 11:14.500
so that they agree with the results, with the goals that will be achieved.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.500
After this general vision is developed,

11:19.000 --> 11:26.500
it is necessary to stimulate the acceptance of this new vision not only by innovators, but also by adapters.

11:27.500 --> 11:37.000
In order for the adapters to understand that, yes, of course, we can use the recommended methods and approaches.

11:37.500 --> 11:45.000
But nevertheless, there are new options that may be more successful.

11:45.500 --> 11:50.000
And there are people, the same innovators, who are ready to take a risk and try.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.000
Well, okay, let's see what they can do.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.500
But the main thing here is not the obvious and absolute rejection of the changes,

12:02.000 --> 12:09.500
but at least the acceptance of the agreement that there is a certain vision.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.500
Well, okay, let them see. We will not interfere at least.

12:14.500 --> 12:27.000
The next, fourth factor of success is that the activity of different units of existing companies is increasing.

12:27.500 --> 12:32.000
We have repeatedly said that a company has its own structure,

12:32.500 --> 12:41.000
and each of the units performs the necessary functions to achieve the results that this company produces.

12:41.000 --> 12:50.500
At the same time, the activity of the unit must be increased without pressure from above, without authoritarian leadership.

12:51.000 --> 13:02.500
It is important not to force these changes, but to allow each unit, each structure to move at its own pace.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.500
If we start to put pressure, it will not lead to any good results.

13:09.500 --> 13:14.000
If we start to support the positive growth that arises,

13:14.500 --> 13:19.000
then a person begins to see that he is being counted on,

13:19.500 --> 13:25.000
and that, perhaps, the results that we want to achieve will be interesting to him as well.

13:27.500 --> 13:34.000
If we have reached this stage, then, accordingly, the organization is already pumped up.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.500
Accordingly, there are already different factors for changing the process of organizational development.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.500
And we can move on to the next condition.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.500
This is the institutionalization of the changes that are taking place,

13:54.000 --> 14:00.500
the creation of formal structures, formal systems according to a new schedule,

14:00.500 --> 14:10.000
new goals, new tasks, institutionalization, legalization of new elements,

14:10.500 --> 14:14.000
new structural components that are introduced into the company.

14:14.500 --> 14:23.000
And, of course, it is necessary to control and correct the strategies of changes that are taking place at each stage,

14:23.500 --> 14:26.000
depending on the resistance that we face,

14:26.500 --> 14:30.000
depending on the requirements that the market presents to us.

14:30.500 --> 14:38.000
Correction and control are an emphasis on feedback.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.000
The company will never make changes in a vacuum,

14:42.500 --> 14:47.000
and no one will wait for me to change something and release a new product.

14:47.500 --> 14:53.000
We always make all the changes in a tough competitive struggle that is taking place.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.000
These are the six factors that were highlighted.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.500
Of course, you can add some other factors, you can argue with the presence of some of these six factors.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.500
It is not so important for us now, because these are the factors that were taken from practical experience.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.500
This is not a theoretical development, these are some academic concepts.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.500
These are analysis and generalization of both the successful experience of changes carried out in different companies,

15:22.500 --> 15:29.000
and, accordingly, the results of many failures.

15:29.500 --> 15:35.000
But we constantly say that all companies, all organizations,

15:35.500 --> 15:40.000
they exist together with other companies, they exist on the market,

15:40.500 --> 15:45.000
and they have some internal driving forces, some internal braking forces,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.000
internal structures of internal interactions.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.500
In other words, there are both external and internal reasons for changes.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.500
What are the external reasons for changes?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.500
There are three main reasons.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.500
First of all, these are, of course, economic reasons, which we have already talked about many times today.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.500
We are on the market.

16:14.500 --> 16:21.000
As for the market, there is a demand, there are some proposals that satisfy this demand.

16:21.500 --> 16:27.000
There are consumers who invest in the acquisition of products and services that exist.

16:27.500 --> 16:34.000
And, accordingly, depending on the purchasing demand, depending on the purchasing ability,

16:34.500 --> 16:39.000
depending on the factors of economic growth, on the factors of economic development,

16:39.000 --> 16:48.500
depending on the structure of the system, there are different consumer stereotypes.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.500
There are different requests for certain products and services,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.500
and all these requests should, first of all, be satisfied,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.500
and, secondly, they should be worked on and existed one step ahead.

17:03.500 --> 17:13.000
We should predict new requests and we should form these new requests.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.000
These are economic reasons.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.000
In addition, there are social reasons for changes.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.000
First of all, this is, of course, politics.

17:23.500 --> 17:30.000
Political requirements, political system, the coming to power of those or other leaders,

17:30.000 --> 17:35.500
each of whom has its own economic team, its own economists,

17:36.000 --> 17:40.500
its own ideas about how the economy should develop,

17:41.000 --> 17:47.500
what priorities should be, what national projects there are,

17:48.000 --> 17:54.500
what priorities exist in the development of the world economy,

17:55.500 --> 18:03.000
where and in what aspects we have a competitive advantage compared to other countries,

18:03.500 --> 18:07.000
what we can develop, what we can achieve.

18:07.500 --> 18:14.000
Any new team of economists, having a certain education, a certain experience,

18:14.500 --> 18:22.000
a certain achievement, depending on the existing policy, becomes dominant,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.500
and we can either help the development of small business,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.500
which, for example, in Russia has been striving to be realized since the early 90s,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.500
but we all know that these results were far from always successful.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.500
We can help the development of medium business, we can help the development of large business,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.500
we can help the development of private business,

18:47.500 --> 18:57.000
or create various state corporations that will be engaged in the implementation of the most successful developments

18:57.500 --> 19:02.000
in terms of economic support of the state and political structures.

19:02.500 --> 19:07.000
In addition to politics, demography is also of great importance.

19:09.500 --> 19:17.000
Any economic company, any company, any economy is, first of all, a workplace.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.000
It is, first of all, the purchasing power of the population.

19:20.500 --> 19:26.000
It is, first of all, the ability to pay for certain services.

19:26.500 --> 19:32.000
It is, first of all, certain claims and achievements that people have.

19:32.500 --> 19:38.000
It is their preferences about what a successful life is, a car, a dacha, an apartment.

19:38.500 --> 19:45.000
These ideas change, and they change depending on the number of the population,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.500
depending on the age group of the population, depending on the gender composition of the population,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.500
depending on the educational level of the population, depending on the income of the population,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.500
10% of the richest, 10% of the poorest.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.500
These are all the social factors that exist.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.500
Again, if the population growth is declining, or if the population surplus is increasing,

20:08.500 --> 20:13.000
the population surplus leads to a large increase in the elderly,

20:13.500 --> 20:16.000
who need pension support.

20:16.500 --> 20:27.000
A large number of young people lead to the need for education,

20:27.500 --> 20:34.000
to the construction of an education system, to the creation of new jobs, and so on.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.500
These are all the social factors that exist, and we cannot ignore them.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.500
No company exists in a vacuum.

20:43.000 --> 20:52.500
All economic, professional, labor and business actions exist in these economic and social conditions.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.500
The third reason for the change is the change in technology.

20:57.500 --> 21:03.000
The technological reason is that we live in a state of technological progress.

21:03.500 --> 21:16.000
If in the 19th century there were no electric bulbs,

21:16.500 --> 21:21.000
today we cannot imagine life without electricity,

21:21.000 --> 21:28.500
without different electric stoves, electric heaters, electric kettles.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.500
This is all technological progress.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.500
In the end, the computers that surround us now, the information systems that we measure,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.500
the same way of learning that we are now doing,

21:39.000 --> 21:43.500
we are doing remote learning with the help of video equipment,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.500
this is all that was not available 100 years ago.

21:49.500 --> 22:00.000
Of course, these new technological innovations are a very powerful economic factor

22:00.500 --> 22:05.000
that uses demand and forms demand.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.000
The more computers there are, the more demand for software is.

22:09.500 --> 22:15.000
The more communication between computers and the Internet,

22:15.000 --> 22:21.500
the more problems arise with information exchange, electronic document processing, etc.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.500
All these technological innovations need to be taken into account

22:30.000 --> 22:38.500
because they give a certain offer, and this offer will either be in demand or not.

22:39.500 --> 22:45.000
So, this is what concerns external reasons, economic, social, technological,

22:45.500 --> 22:48.000
which reflect the changes that are taking place in business,

22:48.500 --> 22:50.000
the changes that are taking place in the social sphere,

22:50.500 --> 22:54.000
and the changes that are taking place in the scientific and technical sphere, in the scientific and technical potential.

22:54.500 --> 23:00.000
In addition to external reasons, as we have repeatedly noted today,

23:00.500 --> 23:03.000
there are also internal reasons for changes.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.500
Internal factors of transformation are related to these internal reasons for changes.

23:10.000 --> 23:20.500
These are procedural changes, decisions, communication disruptions, interaction disruptions.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.500
All that we have discussed, for example, about the interaction between different units

23:26.000 --> 23:30.500
in the company where this or that development system is carried out.

23:30.500 --> 23:36.000
On the other hand, in addition to procedural changes, there are also behavioral problems, behavioral factors,

23:36.500 --> 23:42.000
which are related, for example, to the lack of competence of employees,

23:42.500 --> 23:50.000
to the high level of flow of cards, to the little attention paid to the staff,

23:50.500 --> 23:57.000
to the insufficiently effective management, to various styles of management.

23:57.000 --> 24:04.500
All this needs to be taken into account, because the changes, as we have repeatedly mentioned,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.500
and according to the models that we have considered,

24:08.000 --> 24:15.500
they significantly depend on the relationships within the company.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.500
Do I associate my life with this company, or do I consider my further development,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.500
my work environment with other companies?

24:24.500 --> 24:29.000
Am I interested in taking part in the changes within my company,

24:29.500 --> 24:33.000
or am I more interested in finding another company

24:33.500 --> 24:38.000
that will not bring me unnecessary headaches with these or other organizational changes?

24:38.500 --> 24:45.000
There will be a lot of internal reasons, because all these reasons are related to human motivation,

24:45.500 --> 24:51.000
human activity, human cognitive abilities, human achievements,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.500
human commitments, human ambitions.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.500
And all this needs to be taken into account in order not to face internal reluctance,

25:02.000 --> 25:07.500
internal sabotage to change, because change is already a complex process.

25:08.000 --> 25:18.500
And if I constantly interfere with this, or deliberately worsen the results,

25:18.500 --> 25:27.000
then, of course, with all my will, I will not be able to change the effect.

25:27.500 --> 25:36.000
When we talk about organizational changes, about the events in the organization,

25:36.500 --> 25:44.000
then it is necessary to remember some fundamental ideas of these changes.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.500
Again, what concerns the situation we are going to discuss now,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.500
it is the result of generalizing practical experience.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.500
So, as for the changes, it is necessary to understand that this is a natural phenomenon.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.500
Everything that exists in nature, everything that exists in the economy,

26:05.000 --> 26:11.500
everything that exists in the surrounding world, it is constantly changing.

26:11.500 --> 26:15.000
There are no unchanging things.

26:15.500 --> 26:20.000
There is always one or another evolutionary line, evolutionary scheme.

26:20.500 --> 26:25.000
Changes are made continuously and gradually.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.000
Changes are a constant process.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.000
There cannot be a situation that today we have changes,

26:33.500 --> 26:37.000
and then we live a month calmly, and then we make changes.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.500
Changes are a continuous process.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.500
If there are no changes, it is stagnation, it is stagnation with all the consequences.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.500
At the same time, changes are a progressive process,

26:49.000 --> 26:56.500
because every new innovation is based on the innovations that were before.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.500
And, accordingly, progressiveness is a necessary criterion for change

27:02.000 --> 27:05.500
if we want to get a successful result.

27:05.500 --> 27:11.000
The goal of change is not to make changes for the sake of change,

27:11.500 --> 27:16.000
but to help growth and survival, the survival of the organization.

27:16.500 --> 27:20.000
The market conditions are constantly changing, as we have discussed,

27:20.500 --> 27:26.000
and we must constantly keep these changes in mind.

27:26.500 --> 27:30.000
This is where the conditions of our growth are laid.

27:30.500 --> 27:35.000
The results of changes depend on adaptation to changing conditions.

27:35.500 --> 27:41.000
We cannot make changes against the will of people working in the organization.

27:41.500 --> 27:47.000
We make functional changes, we make changes in actions

27:47.500 --> 27:53.000
that affect the actions of specific people, specific employees, specific staff.

27:53.500 --> 27:58.000
And therefore, we must adapt all the people working.

27:58.500 --> 28:03.000
If a person is not adapted to these changes, he will not be able to, he will not want to work.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.500
He will be the balance to be rid of.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.500
Changes are assumed to be their acceptance.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.500
Adaptation is needed for this.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.500
As for changes, it is necessary to keep in mind

28:23.000 --> 28:29.500
that there are global changes that affect the whole organization as such,

28:29.500 --> 28:38.000
and there are private changes that can affect the improvement of the work of a particular unit,

28:38.500 --> 28:42.000
the change of functional duties, the change of plans, the change of contracts.

28:42.500 --> 28:50.000
These are changes that do not require the change of the existing structure, the existing circumstances.

28:50.000 --> 28:59.500
These are improvements of the stages, the factors of development that occur.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.500
That is why changes are a natural process,

29:06.000 --> 29:12.500
a natural process of the organization's functioning, a natural process of the organization's existence.

29:12.500 --> 29:22.000
Understanding this fact is a condition that resistance to these changes will be overcome

29:22.500 --> 29:26.000
and we will achieve the desired result for us.

29:26.500 --> 29:30.000
We have been talking about changes since the very beginning,

29:30.500 --> 29:33.000
how they occur, what models exist.

29:33.500 --> 29:38.000
But at the same time, changes themselves are different.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.500
The classification of these changes was proposed,

29:43.000 --> 29:49.500
which allows us to divide the processes that occur within these changes,

29:50.000 --> 29:54.500
the methods that are used when we carry out one or another organizational change,

29:55.000 --> 29:59.500
the consequences that may occur, the results of the strategy that are manifested.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.500
As for the classification of changes, there are many different schemes.

30:05.500 --> 30:11.000
We will again start from the scheme that is in practice,

30:11.500 --> 30:18.000
from the scheme that describes the process of changes occurring in commercial organizations

30:18.500 --> 30:25.000
and which leads to the desired results in business.

30:25.500 --> 30:29.000
The first type of change is the so-called revolutionary change.

30:29.500 --> 30:34.000
This type of change has nothing to do with bloody changes.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.500
Revolutionary change is a qualitatively different functioning of an organization.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.500
It is a change in financial activity, it is a merger of organizations,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.500
absorption of organizations, change of shareholders of organizations.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.500
That is, all the processes that occur are completely changed.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.500
It is not an expansion, addition of what has already been.

31:02.500 --> 31:12.000
It is a radical change of management, a radical change of people, personnel,

31:12.500 --> 31:15.000
a radical change of structure.

31:15.500 --> 31:23.000
In fact, it is the creation of a qualitatively new, qualitatively excellent organization.

31:23.500 --> 31:31.000
As for revolutionary changes, they capture the whole organization from bottom to top

31:31.000 --> 31:36.500
and these changes occur in a leap.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.500
They are either there or not.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.500
The second type of change is evolutionary change.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.500
Evolutionary change is a kind of continuous process.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.500
When we achieve some results that prove their effectiveness,

31:53.500 --> 32:00.000
we consolidate these results and move on to the next result.

32:00.500 --> 32:07.000
We constantly increase the sales plan, we introduce new products and services into the market.

32:07.500 --> 32:14.000
But at the same time, the structure of interaction, the structure of functioning remains unchanged.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.000
There are no revolutionary changes in competence,

32:18.000 --> 32:26.500
no new form-grading, no changes in key efficiency indicators, etc.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.500
We have a certain goal of getting profit, getting dividends.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.500
To achieve this goal, to get better and better results,

32:38.000 --> 32:46.500
we constantly make some innovations, consolidate them and move on.

32:46.500 --> 32:52.000
This process is gradual, without any leaps, as we have discussed earlier.

32:52.500 --> 32:56.000
The next type of change is strategic change.

32:56.500 --> 33:01.000
Strategic changes lead to serious organizational transformations.

33:01.500 --> 33:06.000
But again, they are similar to revolutionary changes,

33:06.500 --> 33:11.000
but at the same time, they are changes within the existing structure.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.500
For example, the creation of a new department.

33:16.000 --> 33:23.500
There is a sales department, and within it, a sales department for legal entities is created.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.500
This is because the number of contracts and agreements has increased recently,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.500
not with the physical entities, but with legal entities.

33:36.500 --> 33:42.000
Therefore, the strategic plans of the organization may change.

33:42.500 --> 33:48.000
When we, in addition to the physical entities, start interacting with legal entities.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.000
This is a strategic change.

33:50.500 --> 33:56.000
It does not require revolutionary changes, because we will work on the old principles,

33:56.500 --> 33:59.000
we will work with the old products.

33:59.500 --> 34:05.000
We simply change the market niche in which we work and create a new department.

34:05.500 --> 34:10.000
This department naturally requires organizational changes.

34:10.500 --> 34:17.000
In addition to strategic changes, there are also operational or tactical changes.

34:17.500 --> 34:23.000
They are associated with the introduction of new systems, procedures, technologies

34:23.500 --> 34:27.000
that influence the development of an organizational project,

34:27.500 --> 34:32.000
that influence the promotion of a product.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.500
Operational changes are a 7-minute response to the feedback we receive.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.500
For operational changes, revolutionary leaps are not necessary.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.500
Strategic planning changes are not necessary.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.500
For example, we introduce a new product for sale.

34:57.500 --> 35:03.000
And we see that this product is more popular among young people.

35:03.500 --> 35:13.000
Accordingly, we start changing advertising, PR, in terms of changing the target audience.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.000
These are operational changes.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.000
We have not changed the product.

35:17.500 --> 35:24.000
We have increased the sphere of influence to the age category,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.500
which is more interesting.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.500
This classification allows us to evaluate the results that will be obtained,

35:35.000 --> 35:43.500
as well as the approaches, methods and models of change that we will talk about now.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.500
However, before moving on to the models of change,

35:47.000 --> 35:53.500
it is necessary to say a few words about the process of change.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.500
All the changes that we are talking about, revolutionary, evolutionary, strategic, operational.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.500
With all the abundance of changes, with all the variety of companies,

36:05.000 --> 36:11.500
with all the problems that arise in the market,

36:12.000 --> 36:18.500
only three types of mechanisms for changing can be distinguished.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.500
First of all, these are innovations.

36:22.500 --> 36:31.000
We create a new product, we offer a new service, we change the functionality, we introduce something new.

36:31.500 --> 36:40.000
Not what has already been, but what has not yet been recommended.

36:40.500 --> 36:44.000
Any innovation is a risk, as we said.

36:44.500 --> 36:52.000
Because innovation can lead to a breakthrough, it can lead to unpaid costs.

36:52.500 --> 37:00.000
Secondly, innovation is a planned process.

37:00.500 --> 37:06.000
Because we make strategic plans, we create structures, we select personnel,

37:06.500 --> 37:13.000
we write a business plan that concerns the investment that we will make.

37:13.500 --> 37:21.000
Innovation is always planned, we can somehow track the results that are obtained.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.500
Another mechanism of flow is spontaneous processes.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.500
Spontaneous processes are connected with the fact that we suddenly get some new result.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.500
And then we want to see how successful this result will be from the point of view of the business process.

37:40.500 --> 37:51.000
Some kind of addition to our product, some kind of change in the payment and service scheme.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.000
This is a spontaneous process.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.000
Some manager can do it, and he can do it.

37:56.500 --> 38:01.000
Then we analyze the sales plan, analyze the success of his work,

38:01.500 --> 38:06.000
and we can conclude that what he did within his competence,

38:06.000 --> 38:12.500
within his plan, will be useful if other managers will do it.

38:13.000 --> 38:20.500
There was no special program for introducing a new process.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.500
There was no planned change in advance.

38:24.000 --> 38:31.500
It turned out spontaneously, but its results were valuable, and we are now starting to implement this process.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.500
If it works, we will implement it. If it doesn't work, we won't implement it.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.500
These spontaneous processes are less important than innovations,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.500
because they don't require substantial investments.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.500
But the benefit that we can get from them can be very significant.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.500
And finally, the third mechanism of process change is natural selection.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.500
Natural selection is the understanding that a company produces several products.

39:04.500 --> 39:12.000
A company imports several services to the market, and all these products and services are in demand.

39:12.500 --> 39:21.000
However, there are constant changes, and the demand for some products decreases, and the demand for others increases.

39:21.500 --> 39:30.000
Accordingly, those products and services that are not in demand are removed from production,

39:30.000 --> 39:37.500
and those products that have been recommended are increased in their number.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.500
And then we can make plans for innovation of these products in demand, and adjust the demand for the offer.

39:44.000 --> 39:53.500
This mechanism is called natural selection, because we react to market demands.

39:53.500 --> 39:58.000
What is profitable now, we demand from you.

39:58.500 --> 40:06.000
What is currently in deficit, no matter why, we throw it out to the market at the appropriate price,

40:06.500 --> 40:08.000
at the appropriate advertising company.

40:08.500 --> 40:13.000
When this demand decreases again, we start to throw out another product.

40:13.500 --> 40:22.000
Natural selection is a reaction to those demands, to those market demands that occur and that we implement.

40:24.500 --> 40:32.000
What is the role of natural selection in the development of the company?

40:37.500 --> 40:51.000
When we talked about changes, it was repeatedly emphasized that the level of changes is determined by the way in which these changes are implemented.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.500
This problem was considered by Tuerle.

40:56.000 --> 41:03.500
And as for Tuerle, he proposed to consider five approaches to the management of changes.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.500
Five approaches to how these changes are implemented.

41:09.000 --> 41:18.500
As for these approaches, they are significantly close to the style of management, but there are also nuances.

41:19.500 --> 41:26.000
The first approach that Tuerle considers is a directive or authoritarian one.

41:26.500 --> 41:33.000
The management decided that there should be changes, and accordingly, these changes will occur.

41:33.500 --> 41:39.000
Regardless of whether you like it or not. If you don't like it, leave. But we will work in a new way.

41:39.000 --> 41:56.500
As for this approach, we can achieve rapid innovations, but it does not take into account all the psychological difficulties of a person.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.500
It does not take into account the social and psychological climate in which a person is.

42:04.500 --> 42:08.000
The next approach is a negotiation approach.

42:08.500 --> 42:24.000
Or, as we consider it in the Gruner model, it is the growth of the organization through redistribution of powers, through redistribution of responsibility.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.500
It is admitted that the processes that took place do not lead to the desired result.

42:30.000 --> 42:39.500
It is a kind of contractual agreement that in order for the organization to function normally,

42:40.000 --> 42:45.500
changes are necessary, and these changes are brought to the understanding of the staff.

42:46.500 --> 42:54.000
At the same time, a compromise is reached between what is already there and what will be.

42:54.500 --> 43:01.000
As for the negotiation process, it is designed for cooperative interaction,

43:01.500 --> 43:11.000
when the staff realizes the need for changes, even if the staff does not want them.

43:11.000 --> 43:19.500
Nevertheless, the staff understands and accepts their need and starts to implement these changes.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.500
The next approach is the so-called heart-to-heart.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.500
This approach is associated with the popular concept of emotional leadership.

43:32.500 --> 43:44.000
I can give orders, I can explain, but only if you want changes, if you want other innovations,

43:44.500 --> 43:50.000
if you are interested in the development of your organization, if you are interested in the development of yourself in this organization,

43:50.000 --> 44:04.500
then you yourself should be motivated to implement changes, to form a common vision of these changes.

44:05.000 --> 44:14.500
This approach is based on subjective qualities, on the internal messages of the staff.

44:14.500 --> 44:21.000
This approach has the right to exist in organizations with a good corporate culture,

44:21.500 --> 44:27.000
with a good team, where people really work for a long time.

44:27.500 --> 44:31.000
The next approach for TURL is an analytical approach.

44:31.500 --> 44:37.000
This approach is based on the fact that diagnostics is made on the basis of this diagnostics,

44:37.500 --> 44:43.000
goals are set that need to be achieved, intermediate results are assessed and the next stages are planned.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.500
In fact, this approach is based on control.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.500
At each stage, I control the achievement of goals, I maintain feedback,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.500
I am satisfied with the results of the changes, and I am satisfied with the results of the changes.

44:57.000 --> 45:05.500
In fact, these are programmed changes that are made according to the previously developed plan.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.500
Moreover, diagnostics is carried out at each stage.

45:08.500 --> 45:14.000
What have we achieved? What changes? Are there any improvements? What have we lost?

45:14.500 --> 45:25.000
The fifth approach to changes is the so-called approach to changes based on actions.

45:25.500 --> 45:35.000
In this case, a problem is identified, its solution is formulated, and then we go to its solution by means of tests and errors.

45:36.000 --> 45:45.500
This is the most laborious approach, which can lead to major problems,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.500
but unfortunately, this is the approach that is used most often.

45:50.000 --> 45:56.500
Because, if we talk about Russian reality, it is the hope for Russian avoidance.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.500
So, this is the method of trial and error.

45:59.500 --> 46:02.000
And here something will come out, and here it will not.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.000
And here it is quite difficult to assess any results.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.000
These are the five approaches that CERL highlights.

46:09.500 --> 46:14.000
And these five approaches, in fact, summarize all the variety of methods of changes,

46:14.500 --> 46:19.000
which we talked about earlier, all these models, all the stages that we considered.

46:19.500 --> 46:24.000
When we talk about changes, it is still of great importance to ask the question,

46:24.500 --> 46:28.000
how much is the organization ready for changes?

46:29.000 --> 46:32.500
We are talking about diagnostics, we are talking about planning.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.500
And this is an analysis of the situation as it is, and the situation that we want to achieve.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.500
How much is the organization ready, at the moment, in the conditions as they are,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.500
for the need for changes.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.500
Again, as for the problem of readiness for changes, this is a separate issue,

46:54.500 --> 46:57.000
about which a lot of literature is written.

46:57.500 --> 47:02.000
But since today we are getting acquainted with the common ideas, common plans,

47:02.500 --> 47:05.000
common contexts of approaches to changes,

47:05.500 --> 47:10.000
we will again focus on the practically recommended model of Beckhart,

47:10.500 --> 47:13.000
proposed in 1989.

47:13.500 --> 47:20.000
And as for this model, it is a generalization of those practical successes

47:20.000 --> 47:25.500
and analysis of those failures that were made in practice in the second half of the 20th century.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.500
As for readiness for changes, Beckhart sets several criteria.

47:32.000 --> 47:38.500
First of all, it is the readiness of the top team, the readiness of the top managers

47:39.000 --> 47:40.500
to make changes.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.500
If the top managers are not ready to make changes, the changes will not be made,

47:46.000 --> 47:49.500
because the staff is already responsible for the changes.

47:50.000 --> 47:57.500
And if the managers who manage the company also do not want to make any changes,

47:58.000 --> 48:02.500
then they will have no one to start with, no matter what tasks, no matter what goals they set.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.500
The next criterion is that, as we have already said,

48:07.000 --> 48:11.500
it is necessary to clearly formulate the vision of what the organization should become as a result of the changes.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.500
We do not make changes to the convenience of the manager.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.500
We do not make changes for the sake of changes.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.500
We have a specific goal that is produced by strategic planning.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.500
As for this goal, we must go to it.

48:27.000 --> 48:33.500
If the goal is clearly formulated, then you can clearly understand the steps of achievement,

48:34.000 --> 48:41.500
micro-breaks, or jumps that we will make and which will lead to the desired result.

48:42.500 --> 48:51.000
Another criterion is that it is necessary to create conditions that do not allow the return to the past.

48:51.500 --> 48:56.000
We talked about the situation of defrosting, freezing.

48:56.500 --> 49:01.000
This is what we are talking about in this point.

49:01.500 --> 49:06.000
As it was before, we will not act anymore.

49:06.500 --> 49:11.000
And, accordingly, you should not return to this, you should not think about it.

49:11.500 --> 49:16.000
The next criterion is that the organization has innovators and adapters.

49:16.500 --> 49:19.000
There are not many innovators, but there are many adapters.

49:19.500 --> 49:25.000
Accordingly, there is a certain critical mass of workers who are ready to support the changes.

49:25.500 --> 49:31.000
And there is a certain critical mass of workers who will prevent the changes.

49:31.500 --> 49:37.000
This should be taken into account and supported by those innovators who are there,

49:37.000 --> 49:43.500
because it is these innovators who will be followed by others in the organization of changes in the company,

49:44.000 --> 49:45.500
which we talked about earlier.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.500
The next important criterion is planning for the long-term and medium-term perspective.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.500
Changes are always a strategy.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.500
Tactical and personal goals are a very important stage.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.500
But all these goals that are adjusted to the final goal,

50:03.500 --> 50:12.000
they are implemented depending on the tasks, on the approaches that exist before the organization.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.000
And tactical goals can be changed.

50:14.500 --> 50:17.000
The strategic goal does not change, as we have already emphasized,

50:17.500 --> 50:22.000
for which I make changes, if, of course, I do not hope for 8.

50:22.500 --> 50:29.000
The next important criterion is that you need to clearly report to yourself

50:29.000 --> 50:33.500
that there will always be a negative reaction to any change.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.500
But at the same time, you must respect the opponents.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.500
You will work with these people.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.500
These people are already working for you.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.500
These people help you achieve certain results.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.500
Of course, you can change everyone,

50:50.000 --> 50:57.500
but making changes with a completely changed staff is a much more difficult task,

50:57.500 --> 51:01.000
because you should not forget that changes are a long process.

51:01.500 --> 51:06.000
Nevertheless, the company does not stop its activity in the process of changes.

51:06.500 --> 51:08.000
We still produce something.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.000
These are the laws of the market.

51:10.500 --> 51:13.000
Therefore, you need to know the negative reaction,

51:13.500 --> 51:16.000
and respect the opponents,

51:16.500 --> 51:20.000
because if you have a lot of opponents,

51:20.500 --> 51:24.000
this is only a sign that the preparatory work has not been carried out enough.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.000
And this means that the process of changes is not prepared.

51:27.500 --> 51:36.000
The next criterion is that until the need for changes is realized,

51:36.500 --> 51:40.000
as we have already said, changes will not be made.

51:40.500 --> 51:43.000
We may not accept them.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.000
We may not like them.

51:45.500 --> 51:50.000
But if there is awareness, then the organization is pumped up

51:50.500 --> 51:56.000
and, accordingly, there is an intention to make these changes.

51:57.000 --> 52:04.500
This awareness is a direct way to the conviction that changes should happen.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.500
Because if there are no changes,

52:07.000 --> 52:11.500
the company will not have the ability to function further.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.500
The company is doomed to bankruptcy,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.500
the company is doomed to absorption,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.500
and this means the loss of my jobs.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.500
I will have to look for another job.

52:24.500 --> 52:33.000
At the same time, Becker emphasizes that all changes should use existing resources.

52:33.500 --> 52:37.000
The company's resources are not taken for granted.

52:37.500 --> 52:40.000
Everything that has been developed using the old methods,

52:40.500 --> 52:43.000
everything that has been developed now,

52:43.500 --> 52:46.000
everything that has been diagnosed in the situation as it is,

52:46.500 --> 52:48.000
these are the resources,

52:48.500 --> 52:53.000
and these are the only resources that I can use for further changes.

52:53.500 --> 52:56.000
These resources give me the means to make changes.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.000
These resources give me the prerequisites for changes.

52:59.500 --> 53:04.000
These resources give me the strategic goals and strategic tasks

53:04.500 --> 53:08.000
that I can achieve in the process of changes.

53:09.500 --> 53:13.000
At the same time, it is necessary to remember

53:13.500 --> 53:16.000
that when changes take place,

53:16.500 --> 53:20.000
it is necessary to work extensively.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.500
It is necessary to support information flows

53:24.000 --> 53:27.500
that reflect positive results,

53:28.000 --> 53:32.500
that reflect the real conditions

53:33.000 --> 53:35.500
that exist in the company at the moment.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.500
Accordingly, these are the results,

53:40.000 --> 53:43.500
this is the information support that will help

53:44.000 --> 53:46.500
to form in the consciousness of employees,

53:47.000 --> 53:48.500
in the consciousness of the staff

53:48.500 --> 53:51.000
the fact of the need for changes,

53:51.500 --> 53:56.000
the pumping of staff and subsequent switching of staff

53:56.500 --> 53:58.000
to these changes.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.000
This is what concerns the criteria

54:01.500 --> 54:05.000
in which the results we have discussed today are largely generalized.

54:05.500 --> 54:09.000
When we talk about classification of changes,

54:09.500 --> 54:12.000
when we talk about the mechanisms of these changes,

54:12.500 --> 54:17.000
we still start from the stages of organizational development.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.500
The stages of organizational development

54:21.000 --> 54:25.500
are closely related to the growth of organizational changes.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.500
In fact, they are four main stages

54:31.000 --> 54:36.500
that implement the organizational changes that occur.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.500
We have already talked about these consequences.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.500
Let's summarize and combine all these stages.

54:46.500 --> 54:49.000
When a certain change occurs,

54:49.500 --> 54:52.000
the first thing we face is a denial.

54:52.500 --> 54:58.000
Denial that something needs to be changed in our organization.

54:58.500 --> 55:02.000
There are usual methods of work,

55:02.500 --> 55:05.000
and we start from them

55:05.500 --> 55:10.000
and make a lot of arguments that those schemes,

55:10.500 --> 55:15.000
methods, products, services are so good

55:15.500 --> 55:19.000
that why should we look for something else?

55:19.500 --> 55:21.000
The best is the enemy of the good.

55:21.500 --> 55:26.000
And we deny the need to change something.

55:26.500 --> 55:29.000
But, as we said,

55:29.500 --> 55:34.000
the organizational changes are always initiated from above,

55:34.500 --> 55:38.000
and regardless of our desire, they will be implemented.

55:38.500 --> 55:41.000
Then comes the second stage, the denial.

55:41.000 --> 55:49.500
This stage is that we will change something,

55:50.000 --> 55:56.500
but we will still strive to work according to the old way.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.500
We will strive to make as few changes as possible.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.500
At the same time, we recognize that some changes are really necessary.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.500
But these changes are necessary not in my department's work,

56:09.000 --> 56:10.500
but in the work of the neighboring department.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.500
We work in accounting, finance, lawyers.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.500
But as for my department, my organization,

56:19.000 --> 56:20.500
everything is fine here.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.500
If they changed their attitude,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.500
then we would achieve better results.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.500
We realized that changes will still occur.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.500
But we want to pay the minimum price.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.500
Let others change,

56:36.000 --> 56:39.500
but we will look and work according to the old way.

56:39.500 --> 56:42.000
The third stage is that it is very important

56:42.500 --> 56:47.000
to make the staff accept the need for changes.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.000
And not only this need,

56:49.500 --> 56:54.000
but also the approach that is offered to implement these changes.

56:54.500 --> 56:59.000
This is very important in order to avoid sabotage,

56:59.500 --> 57:07.000
to avoid attempts to devalue the changes in the company.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.500
The third stage is the implementation stage.

57:12.000 --> 57:20.500
The implementation stage is when the staff starts working in a new way.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.500
When changes are accepted, when changes have occurred.

57:25.000 --> 57:31.500
And when changes become something that may or may not be.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.500
When they become necessary, significant,

57:34.500 --> 57:38.000
necessary in the internal part of the operation.

57:38.500 --> 57:42.000
And if I want to work in this company,

57:42.500 --> 57:45.000
if I want to cope with my functional duties,

57:45.500 --> 57:48.000
I have to work in a new way.

57:48.500 --> 57:52.000
Now I can neither deny nor avoid.

57:52.500 --> 57:57.000
Now I have to perform the actions as it is now accepted in the company.

57:57.500 --> 58:03.000
As it happened according to the changes that exist.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.500
This stage, as we have already said, can have two outcomes.

58:10.000 --> 58:17.500
One outcome is when I perform everything as it should be.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.500
But at the same time, all these innovations

58:22.000 --> 58:28.500
are so difficult for a person

58:29.000 --> 58:32.500
that he cannot cope with them.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.500
If there are many people like this,

58:36.000 --> 58:39.500
it is a collapse of organizational development, organizational change.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.500
We did not get what we wanted.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.500
We were left out of the picture.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.500
And the other outcome is when the company

58:48.000 --> 58:50.500
moves to a new level of development,

58:51.000 --> 58:52.500
conquers new markets.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.500
This is what we have been discussing with you,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.500
discussing the Danck model, the Greiner model.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.500
In fact, this is the stage of acceptance of changes.

59:00.500 --> 59:06.000
Now we cannot imagine any other way of working.

59:06.500 --> 59:09.000
This is the stage of passing the point of return.

59:09.500 --> 59:13.000
We cannot return to the old routine methods of work.

59:13.500 --> 59:17.000
Now all these changes are perceived as self-evident.

59:17.500 --> 59:21.000
And then comes the next stage, the fourth stage,

59:21.500 --> 59:23.000
the stage of maintaining changes.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.000
This is a very important stage,

59:25.500 --> 59:29.000
because the task here should be

59:29.000 --> 59:32.500
to make these changes perceived

59:33.000 --> 59:34.500
not only as self-evident,

59:35.000 --> 59:39.500
but also as something that can change.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.500
We adopted some new forms of behavior.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.500
We adopted some new products.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.500
We adopted new systems of interaction, new plans.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.500
And this means that we are going through

59:55.000 --> 59:57.500
a further process of development.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.000
By the way, this is the stage

59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.000
when adapters are the first to be implemented.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.000
Adapters of changes are those people

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.000
who accept the existing processes

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.000
and start polishing them, start working on them.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.000
This is the stage when adapters are very important,

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.000
because there are already some achievements here.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.000
And now these achievements need to be worked out,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.500
they need to be applied to the conditions

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.500
that exist in the organization.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.500
This is the stage of organizational development

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.500
that usually stands out.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.500
And all the models that we are going to look at

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.500
are based on these stages.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.500
Again, when we talk about models of processes of change,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.500
the goal of these models is purely practical.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.500
What methods can be used,

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.000
what actions can be taken

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:58.000
in order to optimize the changes that are taking place.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.000
The first model that gained wide popularity

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.000
was proposed by Kurt Lewin in the middle of the last century.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.000
And this model, again, concerns three main processes.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.000
All these models are simple,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.000
because their main task is to have practical consequences,

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.000
to give practical results, to summarize and analyze practical results,

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.000
and not to create some beautiful theoretical schemes.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.000
Lewin, doing research on the behavior of a person

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.000
and his interaction with other people in the business process,

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:38.000
came to the conclusion that when changes occur in an organization,

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.000
three stages can be highlighted.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.000
The first stage is the defrosting stage.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.000
Lewin uses the usual words, the usual vocabulary,

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.000
because he believes that if I create recommendations

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:54.000
for changes, then these recommendations should be understandable

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.000
to people who do not have a special psychological education.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.000
Kurt Lewin was a famous psychologist.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.000
So, what about defrosting?

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.000
It is a way of informing employees,

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:13.000
informing staff about the changes that will occur.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.000
This is the defrosting of the situation.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.000
We have some problems, we have some difficulties,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.500
we have a stagnation in work, and this does not suit us.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.500
But, first of all, we must accept and recognize that these difficulties exist,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.500
and, secondly, accept and recognize the program of changes

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.500
that will be proposed to eliminate the difficulties that arise.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.500
As for the defrosting stage,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.500
the information should concern all people who will be affected by the changes,

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.000
that is, in fact, all staff.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.000
And, what is very important, we have already talked about this in the Greiner model,

01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:01.000
it is about the fact that it is necessary to give enough time

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.000
for people to realize the need for change,

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.000
to realize the need for the old, successful,

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.000
familiar, recommended way of working to stop bringing the desired result.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.500
The next stage is the second stage, the stage of changes.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.500
In this situation, it is about the fact that the changes themselves occur.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.500
We change the staff schedule, we change the economic indicators,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.500
we change the products, we change the relations, we change the interaction,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.500
we change the business planning.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.500
That is, there is a process of changes that must be accompanied by constant monitoring,

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:48.000
monitoring of what is happening, monitoring of how my changes correspond to external requirements,

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.000
how my changes in the organization are perceived by the staff of the organization.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.000
In fact, this is a control of feedback.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.000
And, finally, the third stage is defrosting.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.000
Defrosting of those new achievements, those innovations that are happening in the organization.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.500
What we talked about earlier, about the support stage,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.500
it reflects the defrosting of the olivine.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.500
We have achieved new results.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.500
These results have proven their success.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.500
These results were accepted by the staff.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.500
These results were realized by the staff.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:33.500
And, accordingly, we will be interested in developing the staff's commitment to these results.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.000
This model was proposed in the middle of the last century, as I said,

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.000
and it turned out to be very successful precisely due to its simplicity.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.000
It does not give specific ways and steps, how and what to do.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.000
Other models were proposed for this.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.000
Some of them we have already considered, others we will consider a little later.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:55.000
But as for the olivine model, it gave a methodology.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.500
A methodology of how we can make changes in the staff

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.500
taking into account the subjective features of a person,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.500
taking into account the tasks that a person has with his acceptance or rejection.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:19.500
30 years of using this model led to the fact that it was improved, corrected by Shine.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:28.000
And it still has all the same elements, defrosting and freezing.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:37.000
But here practical ways have appeared, some operational methods of implementation of actions at each stage.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:45.000
As for defrosting, Shine believes that at this stage it is necessary to realize

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.500
that everything is not going as it should, not as it should be.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.500
The staff must realize that they do not get the desired result.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.500
This should lead to a sense of anxiety.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.500
If we do not get the desired result,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.500
will it not lead to the fact that our competitors will suppress us?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.500
Will it not lead to the fact that we will have to back down?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.000
This sense of anxiety, from Shine's point of view,

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.000
is a very important stimulus to make changes.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.000
I worry about the consequences for myself, I do not want negative consequences for myself.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.000
That is why in order to avoid these negative consequences,

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:35.000
I will be ready to make changes, I will have to make them.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.500
But not because someone demands it from me,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.500
but because I am interested in further work in the company.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.500
But at the same time, any living person wants to get a certain guarantee of his safety.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.500
In the sense that after the changes made, he will not be reduced, he will not be fired.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.500
At least he will not get less than he did before.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.000
If you give these guarantees to a person,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:12.000
then he will be more open to changes, he will be less afraid of them.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.000
Even if something does not work out,

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.000
and we all remember that what concerns a person,

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.000
he always chooses to use the usual methods

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.000
rather than something new that has no consequences for him.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.500
But I have a guarantee that in any case it will not get worse for me.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.500
And so I can take a risk.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.500
Although I can not lose, but I can acquire.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.500
As for the next stage,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.500
unlike Levin, who is concerned with changes,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.500
Schein calls the next stage the stage of movement.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.500
This is the same thing.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.500
But the fact of movement reflects the fact that changes have begun in the organization.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.500
The case has moved from the dead point.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.500
And the fitting of new models of functioning,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.500
new models of behavior begins,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.500
which is very important for the analysis of the inner moving factor, for changes.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.500
I am ready to try on a new model.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.500
And this is the beginning, this is the pumping up of a new way of behavior.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.000
At the same time, when this movement occurs,

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:33.000
there is an active analysis of the external and internal environment.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.000
I look at how other people perceive changes.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.000
I look at their reaction.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.000
I look and decide which group I should join.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:53.000
I am looking for new information that will justify the need for these changes

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.500
and that these changes will not lead to any negative consequences for me.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.500
The third stage is the freezing stage,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.500
which by Schein means the integration of new vision,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.500
new behavior, new reactions, new functioning into the existing relationships within the collective,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.500
into the minds and souls of workers, into the minds and souls of employees.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:24.000
At this stage, the freezing of new forms of behavior occurs.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:30.000
These forms have proven themselves, these forms have justified themselves.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:37.000
And, accordingly, if I use these forms in my work, I will get the desired result.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:46.000
And, of course, this result will lead to the growth of the company indicators in which I work.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.500
Ronald Lipet proposed another model of change,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.500
which is based on the Levin model and on the Schein model,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.500
which is based on the stages of defrosting, changing and freezing.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.500
But at the same time, this model significantly reflects more of the staff's experiences,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:17.000
the experiences that arise among the employees when the process of change occurs.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:24.000
If Levin and Schein are a kind of a constatation of stages

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.000
plus a constatation of the events that occur at each of these stages,

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:36.000
Lipet's model is a list of the stages that are implemented within the collective.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.000
The first stage is shock.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.500
Shock in the sense that what was successful before,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.500
what I could do, how I functioned, turns out to be ineffective.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.500
There are certain or other problems before the company,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.500
and, accordingly, if I do not change, then it is possible that the company will go bankrupt,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.500
it is possible that I will lose my job.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
This is a state of shock when a person is in a hopeless situation.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.000
What was usual and what I can do is not suitable,

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.000
I need to learn something, the result is unknown.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.000
We are talking about organizational change.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:25.000
It is difficult to calculate when and how the desired result will be achieved.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.000
The next stage that follows the shock is retreat.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:36.500
I have not yet accepted the need for change,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.500
but at the same time I am ready to retreat from the usual norms and behaviors,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.500
from the usual functioning.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.500
In this case, the readiness to look for something new is formed.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.000
This is a very important element at the stage of organizational change,

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.000
which we discussed earlier when we looked at the models of these changes.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.000
A person is ready to retreat, but he has not yet retreated.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:12.000
He is ready to retreat, and now the employee is fixing

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:19.000
how much he can accept the changes that are offered to him,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.500
how capable he will be of implementing these changes.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.500
The third stage is the stage of recognition.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.500
When an employee already recognizes that the methods he has learned,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.500
the changes that have occurred are really effective,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.500
that he is able to implement these methods and, accordingly,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.500
successfully implement them,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.500
it means that he is no longer threatened by any negative consequences of the changes.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.000
The next stage is adaptation.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.000
I have adopted new forms of action, they suit me,

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.000
now I have to adapt to them.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:02.000
I have to develop new skills, a new system of document circulation,

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.000
a new system of relations with customers, a new system of interaction with clients.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.000
I have to get used to it, so that it becomes my automatism.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.000
After all this happens, the final stage comes,

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.000
the stage of the change that has actually occurred.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.000
This is what we talked about, for example,

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.000
in the same model of the stage of organizational development.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.000
This is support.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.000
The change has occurred, the change will not fall back.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.000
The change has now become a habit, a way of interaction.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:40.000
This has become a new point, which will then follow the new change.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.000
And here, this whole model returns to its original part.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.500
As for the model of the epithet, this is a more psychological model,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.500
because it includes the psychological characteristics of a person,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.500
his psychological features, his psychological qualities.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.500
And basically, it is oriented and works

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.500
from the point of view of the social-psychological climate

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.500
that exists in the organization,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.500
experiencing these or other processes of organizational changes.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:17.000
When changes occur, consultants play a very important role.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.000
Consultants who consult the situation in the company.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.000
Because if it is about changes, usually,

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:29.000
these changes are carried out by a special team

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.000
that has experience in making changes,

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.000
which has experience in overcoming the difficulties

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.000
that arise in these changes.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.500
And the same Ronald Lippet developed a seven-step consultation model.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.500
If his five-phase model reflects the features

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.500
that arise within the staff of the organization experiencing changes,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.500
this is what concerns the consultation model.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.500
It reflects the interaction of the consultant and the staff of the organization,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.500
the managers of the organization,

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:08.000
in which the system of changes is carried out.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.000
As for the consultation model,

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.000
first of all, it is, of course, an introduction.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:19.000
The consultant must enter the organization

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.000
and start using trust in it.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.000
First, he, of course, uses caution, rejection,

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.000
because this is a person who came to change something,

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.000
and people do not like changes and are afraid of them.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.000
In this regard, the stage of the introduction

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.000
is precisely the establishment of trust relations.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.000
We must get rid of the prejudice of the consultant.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.000
At the next stage, it is necessary to establish

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.000
a client-to-client relationship.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.000
That is, a relationship with the management,

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.000
a relationship with the employees,

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.000
a relationship with the management.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.000
I was given a task, and this task is aimed

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.000
at accompanying the process of change,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.000
to help overcome any difficulties that arise in this process,

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:09.000
and, accordingly, I must work according to certain rules.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.000
The main goal for a consultant is to achieve the end result,

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.000
for which he receives the funds.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.000
But in order to achieve this,

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.000
it is necessary to establish certain business relations,

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.000
business communication with all participants in these changes.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.000
The next stage, as we have already discussed, is the diagnosis.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.000
The diagnosis of what is,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.500
the diagnosis of what should be,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.500
and, accordingly, the determination of the difference

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.500
between what is and what should be.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.500
Is not a deep gap between what is desirable and what is real too high?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.500
Perhaps, in order to achieve the desired result,

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:59.000
gradual steps are required,

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.000
and to avoid too serious shock state,

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.000
requirements are required,

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.000
this is just the same diagnosis that we have discussed in the Bekhart model.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:16.000
The next stage, which we must constantly support when changes occur,

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.000
is, of course, the maintenance of feedback.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.000
Feedback with managers, feedback with managers,

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.000
feedback with staff,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.500
in order to constantly see what attitude to changes exists,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.500
what difficulties arise.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.500
Constant feedback, both internal environment,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.500
and assessment of external changes.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.500
Although consultants are significantly concerned about internal interaction,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.500
because this is a person who carries out internal monitoring of organizational changes,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.500
the need of which is dictated by external conditions.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:59.000
The next stage, after I have established a trust relationship,

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.000
after the diagnosis is carried out,

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.000
after the feedback is carried out,

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.000
it is necessary to develop a project of change.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.000
We have discussed that any change, before it should begin,

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.000
if it is designed to be successful,

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:17.000
it must correspond to a certain strategic plan.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.000
The consultant must develop this plan,

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.000
based on all the data he received,

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.000
based on the relations,

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.000
based on the communication he has,

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:30.000
based on the expectations that are formed in the organization.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:35.000
Only after all this preparatory work is done,

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.000
the very beginning of changes is carried out.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.000
Intervention.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.000
I start doing certain actions,

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.000
I start guiding,

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.000
guiding with new regulations,

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.000
new orders,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.500
new functions.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.500
I start the process of changes.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.500
If you know, the first points are preparation for changes,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.500
what concerns intervention,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.500
it is the actual implementation of these changes.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.500
With all the difficulties we talked about,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.500
with all the processes and stages that were in Levin and O'Shine,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.500
which we considered earlier.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:21.000
The final stage of changes is the assessment of what has happened,

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.000
and adaptation.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.000
Adaptation of the results,

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.000
freezing of these results,

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.000
maintaining of these results.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.000
This is the Leviton model,

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.000
which is based on its five-phase model,

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.000
from the point of view of external consultation

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.000
of the changes that will occur in the organization.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.500
For more information,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.500
you can read the literature that is offered to you.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.500
As you understand,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.500
I have just outlined this model.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.500
Here it is necessary to consider its practical aspects

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.500
and specific practical examples.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.500
As for the changes,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.500
again, the Levin and O'Shine models

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.000
and the Leviton model,

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.000
they are some of the possible models.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.000
At the end of the last century,

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.000
the analysis of the practical results of organizational changes

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.000
allowed to formulate and show

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.000
the practical significance of two more models.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:37.000
The first model is the so-called transition period model.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.500
The transition period model

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.500
that we have already mentioned many times,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.500
means the presence of some breakthroughs.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.500
That is, we are gradually demonstrating

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.500
that the current state has many negative conditions,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.500
and these negative conditions need to be corrected.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.000
Correcting these conditions involves

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:10.000
changing the usual forms of activity.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.000
In this situation, we do not register,

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.000
do not regulate the program of changes immediately,

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.000
we do not make it a leap.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:25.000
As you remember, we talked about the gradual process of change.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.000
We make micro-breakthroughs, micro-changes,

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.000
because a small change

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.500
is relatively easy to make.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.500
As we make these small breakthroughs,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.500
we gradually move from the current state

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.500
to the desired state.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.500
The transition period is important not only for the organization,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.500
but also for the set of necessary changes,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.500
necessary preferences, necessary actions

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.500
that we will use to reach a new level of quality,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.500
the level of organizational change that will occur.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.500
If you look at the slide,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.500
you will see that there is a so-called big gap

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.500
between the current state and the future state.

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:31.000
This gap is not achieved by a leap

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.000
in a short period of time,

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:38.000
but by a gradual step,

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.000
which we use to reach a new state,

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.000
a new position.

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.000
If we make these gradual breakthroughs,

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.000
we cannot return to the old state,

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.000
because we have gradually developed the staff,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.500
new behavior, new actions,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.500
which are useful and which become familiar to me.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.500
I accept them and adapt to them.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.500
However, the organization may not always have time

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.500
to implement this step of gradual improvement

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.500
and to use the transition period model.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.000
The thing is that even these small breakthroughs

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:32.000
can meet the resistance of the staff

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:37.000
and lead to sabotage, to the refusal of changes,

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.000
nostalgia and the need to return

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.000
to the already recommended behavior.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.000
Therefore, along with the transition period model,

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:51.000
there is also a gradual improvement model.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.500
As for this model,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.500
it is mainly used if the management,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.500
the owners, the people who determine the policy of the company

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.500
themselves do not have a clear idea

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.500
of the desired model of the future functioning of the organization.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.500
This situation, unfortunately,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.500
is very often encountered,

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.000
especially in Russia,

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.000
simply because our economic realities

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.000
change so often,

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:33.000
that it is difficult to adapt to the rules of the game.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.000
These rules are constantly changing.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.000
And, accordingly, it is not because I do not know

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.000
what I want to get in the end,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.500
I just do not know what external economic conditions will be,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.500
what external social conditions will exist,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.500
but I know that if I want to exist,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.500
if I want to develop, if I want to function,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.500
I must be ready for these changes,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.500
because I reflect the feedback

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.500
between the market demand and my proposals.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.500
So, if there is no clear model,

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.000
then here you can go through gradual growth,

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.000
which allows you to make changes step by step.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.000
I made some small change,

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.000
I look, it turned out to be useful or not.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:29.000
If this change turned out to be useful,

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.000
I fix it, I adapt it, I fix it,

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.000
I freeze it, I support it and go on.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.000
If this change did not lead to the desired result,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.500
or this change turned out to be excessive,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.500
then you can give up on it and return to the situation

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.500
that was before it.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.500
Since the change was insignificant,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.500
a return is possible here.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.500
The advantage of this model,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.500
the gradual growth model,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.500
is that it significantly reflects the domestic realities,

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:09.000
where you often have to move from one side to the other.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.000
If we really made changes,

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.000
it is difficult to give up on it,

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.000
people are used to it.

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.000
If it is a small change,

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.000
it is relatively easy to give up on it,

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.000
simply because it has a short duration,

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.000
simply because it is not principle and not significant.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.000
But from these inconsistencies,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.500
the desired changes are gradually formed.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.500
In fact, the gradual growth model

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.500
is a simplified version of the transition period model.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.500
The only difference is that in the transition period model

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.500
I have the current state and the desired state.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.500
I clearly know what I want to achieve.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.500
The gradual growth model works in the situation of uncertainty,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.500
characteristic of the Russian specification.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.000
When I find it difficult to say

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:09.000
what specific result I want to achieve.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.000
And in fact, this is a situation of action

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.000
of a gradual trial of errors.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.000
Positive result, negative result.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.000
Should I develop this result or should I give up on it?

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.000
The last model I would like to consider

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.000
from the point of view of control of changes

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.000
is the so-called EZEPO model,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.500
EZEPO is the abbreviation of the letters that are included in it.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.500
The English translation of this is EZEPO.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.500
As for this model,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.500
it is one of the new models

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.500
that has been developed in the early 21st century.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.500
This model is, in fact,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.500
a reflection of the main changes

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:05.000
that occur in an organization under changes.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.000
The functioning of changes begins

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.000
with the creation of a vision.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:16.000
This is what you can see on the slide.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.000
A vision is created.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.000
Again, a vision of what we want to achieve is created.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.000
A vision of what an organization should do is created.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.000
A vision of what place this organization will occupy

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.000
is created.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.000
And accordingly, a goal is set,

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.000
a strategic plan to which we should strive.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:42.000
After this vision is created,

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.000
the activation stage begins.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.000
Management is activated,

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.000
employees are activated,

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.000
consultants appear

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.000
who begin to implement this model,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.500
to achieve an understanding of this model by the staff,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.500
to achieve that people are interested in implementing this model.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.500
As for the model we are considering now,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.500
it is, in fact, a generalization of many of the results we have discussed.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.500
This is a generalization of the Levin model,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.500
this is a generalization of the Shine model,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.500
this is a generalization of the Lipet model,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.500
this is a generalization and maintenance

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.000
of the organizational development stages,

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.000
which we have discussed.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:33.000
The EZE model is another attempt

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:38.000
of practical generalization and graphical representation

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.000
of how we can make changes.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:47.000
There is nothing fundamentally new in it compared to other models,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.500
this model is a functional unity of previously considered models.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.500
This model is very interesting in practice,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.500
very applicable in practice

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.500
and has practical significance.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.500
The next stage after activation is support.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.500
Support for the changes that have occurred.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.500
Support for the processes that exist,

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:18.000
new functions, new divisions,

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.000
new documents of turnover, etc.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:25.000
Support for the changes achieved,

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.000
motivation to continue these changes.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.000
After support, the implementation stage comes.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.000
If at the level of support,

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.000
this is still a significant number of innovators,

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.000
then now the implementation involves

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.500
changing the behavior of a new function

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.500
within the framework of the entire organization.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.500
This is the situation when even adapters

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.500
must make these changes

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.500
and adapt these changes to their everyday actions.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.500
The next stage, and in principle,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.500
usually this stage is implied,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.500
but in this model it is specifically mentioned,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.500
is the provision of conditions for change.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.500
We take care of creating a new corporate culture,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.500
we take care of supporting and encouraging those

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.500
who successfully implement new forms of work,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.500
new forms of interaction.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.500
Accordingly, there are sanctions against those

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:40.000
who sabotage or relate to the changes

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:45.000
that occur in the organization without proper piety,

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.000
without proper desire.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.000
And this whole model ends with recognition

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.000
and approval of the changes.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.000
In fact, in this situation,

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.000
it is about the fact that the changes have already occurred,

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.000
the changes have already been fixed,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.500
the adaptation to them has been made,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.500
and these changes have become a new way of working,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.500
a new way of functioning,

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.500
which allowed to fix and achieve those goals

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.500
for which these changes occurred.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.500
Accordingly, this model is very useful

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.500
because it clearly allows to understand

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.500
the existing connections,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.500
the existing relationships

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.500
between different stages of changes

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.000
and the changes clearly demonstrate

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.000
all these difficulties, all these stages,

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.000
all these processes that occur

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.000
during organizational development

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.000
and organizational change.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.000
Let's summarize our meeting today.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.500
Our interaction was dedicated to the analysis

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.500
of the diversity, the various forms,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.500
the various results of organizational changes.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.500
No company can exist without changing

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.500
if this company wants to develop further

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.500
and wants to take a place in the market.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.500
We have discussed what organizational changes are,

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.000
we have considered the causes of these changes,

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:36.000
we have analyzed the various models of organization growth,

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:41.000
we have discussed what the life cycle of an organization is

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.000
and how different forms of changes

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.000
manifest in this life cycle of an organization,

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.000
we have analyzed the influence of the human factor

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.000
on the organization of changes,

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.000
we have talked about adapters, innovators,

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.000
we have considered different models of changes,

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.000
the Bechert model,

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.000
we have considered the Lipit model,

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:09.000
the Levin model, the Shine model,

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:13.000
we have talked about the transition period model,

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:17.000
the model of gradual increase of changes,

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.000
we have analyzed the IZER model

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.000
as a generalization of those changes

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.000
that occur in an organization.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.000
In conclusion, we have analyzed

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.000
all the models that exist.

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:36.000
Our goal today was to show the whole range of problems

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.000
that exist.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:44.000
And of course, we have only named the main ideas,

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.000
the main working practical models

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:52.000
that are implemented from the point of view of organizational changes.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:57.000
Of course, we have approached the management model of changes

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.500
proposed by Kotor, which is the most popular today.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.500
But as for this model, due to its popularity,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.500
it will be dedicated to a separate topic.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.500
As for the list of literature proposed to you,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.500
there you can find a more detailed description

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.500
of the different models that interested you,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.500
because our goal today was to get acquainted with these models,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.500
analyze their weak and strong sides.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.500
Thank you for your attention.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.500
Goodbye.
