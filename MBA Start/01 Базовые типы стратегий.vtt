00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.540
Hi dear listeners.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.220
My name is Irina Shirochenskaya.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.400
I am a candidate of economics, associate

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.840
professor of marketing of

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.120
the Russian Economic Academy and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.140
Nevelekhanov.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.940
And today we will talk to you about the

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.060
basic types of strategy and sustainable

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.720
strategy of small and medium-sized

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.620
companies.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.960
First we will talk about strategies,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.840
give concepts of strategy,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.160
give concepts of business strategies

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.940
and define types of business strategies.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.680
Next, we will examine certain

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.940
types of strategies, such as portfolio

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.280
strategies, growth strategies,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.100
competitive strategies and conclude

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
our lecture by considering sustainable

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.060
strategies for small and medium-sized

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.220
companies and draw conclusions.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.520
We will look at strategies like

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240
the Boston Consulting Group'

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.860
s Matrix Strategies, McKinsey'

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.720
s Matrix Strategies or General

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.500
Electric, DPM Matrix

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.640
Strategies, or the Direct

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.960
Policy Market.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.360
We will discuss the growth

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.380
strategies.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.100
In growth strategies we will consider

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.440
such strategies as the strategy

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.900
of intensive growth, the ANSOVA matrix

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020
and the ISPAAD strategies, diversification

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.080
strategies, diurnal acquisitions

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300
– net diversification,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.780
convergent acquisitions

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.500
or concentric diversification,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.180
integrative growth

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.520
strategies.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.120
We will consider with you the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.620
types of vertical integration – forward

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.400
and backward, horizontal integration.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.960
Consider the outsourcing acquisition

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620
matrix and the underlying strategies

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.860
that will include cost-

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.180
led domination, differentiation

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580
and concentration

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.240
strategies.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.720
In the cost dominance

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.580
strategy, we will look at

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.880
the strategy of cost-focused,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.860
differential advantage

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.420
strategy, and focused

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.700
differentiation strategy

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.160
in detail, and in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.560
the same section we

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.120
will look at the law

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.160
of experience.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.400
The law of experience will be considered by us

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.840
as a counterweight to the law of scale.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780
The next section of our lecture

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540
will be devoted to competitive strategies.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.300
In this section, we have

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.420
included product leadership strategy,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.040
price leadership strategy, niche

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.160
leadership strategy and also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.740
consider competitive advantage

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.100
matrix strategies, which include

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.260
predictive strategies

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.940
and passive strategies.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.780
The last section of our lecture will be

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.340
devoted to sustainable strategies

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.920
for small and medium-sized companies.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.280
We will look at strategies such as preemptive

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.040
strategies and passive strategies,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.140
as well as the main strategies

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.260
of small – a false fungus, a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.980
wise sandstone, a roaring bee and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.100
a chameleon.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.720
The essence of any

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.100
business, dear listeners,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.240
is the production of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.080
the necessary goods for

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.340
the consumer.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.320
From the relationship between the market

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.740
and the commodity is derived the central

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.180
problem of entrepreneurship, the solution

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.740
of which depends on the guarantee of

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.300
the existence of the enterprise in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.500
this market.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.420
The concept of marketing involves the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.780
use of strategic approaches to solving

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.160
the problems of the enterprise

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.460
in the market.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.120
Marketing mechanisms

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.720
allow this.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.600
By using market information,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.920
forming its consumer,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.400
designing the competitive

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.380
position of the company.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.640
This approach to understanding

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.700
strategies is also used

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.880
in strategic management.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.580
For example, such a concept as a level

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.940
strategy in an organization, the concept

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.420
of a strategic business unit, the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.000
concept of a business portfolio.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.400
And so it must be said that without

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.720
mastering the course of strategic

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.700
management, it is difficult to start

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120
considering the course of strategic marketing.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.940
I am sure you will understand what

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.000
we are going to talk about today.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.580
Although these disciplines of strategic

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.860
management and strategic

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.020
marketing use a similar

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.920
conceptual machine and often

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.420
use similar strategies, it must

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.380
be said that, nevertheless,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.400
today in this lecture we will

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.320
consider strategies from

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.780
a marketing point of view.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.800
So, first, we will start

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.700
with the definition of the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.880
marketing strategy.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.780
What do I see from a marketing strategy?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.200
Marketing strategy is the analysis of the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
opportunities of the enterprise in the market,

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.080
the choice of a system of goals, the development

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.140
and formulation of plans

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.260
and the implementation of marketing

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.720
activities, aimed at reducing market

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.220
risk, ensuring the long-

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.660
term and sustainable development

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.120
of the enterprise.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.820
But if you comment on this definition,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.300
we see that without an analysis of the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.560
capabilities of the enterprise, the company

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.800
will not be able to develop a strategy.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.500
The company then develops a system

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.360
of goals, develops a system

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.500
of strategies and plans.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.580
And, of course, the next step

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.980
will be to develop marketing

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.500
measures that will really

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.980
be aimed at reducing

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.960
risk, because if the company

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960
does not aim to reduce

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.820
market risk, it can

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.040
fail.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.960
And, of course, one of the main goals

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960
of any enterprise is to establish

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.100
a long-term, sustainable development

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.860
of the company in the market.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.600
Marketing strategies do not

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.820
exist individually, but

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.120
are represented in a hierarchy.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.480
In the next slide, we will examine

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.700
the hierarchical representation

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.920
of the strategy.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.020
As you can see, we see three main

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.820
levels in this slide.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.040
This is the corporate level at

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.000
which the company's mission is developed.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.220
The next level of business strategies,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.040
which includes 3 types of strategies,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.680
are portfolio strategies, growth

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.600
strategies and competitive

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.740
strategies.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.480
The next level, lower, is

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.180
the level of functional strategies,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.040
which includes more specific

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.240
strategies such as production,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.040
marketing, financial

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.060
and administrative.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.840
and the next level, it is the level

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.960
of instrumental strategies, which

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.680
are included from the target market

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.500
strategy, product strategies,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.920
price strategies, promotion and

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.100
distribution strategies,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.600
which are responsible, in fact,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.180
for the complex of marketing,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.940
but in this lecture we will stop

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.800
on considering business strategies,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.360
namely portfolio strategies,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.860
growth strategies and competitive

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.520
strategies.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.720
What are business strategies?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.880
Business strategies define ways to

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.440
best use the resources of the enterprise

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.920
to meet the needs and needs

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.360
of the market.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.600
In literature, these strategies

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.620
are often called basic

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.180
or basic strategies.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.640
So, I would like to remind you

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.520
once again that business strategies can

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.620
be presented in the form of

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.020
portfolio strategies, growth strategies

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.800
and competitive strategies.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.600
In today's lecture,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.200
we are strategists.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.960
Let's start with portfolio strategies.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.980
Portfolio strategies are strategies

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.680
that allow you to effectively

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.920
solve the questions with which

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.120
goods or services or their complexes

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.340
the company will enter the

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.740
market and there is a capital

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.380
investment in each of

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.180
the areas.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.380
That is why they are called portfolios.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.580
The fact is that companies usually do not

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.820
produce one product.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.240
They produce several goods

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.640
or several goods and services.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.060
And we must say that, in fact, this

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.260
is the combination of all the goods and

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.580
services of the company and

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.500
is called a portfolio.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.700
These strategies are

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.120
called portfolio

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.320
strategies.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.520
The next type of strategy is

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.640
a growth strategy.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.440
Growth strategies allow us to answer questions

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.340
about the direction in which the enterprise

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.300
should develop in order to

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.840
better meet the requirements

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.280
of the market, as well as questions

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.140
about how to develop the entire

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.540
portfolio of the enterprise

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.140
and also how to develop any unit

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.740
of the portfolio.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.340
Competitive strategies are

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.240
strategies that help an enterprise

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.600
to identify competitive

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.280
advantages.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.220
Naturally, it is clear

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.420
that competition is now

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.180
increasing and companies

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.860
must be able to develop

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.260
strategies to compete

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.840
in the market.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.100
Competitive strategies are designed

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.980
to address these problems.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.790
So, we will go to look at portfolio

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.770
strategies in more detail.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.690
I would like to remind you once

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.030
again that portfolio strategies

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.710
help companies, multi-

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.230
disciplinary companies, that is,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.110
those companies that own a large

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.990
business portfolio consisting

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.890
of many strategic business units,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.690
to distribute limited

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.630
resources between different

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.810
strategic business units.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.670
and use the criteria of

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.410
attractiveness of market segments

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.730
and potential opportunities

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.010
of each business unit.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.370
Now we will consider such

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.730
concepts as a strategic business

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.130
unit, talk about what features

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.850
and characteristics

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.950
a business unit has and

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.730
what a business portfolio

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.070
is, I will show you this on

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.530
examples.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.310
Business unit is an independent

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.730
business unit of the enterprise,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.530
which develops its own strategy

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.250
and is endowed with operational

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.210
independence.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.730
It can be a particular department

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.090
or a single product.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.350
I have to say that at the moment

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.970
with the expansion of business we

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.770
are increasingly meeting with

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.970
such companies that own and

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.510
own many business Indians.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.430
If we take the example of a Russian

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.530
company, the company Wembeldan will

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.410
be a good example.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.030
As you know, the company produces

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.310
a large number of foods,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.730
ranging from juices to

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.790
water, and also dairy products,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.030
and dairy products for children.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.850
All these areas are business units.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.370
If we consider, for example, the

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.510
juice direction, which is represented

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.270
by the very well-known J7 brand,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.670
then it is indeed one of the business

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.370
units of the company.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.370
The second business unit can

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.470
be counted milk products "

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.030
Miracle", the third business unit

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.590
can be considered baby food "

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.470
Aguša" and the like.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.510
And all these business units are

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.870
combined, as I said, into a business

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.590
portfolio.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.390
Therefore, under business portfolio

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.030
we understand the set of companies, goods

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.170
and services produced, which are grouped

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.550
according to developed criteria

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.650
for the purpose of strategic planning

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.210
and management.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.730
Well, first, business-connect produces

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.970
and implements a certain

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.410
investment of goods.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.450
For example, if we look at juice J7,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.970
this brand, then, of course, we see

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.910
that a certain product infrastructure

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.230
is implemented by the company Vemeldan,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.750
that is, it is different types

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.370
of juices - orange, apple,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.730
nectar, and the like.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.610
The second feature of business-

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.750
connecting - it is clearly indicated

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:04.190
to a certain group of goods, such

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.430
as juice, then the segment is

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.130
quite large.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.810
But, nevertheless, we

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.330
can distinguish this

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.050
segment as people who care

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.590
about their health.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.830
Further, the business “Unity” has

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.250
a certain circle of competitors.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.070
And, of course, if we look at this

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.050
brand, then it will have a

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.430
certain range of competitors,

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.310
whether it is juices,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.710
competing companies, or

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.550
other cooling drinks.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.510
A strategic business unit

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.910
must be produced in

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.410
a specific geographical region.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.830
And, indeed, if we look

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.170
at the J7 brand, it is

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.770
made in Russia.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.370
It has its own marketing complex.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.730
Yes, indeed, again, there is a

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.610
complex of marketing, a certain

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.070
product, price, distribution

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.210
and promotion.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.610
And they differ from the marketing

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.010
complexes of other strategic business

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.590
units.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.590
Of course, if we compare the J7 brand with

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.150
the Miracle brand, we will see that the

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.970
marketing complexes are completely different.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.510
Again, and by the product itself,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.630
by its characteristics, by price

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.030
qualities, by distribution

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.610
and promotion policy.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.270
I must say that in simpler organizations

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.930
that engage in one type of activity,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.510
the corporate level may

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.790
coincide with the level

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.410
of business of the units,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.330
but again, now, if we talk

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.990
about modern business,

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.550
such companies are less and

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.110
less.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.690
In conclusion, we would like

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.130
to say that a business unit is often

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.090
called a strategic center.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.150
So, we have considered what

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.170
a business unit and a strategic

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.950
business portfolio is.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.610
Portfolio analysis allows

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.290
to present in a matrix the results

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.890
of research of the areas

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.270
of activity of the

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.370
enterprise in order

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.150
to determine their subsequent

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.330
growth and increase profitability.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.130
So, we will now go to considering

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.130
portfolio strategies.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.270
The first most widely used method

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.190
of portfolio analysis is based on

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.410
the application of the "Growth

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.330
of market share" matrix.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.730
This matrix is known as BCG or

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.030
Boston Consulting Group.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.890
It was developed by the Boston

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.790
Consulting Group and is one of

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.770
the fundamental matrix in marketing

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.110
and management.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.090
The Boston Consulting Group or

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.730
BCC matrix uses two criteria.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.750
This is the growth rate of the target

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.910
segment as an indicator

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.410
of attractiveness and the market

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.450
share relative to the most dangerous

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.730
competitor as an indicator of competitiveness.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.570
This matrix is presented in the form of

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.050
a table, which is divided into 4 squares.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.850
On this slide, dear listeners,

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.670
you see the BKK matrix.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.510
We see here such parameters as the growth

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.650
rate of the market and the relative market

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.350
share.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.490
We have two parameters: high

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:16.790
and low growth rate and also low.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.090
And thus we get when filling

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.490
four squares four main

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.150
strategies, four main

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.010
positions.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.030
It is a question sign or difficult

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.290
children, stars, a cow, a dog or losers.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.410
Thus, we see that the question mark

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.030
corresponds to a relatively small

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.670
market share and a fairly

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.210
high growth rate.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.270
In this situation, the growth rate of

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.390
the cows is decreasing, but the market

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.330
share remains large.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.610
And the losing dogs represent such

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.130
a position as a small market

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.490
share and a low growth rate.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.410
And based on these provisions, we

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.770
can consider the development

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.350
strategies of the company

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.330
or strategic business units.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.190
So, we will now consider

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.630
and analyze all four positions

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.530
of the Boston Consulting

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.150
Group matrix.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.970
Let us start with the question signs.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.170
The question sign is problematic or problematic

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.790
children – characterized by rapid

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.590
growth and a small market share.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.570
Goods and services of this category

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.650
require significant funds to

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.430
sustain growth.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.350
But it must be said that most companies

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.350
that enter the markets or bring

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.490
out new products to existing

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.710
markets, nevertheless, fall into

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.190
this category - the question marks.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.470
In other words, these goods or services

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.670
are characterized by a small market

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.010
share and a fairly rapid pace of development.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.370
But we must say that the signs of the

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.230
question are a rather problematic

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.710
area, a rather problematic position

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.810
of the goods, because the goods are

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.590
in a rather disadvantageous position,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.810
because it can either develop

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.530
and go into a star, or can be

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.810
withdrawn from the market as

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.850
unprofitable, as failed.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.830
And so companies need to

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.270
invest by transferring these

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.090
resources from other areas.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.390
And companies, if they do not

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.090
provide financial support, then immediately

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.550
this product or service can cross

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.930
the area of the dog.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.870
There are two main strategies.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.750
Either increase market share

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.950
or invest in goods.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.890
In other words, stop investing

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.890
and pull it out of the market.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.670
Well, an example of the question

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.890
sign is Donakor, a Donokor product from

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.330
Donon, which is now on the market.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.690
As you can see, there is a fairly

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.610
aggressive advertising company, but

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.190
we can see that the Goods are

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.750
developing rapidly, but it

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.430
still has a small market share.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.930
It is not known how the consumer

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.650
will behave with this product.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.050
It may happen that Danone will be

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.510
forced to withdraw this product from the

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.910
market.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.470
If the development scenario of

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.670
this product is favorable, it

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.110
will move to the next category,

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.350
which we will now consider.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.170
The next category is the stars.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.230
I would like to remind you that this is a rapid

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.150
growth and a high market share.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.330
And, it must be said that if the question

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.230
signs are successful,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.730
then, accordingly, they go into the stars.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.090
Well, I have to say that we now

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.750
see many examples of stars.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.570
This is, for example, many

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.470
Danone products that are in this area.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.670
There are many models of mobile phones.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.050
For example, this is relatively

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.530
the latest on the model of Samsung

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.150
or other brands.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.550
It must be said that these are

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.510
the products-leaders in a fast-growing market.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.150
But if they are not given financial

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.430
support, they can also

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.090
grow into dogs.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.530
Therefore, the best strategy in this

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.010
case will be to provide support,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.130
allocate funds.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.910
And of course, this allocation

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.030
of resource transfer

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.490
or resource relocation comes from

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.050
an area such as the cows.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.670
In fact, they are called so.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.090
The cows are slow growth and high

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.310
proportion.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.430
It must be said that these are goods

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.550
that are in the zenith of their fame.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.670
They can give a lot of money,

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.330
but unfortunately, the market

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.370
share is slowing down.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.910
They are a source of

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.970
funding for other strategic

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.450
business associations that are

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.130
in star positions and question

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.990
marks.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.150
I have to say that if we talk about

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.350
the dog cows, then, for example, if

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.550
you go back to the company of Wimbledon,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.230
then, of course, Soki J7 are

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.150
just the dog cows.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.650
This is a brand that has been on the

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.570
market for a long time.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.370
It already brings a huge

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.430
profit to the company.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.490
And the company redistributes

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.390
resources, transferring those resources

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.710
to other goods and brands.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.450
The priority strategy in this case

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.690
will be harvesting.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.710
In other words, the company will

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.330
not make any special efforts

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.290
to develop any new product

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.710
modifications, to improve,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.510
very strong quality

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.790
improvement.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.310
The company will simply harvest the

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.250
harvest, that is, it will harvest the

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.930
fruits of what has already earned this

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.250
product or service.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.330
These commodities are, of

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.710
course, market leaders, but this position

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.370
is quite vulnerable, because unfortunately,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.610
everything ends and

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.270
the life of the cow cows can

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.710
also end when market share decreases

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.750
and growth also

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.250
decreases.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.150
And then the breast-feeding cows, this

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.430
position, goes to the position of

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.470
the dog or still dead cargo.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.510
This is the most unpleasant position in the market.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.350
The company sees that these products

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.910
are no longer popular among

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.970
consumers, so, in fact, growth

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.850
is slowing.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.010
The products occupy a small market share.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.570
Well, we have to say that these are

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.150
goods that are either obsolete or that

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.350
are no longer necessary for the consumer.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.810
Again, we can give an example of

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.350
various older modifications of mobile

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.770
phones that have been withdrawn

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.550
from the market.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.210
Or, for example, companies

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.470
that constantly modify their

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.910
products, remove from the market

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.030
those models that although still

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.050
good would serve, but for the

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.530
company they are no longer

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.710
strategic priorities.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.790
Therefore, companies will

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.510
use a de-investment strategy

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.770
or withdraw from the market here.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.310
Before investing I wanted to

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.090
remind you, dear colleagues,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.150
the cessation of investing in

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.490
this strategic business unit.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.090
This slide presents the characteristics

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.250
of the PGD matrix products.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.650
This is the conclusion of what

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.290
I just said.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.910
If you look closely, you will

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.890
see that the question mark is

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.110
the starting point of

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.110
most products.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.410
The market has high growth

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.450
rates, sales, financing

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.690
needs, research, low

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.150
profitability due to

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.790
the listed factors.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.710
The star is the leader of a

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.310
growing market, high sales growth

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.690
rate, significant profit and financing needed.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.990
The star usually moves with favorable

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.110
development of events into the

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.730
cow cows.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.970
Doyne cows are the market leader with

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.390
low growth rates.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.830
It is a profitable product.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.770
It brings more revenue than

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.430
it requires, and therefore

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.250
resource redistribution

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.510
to other strategic.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.610
Dines and dogs, or dead cargoes,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.550
are unprofitable, low profitability

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.510
or depletion, so the

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.670
company often preinvests

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.910
this product.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.950
But it must be said that it is sometimes

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.830
a socially significant commodity, so

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.770
companies should be very careful when

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.670
pulling these products out of the

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.290
market.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.810
In the following slide, I presented a

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.430
practical example of the use of

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.390
the Boston Consulting Group matrix.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.670
Sweet Mama is a company that sells

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.330
products for pregnant women.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.570
Sweet style.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.550
See how the products are

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.630
distributed.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.090
Signs of the question are bandages

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.290
and swimsuits for pregnant women.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.130
The stars include jeans, pants,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.130
top clothes.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.530
In a conversation with the company'

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.050
s management, I was told that jeans

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.510
and pants were recently brought

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.890
to market, but they show

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.650
a very good growth rate and

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.450
already occupy a fairly large

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.630
market share.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.830
Doyne cows are pre- and post-

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.330
partum underwear, and in this

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.490
case the company's products

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.010
are very profitable and they

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.470
allow you to redistribute

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.130
funds to other products such as

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.510
swimsuits, jeans and top clothes.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.470
and dogs to dogs relates to cosmetics

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.130
and accessories I was also told that

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.990
it is quite possible that cosmetics

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.490
accessories will be removed from

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.230
the market of this company will

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.490
not stop before producing cosmetics

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.290
and accessories for pregnant

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.990
women and switch to focus on other

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.490
products more relevant to the company

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.050
and so we are Boston consulting groups

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:57.730
and now we will go to the diagnosis

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.970
of the product portfolio we

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.030
need to say what than the price

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.910
of this matrix because it not only

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.270
allows you to see what is

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.710
happening with the company

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.650
as goods and services are

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.590
distributed the company also

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.250
to conduct a portfolio diagnosis

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.550
and identify the future

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.070
development scenario in other

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.010
words strategically track what

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.870
can happen to this product and

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.070
so the company proceed to

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.830
most profitably use the data

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.750
of strategic business-join.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.090
So we see that for the stars

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.430
the best strategy would be

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.130
to maintain leadership by, as

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.550
we have said, funding, redistributing

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.810
funds from the cows.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.070
For dogs, this is a drop from the market

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.350
or low activity in the event that these

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.210
are socially significant goods.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.810
What are socially significant

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.750
goods, I hope, you and very often

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.010
people who buy these socially significant

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.830
goods are from the uninsured

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.070
segments of the population, so

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.390
companies need, I repeat,

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.150
to track their segments very

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.750
clearly and maybe not to pull the

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.990
goods out of the market so

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.410
sharply, but to keep them for

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.690
these segments.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.110
For the signs of the question

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.390
is investment and selective development.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.690
For Philip Kotler, a well-known

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.050
builder, also identified certain

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:33.430
strategies for these positions

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.910
in the Boston Consulting matrix.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.270
It identifies four main strategies

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.530
to build.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.450
The first strategy aims to increase

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.090
market share and even to the detriment

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.650
of short-term income.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.430
In other words, a company

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.510
can donate short-term

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.570
revenues, but thus

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.670
invest in long-term projects.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.690
Well, this strategy, Kotler thinks,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.310
is applicable to question signs.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.350
The next strategy is a

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.730
strategy called by Kotler as “keeping.”

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.610
The aim of this strategy is to

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.330
maintain existing positions.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.190
This strategy is typical for

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.770
the dog cows.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.890
Indeed, what the cows need

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.450
is to hold their positions longer

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.210
and get the maximum profit

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.470
more to be able not only

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.370
to develop data of strategic

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.850
business connections, but

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.030
also to provide resources

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.250
for other strategic

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.670
business connections.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.890
The third strategy defined

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.390
by Kotler is the harvest.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.410
You probably have heard of this strategy.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.410
This is a very typical marketing strategy.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.070
The goal is to increase the

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.670
short-term cash flow, but not to take

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.110
into account the long-term effect.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.530
The harvesting of the harvest implies the decision to withdraw

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.550
the goods from the market.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.910
In other words, the company simply

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.810
collects the harvest, it collects,

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.750
it gets the maximum profit and does

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.990
not invest in research and development,

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.210
quality improvement, and

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.970
the like.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.790
Again, I wanted to say that

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.290
this strategy is typical

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.010
for the cow-dough.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.790
And it can also be used for question

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.730
signs if, in case, if the company

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.190
feels that by bringing the product

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.430
to market in the question mark

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.430
category, it understands that

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.810
it already needs to overturn

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.370
the given strategic business

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.150
to connect.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.070
I can give an example of the brand

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.130
Ivan Similar, which was derived

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.930
by the company, but unfortunately

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.510
it had to overturn this brand,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.770
at least in Moscow, in

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.150
the Moscow region, and in

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.730
this case this strategy was used.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.310
Well, of course, the harvest is

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.650
characteristic of dog positions.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.110
The company already knows that it

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.930
will invest in this product, but

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.810
it simply uses the time to make

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.850
all the loyal consumers

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.470
of this product or brand or service

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.350
use this product, well,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.490
after that it is already pulling

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.710
the product from the

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:10.530
market.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.990
The last one is the

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.410
investment strategy.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.630
The aim is to eliminate business.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.510
The company either sells its business

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.450
or just stops production.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.210
I have to say that Wimeldan

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.770
just wanted to invest in the

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.070
business with the juice direction

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:36.030
to sell the J7 brand, and

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.450
two years ago it just

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.170
considered this brand not

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.750
only a cow, but also just a dog.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.510
He wanted to negotiate the

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.650
sale of this business.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.050
But as you can see, analysts from the

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.870
company's top management considered

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.710
this a disproportionate step.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.930
And now we see that this brand

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.410
has moved back into the position

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.950
of the cow, and the company

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.330
offers efforts to improve

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.990
the quality and modify this

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.710
product.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.370
Therefore, it may happen that this

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.930
commodity will pass from

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.630
a native cow to a star.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.990
These are possible developments.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.330
And, as I said, we can also, by

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.350
analyzing the position of the company

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.310
and its strategic business

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.130
units, develop a future

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.710
development scenario.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.610
Here is what the price of this matrix

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.110
is, and build trajectories that can

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.530
be observed in the dynamic portfolio

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.430
analysis.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.750
Two trajectories we are looking at now

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.330
can be considered successful,

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.690
and two, unfortunately, are not.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.190
Trajectory of the Innovator.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.110
Investing in neocr or research and

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.010
development, a tool that comes from the

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.470
dog cows, the company brings a

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.070
new product to the market, and it goes

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.550
under the category of a question mark,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.390
but the company assumes that

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.670
it will take the position

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.350
of the star.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:10.270
In other words, it is a trajectory from the

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.470
dog cows to the signs of question and the stars.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.210
Trajectory of the follower.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.930
This, again, using the resources of

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.190
the cow cows, the company introduces

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.110
the market product on the mark of question,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.530
where the leader dominates, explores

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.350
aggressive strategies.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.210
For example, the company is a network of restaurants

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.270
“Matröška” and “Yelki-pali”.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.590
The company “Yelky-paly” was the

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:40.750
leader in this sector.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.410
The company brought a new restaurant

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.970
"Matröška" to the market and used

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.410
this trajectory consistently.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.310
In other words, she

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.350
redistributed her funds from the dog

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.450
cow attempted to fund the

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.610
question mark in order for this

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.370
category to move into the star

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.110
category, what he did and what

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.110
he managed.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.110
Two other trajectories.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.150
As I said, the trajectories are

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.470
not very positive.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.990
The trajectory of a loser occurs

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.910
when, as a result of insufficient

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.810
or unthoughtful investment,

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.330
the star arranges its

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.970
position and goes

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.210
into question.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.950
In other words, we see that there is

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.750
a reverse movement and it can happen

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.230
that the question sign will go to

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.010
the dog.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:33.750
The next trajectory is

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.790
the trajectory of permanent mediocrity.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.230
The question sign he fails to increase

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.910
his market share and he immediately

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.130
moves into the position of dogs.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.150
In other words, summarizing the analysis

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.910
of this matrix, we see that the Boston

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.350
Consulting Group matrix allows us

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.690
not only to determine the position of

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.970
the strategic business of the company

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.530
or the entire business, or some

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.510
individual product on the market,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.370
but also to identify development

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.350
strategies, view development

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.250
trajectories and determine future

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.470
scenarios.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.010
Companies, of course, use this matrix

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.830
and determine, of course, how

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.050
they will further develop

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.150
their products and their

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.310
strategic business units.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.030
And with the proper management

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.030
of this matrix, the company

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.590
gets benefits, because it clearly

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.190
understands what resources

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.730
and where it needs to move,

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.890
and move to what areas, and

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.430
what strategic business units.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.470
I must say that the matrix

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.270
allows you to analyze on two indicators,

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.710
but this is not always enough.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.950
For the multicriteria

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.310
assessment, another matrix

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.130
is used, which is called

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.310
General Electric

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.650
or McKinsey.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.490
Why is it a double name?

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.570
Because two companies, General

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.810
Electric and McKinsey, developed

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.830
the matrix simultaneously,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.090
so it is dubbed.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.890
It is used to assess the attractiveness

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.130
of individual strategic business

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.550
units and the entire business

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.690
on the basis of two coordinates.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.990
The X axis, which characterizes the strength

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.290
of the strategic business position of the

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.010
unit, and the Y axis, is the

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.410
attractiveness of the industry.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.890
Each coordinate is determined

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.770
by several parameters.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.070
What are the parameters?

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.630
This is the index of strength of

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.190
position, it is determined taking into

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.150
account the indicators of relative

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.230
market share, dynamics of development,

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.190
the size of profit, image, degree

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.830
of competitiveness, price, quality

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.570
of goods, efficiency of sales,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.390
geographical advantages of the

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.430
market, efficiency of employees.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.250
That is, we see that the strength

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.910
position index considers

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.010
marketing components.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.490
This, again, is the market share, external

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.590
indicators, the amount of profit

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.050
received, but also internal positions.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.250
This is the effectiveness of the

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.250
work of the personnel, this is the efficiency

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.770
of the domestic policy, this is the competitiveness,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.730
this is the quality, this is the price

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.730
policy of the company, and the index

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:18.070
of strength and position is adopted three

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.230
levels of gradation, the index is a,

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.810
medium and weak.

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:25.050
The next index is the attractiveness index.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.110
It is determined by taking into account the

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.230
size and diversity of markets, the

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.230
growth rate of the market, the number

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.650
of competitors, the average industry

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.550
size of profit, the cyclicity of demand,

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.990
the number of competitors,

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.630
the structure of atmospheric costs,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.890
price policy, legislation,

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.070
labor resources.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.810
And also three levels of gradation

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.190
of this index are used, high, medium

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.830
and low.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:48.870
In other words, when combining these

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.030
two indices, as I said, it is the

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.470
index of position of strength and

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.930
the index of attractiveness, we

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:59.290
get such a matrix, which includes

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.970
itself unlike the Boston Consulting

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.570
matrix not 4 cells, but already

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.270
9.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.750
And we see here the attractiveness of the

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.670
industry and the strength of market

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.650
positions, the high, medium and

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.590
low market attractiveness, and also

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.730
the position of business power high,

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.470
medium and low, and we get 9 strategies.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.990
This is investment and growth,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.350
investment and growth, selectivity,

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.330
investment and growth, selectivity,

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.010
harvest harvest, market removal,

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.210
selectivity, harvest

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:29.790
collection, market removal, harvest

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.930
collection, market removal.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.390
You may ask me what the difference

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.510
is.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.370
Of course, each of the strategies

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.630
in different positions

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.210
has certain advantages and

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.590
some certain characteristics.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:44.610
Therefore, it can be said that investment

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.110
and growth in position 1, when the market

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.710
attractiveness is high and high,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.230
also the strength of the business,

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.910
is different from the selectivity

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.890
in square 5, which is characterized

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.110
by the average industry attractiveness

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.850
and the average position

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.710
of the business force.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.030
Let us look at these strategies in more detail.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.970
Speaking of square 1, we can

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.050
say that the company must maintain

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.510
and simplify its market positions

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.970
by investing and ensuring

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.430
growth at the fastest

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:19.810
possible pace.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.650
In this case, we can compare this with

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:28.310
the BQG matrix, with the first

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.350
square is a question sign.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.790
Also, the company in this strategy

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.090
should concentrate efforts onining

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.950
the strengths of the business.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.590
The second square, which is called

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.390
Investing and Growth, a company

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.270
must apply such a strategy, investing

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.610
in the struggle for leadership,

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.310
selective investment

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.990
and business strengths.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.430
In these words, the company chooses

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.150
some strengths, strong brands

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.930
and invests in them.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.890
They spread on all their products.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.830
Strengthening the most vulnerable

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.750
sides.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.550
In this case, Wimbledon has

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.310
focused its efforts on strengthening

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.110
its vulnerabilities and realized

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.190
that it will not withdraw its

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.870
J7 brand from the market.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.350
The third square is to ensure selective

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.390
growth through specialization

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.910
based on the strengths of

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.850
the activity.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.490
In other words, the company

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.490
specializes in its activities,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.750
it produces some particular

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.490
product with certain characteristics.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.850
We will talk about the specialization

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.810
strategy further, so I will

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.690
not stop in detail now

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.510
on this, and let's go further.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.350
The company must also find

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:52.850
ways to overcome its weaknesses

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.150
and the company may leave

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.570
the market if there

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.070
is no indication of acceptable

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.190
sales growth.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.530
The fourth is growth

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.890
and investment.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.210
The company in this case must

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.870
carry out large investments in

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.570
the most attractive market segments,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.830
ining the ability to counteract

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.530
competitors, to ensure

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.250
high profitability by increasing

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.670
productivity.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.910
Well, if we compare this approach

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.070
to the Boston-Consoldskaya

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.410
matrix, we will see that this fourth

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.230
position, the fourth strategy,

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.050
is similar to the star

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.050
strategy.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.630
But we cannot make such direct

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.910
analogues; we can make,

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.510
so to speak, such indirect

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.850
analogues.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.010
The fifth position is the protection

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.710
of existing programmes of market

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.850
activity, concentration of

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.590
investments in segments where

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.630
the suitability is quite high,

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.510
and the risk is relatively low.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.370
In other words, the company is already

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.510
in the fifth square, when we have

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.590
an average attractiveness, the average

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.670
strength of the business position

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.610
is trying to somehow hold its positions.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.690
The sixth strategy is

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:12.050
to keep the harvest.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.410
In other words, the company

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.590
must limit the expansion

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.830
of its activities and ensure

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.710
the harvest that occurs by finding

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.390
ways to expand activities

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:26.890
that are not high-

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.690
risk.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.610
In other words, the company

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.190
either modifies the goods,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.090
or it starts buying licenses,

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.790
producing goods under license.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.210
In other words, it does not completely

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.590
leave the market, but it slows down

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.390
its activity in this segment,

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.890
in this strategic business unit, and

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.910
prepares this product for withdrawal

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.250
from the market.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.630
The seventh position, which

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:59.050
can be called Selectivity, we see

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.430
here quite not a profitable

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.070
position, it is low attractiveness,

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.970
but high business strength.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:05.850


00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.350
There is preservation of position

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.450
and re-cassing of activity by moving

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.510
the focus on earning

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.810
current money, concentration

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.970
on attractive segments, protection

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.530
of strengths of activity.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.150
The last two strategies.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.610
This is the eighth position, with

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.470
the main focus being on making money

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.890
by protecting positions in the most

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.630
profitable segments.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.030
In this case, we can compare this

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.770
to a cow-doo, upgrading the product

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.170
line and minimizing investments.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.230
The ninth position is the harvest collection

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.730
and the withdrawal from the market.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.650
At the same time, it is necessary

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.870
to sell goods at a favorable price in

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.450
time and dramatically reduce

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:51.790
constant costs, while avoiding investment.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.030


00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.250
I show that matrix again.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.090
You see, it compared to the

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.350
BCH matrix has on the one hand

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.010
more detail, but on the other hand

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.530
it is quite bulky and uncomfortable

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:08.350
when analysed.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.290
And in this case, companies,

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.390
avoiding this bullshit, developed

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:17.950
some other approaches.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.870
There are many approaches to the Boston

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.430
Consulting matrix analysis now, and

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.950
I will give you an example of

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.690
the McKinsey matrix analysis

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.390
by Jacques Jean Lambert, a well-

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.430
known theorist and practitioner

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.070
of marketing and management

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.730
who interprets this matrix

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.010
a little differently.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.470
As you can see, here we also

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.230
see nine positions –

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.810
industry attractiveness

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:50.230
and competitiveness, 3 grades,

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.810
high, medium and low.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.310
But nevertheless, unlike the

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.250
previous analysis, we see here

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.950
4 squares filled.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.050
This is a, de-investment, b,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.070
selective growth, c, aggressive

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.530
growth, and d, low activity.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.930
We are characterized by low

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.210
attractiveness and high competitiveness.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.610
Selective growth

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.950
is characterized by

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.550
high attractiveness and high competitiveness.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:20.570
C is low competitiveness and

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.150
high attractiveness, and D

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.730
is low competitiveness and

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.150
low attractiveness.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.650
Let us look at these areas in more detail.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.430
Zone C corresponds to the high

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.130
levels of market attractiveness,

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.350
as I said, and the competitiveness

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:38.970
of the firm.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.470
And the strategy recommended

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.630
by Jacques Jean Lomben is aggressive

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.370
growth.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.870
If we compare it with the BCH matrix,

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.410
in this case it is more legitimate to

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.910
do so, we will see that this zone

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.970
C can be compared by analogy

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.790
with the stars in the BCH matrix.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.750
Zone A, which is characterized

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.510
by fairly high competitiveness

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.410
and low attractiveness,

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.310
is at a fairly low level and

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.090
the best strategy would be

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.310
to continue operations

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.770
without investing or de-investing.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.550
In this case, we can compare this

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.730
strategy to the position of dogs.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.250
Zone B is intermediate.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.350
The competitive advantage, as you can

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.570
see, is rather weak, but the

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.710
market attractiveness is great.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.910
And therefore, the strategy chosen

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.590
by Lamben is selective growth.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.150
In other words, the company selectively

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.390
suits strategic

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.330
business units, so we can

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.570
make an analogy here with a question

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.310
sign.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.670
And Zone D is a very unpleasant

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.710
situation when we have low activity,

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.290
in other words, we have low competitiveness

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:55.550
and low attractiveness, and

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.310
Jacques Jean Lamben also advises

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.290
companies to pre-invest

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.510
this strategic

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.630
Well, if we compare

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:10.090
with the BKG matrix, we

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.750
can say that it is

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.990
either a cow or already

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.150
a dog.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:21.130
So, we have considered with you the second

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.070
matrix that is included in

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.310
portfolio analysis – it is the McKinsey

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:28.050
matrix or Boston Consulting Group.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.270
There are still some matrix,

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.770
and we will stop at the

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.710
last portfolio analysis matrix,

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.110
which is called Shell or

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.250
DPM, Direct Policy Matrix,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.030
in Russian it is a matrix

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.650
of direct activity.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.150
I have to say that this matrix is

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.270
quite rarely used by the company

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.990
because of the fact that it

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.870
is really quite uncomfortable to use.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:56.970
But despite its disadvantages,

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.230
it has an

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.410
advantage.

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.030
In this matrix, the emphasis is placed

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.530
on quantitative business indicators.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.850
If in the BQG matrix we are interested

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.810
in cash flow, and you remember that

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.450
we have always talked about real-location,

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.930
that is, the transfer of resources

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.850
from one position to another,

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.410
in General Electric we consider

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.390
investments, investment returns,

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:21.950
then this model combines these

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.210
two positive points and allows

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.790
you to keep the focus at the same

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.590
time on the flow on the personality

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.170
and on the company's

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.110
strategic decisions on investment

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.690
returns.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.370
Thus, this matrix can be represented

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.830
as a four-field matrix, it

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.110
can be represented as a

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.730
nine-field matrix.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.430
The basic ideas of the DPM matrix,

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.330
borrowed from the Boston Consulting

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.250
Group matrix, are that the company'

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.670
s overall strategy should ensure

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.310
the maintenance of a balance between

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.890
cash surpluses and its deficits,

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.530
by regular development of new

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.330
prospective types of business, the

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.250
redistribution of certain

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.810
financial flows from business areas

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:03.110
generating money in business

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.010
areas with high potential for

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.330
return on investment

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.570
in the future.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.610
Thus we represent the DPM matrix,

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.990
in this case it is a four-field matrix,

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.210
we see two indicators of the market

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.710
attractiveness and

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.810
the strength of the business

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:19.870
position.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.290
Quiti is a mixture of the two

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.290
previous matrix.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:28.450
Again, two positions are high and

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.630
strong and four strategies.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.610
Development strategy, growth strategy,

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.450
maintenance strategy and reduction

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:35.650
strategy.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.970
Dear listeners, I will not

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.530
stop in detail on these

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.150
strategies, because we have

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.370
considered almost all of

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.730
them in the previous matrix,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.070
namely the Boston Consulting

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:53.650
and the MacKinsey or General

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.310
Electric matrix.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.150
In conclusion of this section, I would

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.950
like to say about the usefulness of

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.470
portfolio analysis.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:02.650
Portfolio analysis is the completion

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.090
of a specific specification

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.150
of the strategic

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.350
marketing process.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.710
And indeed, when a company at the

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.190
strategic level develops

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.630
some of its developments,

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.050
ways of development, matrix

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.410
analysis is sufficient and visible

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.290
and useful.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:24.510
And regardless of the method

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.270
used, this analysis is based on

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.950
such parameters as a clear distribution

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.510
of the areas of activity

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.550
by markets or segments.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.610
Indeed, both the Boston Consulting

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.890
and General Electric matrix and the

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.130
latter matrix look at the direction

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.750
of development of certain strategic

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.970
business units by segments and

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:51.130
by commodities, and we also look

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.390
at a clear distribution of activities

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.530
and directions of

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.290
investments.

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.310
Portfolio analysis helps us to

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.630
identify the competitiveness

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.350
and attractiveness indicator

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.930
that allows us to compare

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.910
the strategic

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.650
value of different directions.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.510
As you can see, most positions,

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.430
most parameters of the Matrix

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.710
contained indicators, or

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.250
competitiveness, or attractiveness,

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.670
or growth, and the

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.290
like.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.950
And indeed, this allows us to compare

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.910
strategic value and understand

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:28.990
how resources are redistributed.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.530
Portfolio analysis also helps us

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.170
to identify the links between

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.750
strategic position and

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.910
economic and financial indicators.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.090
This is evident in the Boston

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.330
Consulting Group matrix.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.190
Also, the matrix representation

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.910
allows to summarize the results

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.110
of strategic thinking and

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.450
present them in a visual form.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.650
Of course, it's quite obvious that

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.070
when a company's analysts present

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.310
their strategic layouts in the form

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.050
of matrix, the company'

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.190
s management becomes clear on

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.530
how to develop their business.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.470
And I hope that by the example of these

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.810
three matrix and by the example of Swidmam,

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.690
Swidmam, we could be convinced

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:18.190
of the undeniability of this statement.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.580
Now I would like to go to the second

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.820
part of our lecture, namely,

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.760
growth strategies.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.680
I wanted to remind you, dear colleagues,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.640
that we are considering in today'

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.060
s lecture business strategies,

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.400
which includes the portfolio

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.280
analysis we have just considered,

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.900
growth strategies and competitive

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.140
strategies.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.300
Thus, the growth strategies

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.800
What do they imagine?

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.580
The growth of the company is

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.780
a manifestation of its activities.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.160
Of course, when a company is

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.340
just formed, it is beginning

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.360
to grow.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:10.800
Someone...

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.200
Some companies grow within the

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.100
local markets, some companies

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.020
leave the local markets

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.340
and become national.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.960
Some companies are moving

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.920
from national to international.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.560
The transformation of international

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.420
companies into transnational

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.480
corporations.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.000
This is a completely natural

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.560
process of development, all these

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.240
transformations are dictated

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.260
by the growth of the company well

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.360
from a growing company we can call

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.060
companies such as laboratory cospersky

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.660
this is a company that shows

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.040
quite fast and very successful

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.180
growth again I can not fail to

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.540
mention the company Wimbledon

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.560
company Baltimore which produces

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.460
various ketchup sauce

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.180
and mayonnaise is also

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.800
a fast-growing company.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.560
There are many examples of companies

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.720
that are developing in the markets.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.280
And, of course, if we look at

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.020
transnational companies, we will

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.680
see that, of course, they do

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.980
not stop in their growth, but

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.540
continue to grow and enter new

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.000
and new markets.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.640
All the companies that have

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.980
come to Russia are transnational,

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.240
they continue to develop

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.180
in Russia.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.400
For example, the company L'Réal,

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.520
it is, as we see, continuing to grow.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.940
Danone, which is also a transnational

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.300
company, is continuing

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.380
to grow in new geographical

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.940
markets.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.120
It must be said that business

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.780
activity or growth of a company can

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.940
be based on three opportunities.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.360
The first is organic growth or intensive

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.180
development at the expense

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.020
of own funds.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.080
In other words, the company

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.780
does not borrow funds and uses

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:58.780
its own resources.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.920
And already known to you, Jean-Jacques

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.140
Lambert calls this condition intense

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.040
growth, that is, companies

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.940
are developing intensively or

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.840
growth within the base market.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.560
Well, in addition to this possibility,

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.840
there is another type of growth, namely,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.940
the company acquires other companies

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.960
and integrates these companies

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.420
into its company.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.480
In other words, the process of integration.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.880
We will talk very detailed about

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.720
integration, but we must say that the

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.440
different types of integration, such

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.060
as integration forward, integration back,

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.860
vertical integration, horizontal integration,

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.700
and all these types of integration,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.340
they differ from each other,

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.500
but the main point, the main

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.200
emphasis is made on the fact that

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.120
the company joins other companies

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.360
and expands and grows at the

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.520
expense of not its internal development,

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.440
but at the expense of other

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.280
companies.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.460
The third possible growth is so-

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.940
called diversification.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.740
The company believes that it is possible

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.680
not only to join some other companies,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.580
but simply it understands that

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:05.720
it can develop in other

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.860
types of business, in other

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.600
areas of business, and it goes to

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.580
other areas of business that

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.720
are not directly related to

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.400
the direction of the business

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.560
of a particular company.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.920
This is actually diversification.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.180
So, I wanted growth strategies

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.760
there are three possible ways.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.780
This is growth within the limits of own

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.940
resources, in other words, it is

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.320
organic growth, it is integration, the accession

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.000
of other companies, and it is diversification,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.440
the company's transfer to other

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.640
areas.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.720
Growth strategies include strategies

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.840
such as strategies that are part

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.860
of the Amsov matrix.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.120
Another matrix, during this

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.700
lecture we will have a lot

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.660
of matrix with you that we

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.760
will consider.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.740
SPADA strategies, which are a modification

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.660
of the Antsov matrix or, as one

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.800
might say, a mirror reflection

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.820
of the Antsov matrix.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.720
The Matrix of External Acquisitions,

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.620
the new Boston Consulting Group Matrix

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.680
and also the basic strategies for the definition

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.120
of Jacques Jean Lambent.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.980
So, let's go to the Antsov matrix.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.960
The Antsov Matrix, named after

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.880
the American researcher Igor Antsov

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.860
of Russian origin,

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.620
allows you to use several

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.380
strategies of intensive

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.360
growth at the same

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.720
time and to analyze them.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.780
It is a tool for classifying products

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.780
in different markets depending

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.000
on the degree of uncertainty

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.460
of prospects and the

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.040
possibility of penetration

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.640
into other markets.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.880
It also allows for the development

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.800
of growth strategies.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.220
Antsov has developed a very good

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.700
strategy, a very good matrix,

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.280
which is used by most companies.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.300
It is called the product development

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.580
matrix.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.700
It is also a four-

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.100
band matrix.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.380
In this case, we have two parameters.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.140
products and markets.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.800
Products can be existing

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.720
or new.

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.140
Markets can be existing or new.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.640
And depending on which products,

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.760
in which markets we see,

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.540
we can highlight, here

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.360
are four strategies.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.320
So, the products available

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.420
on the markets define the

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.640
penetration strategy, or penetration

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.440
strategy in English.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.200
In new markets available products,

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.700
they can apply the strategy,

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.920
the strategy of market development.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.160
When we talk about new products in

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.580
existing markets, it is a product

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.480
development strategy or product development.

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.220
And last, when it comes to new products

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.180
and new markets, a strategy of diversification.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.800
You see, these strategies really determine

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.000
the ratio of goods and markets, and

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.120
we will look at and consider these

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.640
strategies in detail on

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.760
examples from the company's

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.620
life, so to speak.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.860
Market penetration strategy is a

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.100
strategy that is used

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.620
when the market is still growing,

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.080
it is not yet saturated,

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:17.200
and the company uses existing

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.900
goods in existing markets.

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.820
What does the company do?

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.060
The company is trying to expand its

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:30.420
presence, improve its course,

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.400
and build distribution channels.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.300
I think a lot of companies

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.340
are using this strategy.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.640
I will lead the company Rotfront,

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.960
which produces candy and chocolate

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.240
products.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.200
A lot of Rothfront products,

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.060
they just use the penetration

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.460
strategy.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.180
In other words, we see existing

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.520
products, candy or halva that

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.980
is famous for Rotfront.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.260
These are products that have long existed

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.060
in existing markets.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.160
What does the company?

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.400
But first of all, it is trying to

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.040
expand sales.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.160
And, indeed, it must be said

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.480
that Roadfront has used

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.220
different distribution channels.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.800
It has a direct channel, for

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.260
example, this store at

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.340
the company, at the factory Roadfront.

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.100
These are traditional channels, in other

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.940
words, it is the distribution of goods to

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.560
the trading points through intermediaries.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.940
The company also uses

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.840
a vertical marketing system,

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.340
that is, it has built such

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.700
a channel and uses

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.620
some franchising channels

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.100
to advance to and other positions

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.480
in the markets.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.560
I have to say that the company

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.500
is very widely represented, that is,

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.240
you can go to any store that was

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.660
sold in the store and see there

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.020
the products of the company Road

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.060
or, if you go to the market, you

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.020
will also see the company RedFront.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.020
I must say that the penetration

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.860
strategy is typical

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:02.700
for food.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.060
For example, Mayonnaise Kid Provençal or

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.040
Mayonnaise F, is also a strategy

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.700
of penetration into the market.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.600
The company is trying to simplify

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.940
the situation by expanding its distribution

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.520
channels, and of course, its outbound

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.660
policy, not only outbound policy,

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.100
but also pricing and promotion

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.060
policy.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.780
Well, this strategy has one

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:34.200
disadvantage, it is very expensive,

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.720
because companies need to keep

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.800
their competitive advantage,

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.660
and, of course, the company

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.780
can not always maintain the data

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.640
of existing goods on the

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.900
existing market, because

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.620
other companies come out with

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.500
completely new products.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.540
Therefore, the company is forced

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.960
to modify the product itself or

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.600
the marketing complex in some

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.140
way, and what is it about?

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.060
Packaging or promotion.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.420
This is mainly about promotion,

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.960
packaging and sometimes pricing.

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:05.900
The next strategy is the market

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.260
development strategy.

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.280
It involves finding new

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.000
markets for existing products.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.980
Well, if we look at this widely,

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.160
we will see that all companies

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.600
that come to foreign markets

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.120
benefit from this

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.060
strategy.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.680
Take Japanese companies

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.060
for example.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.240
Japanese companies have

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.540
used this strategy to enter

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.060
new markets.

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.040
What did they do?

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:39.000
They first tested the product on

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.600
their own consumers in Japan.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.520
If it went well, sold well, they

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.380
started to go into new markets,

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.920
which is behind the existing product,

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.240
and with the base model.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.760
This is for example

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.940
the automotive industry.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.680
They came out of the basic model

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.800
of the existing, of course, goods,

00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.900
and gradually won their positions

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.480
in new markets by providing

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.160
very good products of

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.260
high quality, not such

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.260
high prices and very good

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.640
after-sales service.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.660
Well, we have to say that in addition

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.880
to Japanese companies, we can take the example

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.680
of Johnson's Baby - it is the development

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.880
of new markets.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.780
What is it?

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.020
This is not just new geographical markets,

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.360
but it is a new application.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.020
Johnson's Baby is a baby product

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.180
for newborns.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.160
But the company decided to expand

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.380
its presence in the market

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.860
and repositioned products not

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.140
only for newborns but also for

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.240
women.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.780
It was assumed that these

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.980
newborns were a MAM, but also

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.400
now many women use Johnson's

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.600
Baby products to moisturize

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.140
the skin.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.200
And as you know, the company

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.720
promotes these products for

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.660
women and says that the skin will

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.740
be like a baby.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.820
This strategy is represented

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.300
by a very wide range of goods

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.520
and services, because, I repeat,

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.120
all foreign companies that enter

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.920
foreign markets, well, and,

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.160
in particular, the Russian

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.240
market, used this strategy,

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.380
because it is the least

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.100
expensive and not so risky,

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.860
that is, go out with the

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.820
already existing product.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.080
If the foreign market accepts the

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.000
product, you can already start

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.920
modifications, but if it does not,

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.420
you leave with the already

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.880
existing product.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.080
Again, entering new geographical

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.240
markets, repositioning

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.460
– this is also all these marketing

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.620
actions relate to the strategy

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.780
of market development.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.980
The next strategy is product

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.420
development strategy.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.960
It involves the development,

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.340
production and sale of new

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.780
products in existing markets.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.900
It should be noted here what is a

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.540
new product.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.600
New product – the concept of a product

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.680
– is a very blurred concept in marketing.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.580
The new product can also be understood as a new

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.260
packaging, a modification of the product and

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.300
a new packaging of the product.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.160
You can also accept completely

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.760
new products, as the English

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.780
say brand new.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.760
But we have to say that completely

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.600
new products, if we look at the history

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.200
of marketing in general, we will

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.620
not find a lot of really new

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.200
products.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.800
But new products, it is at one

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.960
time computers, it is at one

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.680
time mobile phones, it is at

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.280
one time the Internet, it is

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.420
at one time IP-telephony and

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.240
the like, now they are not new

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.600
products, so companies

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.700
are all the time trying

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.000
to modify existing

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.260
goods, modify either quality,

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.500
or modify packaging,

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.340
modify price and the

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.680
like, or modify the whole

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.840
complex of marketing.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.900
Well, an example is Wimbledon, which

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.120
has been repeatedly mentioned

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:03.280
today, it is just as a commodity

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.580
based on oxygen-milk products,

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.300
with the addition of either

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.040
some vitamins or aloe juice

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:09.800
and the like.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.640
Well, if we look at this product,

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.680
we will see that it is a

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.140
deep meditation of existing

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.420
yogurt or existing

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.220
some kind of cottage and

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.060
the like.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.620
The model of the prism 7900, it

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.300
is a relative, as the company

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.020
itself says, Nokia, a cheaper

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.100
brand, a cheaper brand Nokia 7500.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.780
That is, we see that in this

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.680
case all companies that introduce

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680
modified goods to

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.720
the market use this

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.160
strategy, product development

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.440
strategy.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.780
This is possible if the company

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.940
is already in the market.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.800
The next strategy is a diversification

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.040
strategy.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.440
If you remember, this strategy

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
involves developing new products

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.720
in new markets, and it is often

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.780
associated with expansion into an

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.700
area not directly related

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.120
to the company's activities.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.900
In this case, we will talk about

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.660
the depression strategy

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.860
later, because it will be a separate

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.820
strategy, but I can tell you

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.080
about the Yamaha company.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.600
I have to say that the company "Yamaha"

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.880
associates many people with completely

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.000
different products.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.700
For me, for example, Maha is associated

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.680
with piano because I am from

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.500
a musical family.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.620
For someone, Maha will associate

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.660
with motorcycles, for someone with

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.200
hi-fi systems, for someone

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.600
with guitars and the like.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.980
In other words, the

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.880
company does exist for different

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.880
segments of markets,

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.360
but it exists in different

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.380
markets.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.340
And, of course, what connects a pianist with

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.500
a motorcyclist?

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.900
Certainly not much.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.280
Of course, one can say that people

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.660
who are committed to this brand will

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.440
buy both a piano and a mach and

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.380
a motorcycle.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.580
But it's not the fact that I'm a

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.340
motorcyclist and I'm going to buy a piano.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.780
In other words, there is a

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.500
diversification of goods.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.540
Or, in other words, care in other areas.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.460
If a company decides to

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.120
reduce production and

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.740
market presence, companies

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.680
can use reduction

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.300
strategies.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.200
They can also be formed in matrix

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.240
expressions.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.020
And we can say that these

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.600
cutting strategies are a

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.720
mirror of the strategy of

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.840
intense growth.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.020
The downward strategy matrix.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.580
As you can see, we also have products,

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.300
product parameter, market parameter,

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.940
existing markets and outgoing

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.260
markets, existing products

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.500
and outgoing products removed

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.780
from production.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.300
Milligrams, and the markets available,

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.560
already know you the harvest strategy.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.960
Abandoned markets and existing

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.880
products, that is, those

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.260
products that are demanded from

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.200
a particular market, are

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.180
a strategy to reduce market presence.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.340
Those products that are removed from

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.880
production in existing markets - the

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.980
company can carry out a strategy

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.440
to reduce the product inum cluster.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.180
And last, when the company leaves

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.780
the market and shuts down its activities,

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.340
it is a business shrinkage

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.520
strategy.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.100
We will now look at these strategies

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.140
in more detail.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.780
The harvest strategy is often

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.940
used when switching to a new model,

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.760
relative to the replaced model.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.520
For example, Aquasystem MT, which

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.920
is the official representative

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.880
of MET's technology hall

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.380
and produces a filter-

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.040
barrier to clean the viper,

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.940
uses this strategy when

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.000
replacing one filter,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.440
an outdated model, with a

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.680
new model.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.540
I have to say that I have faced

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.420
this personal life, so to say.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.780
I had this system and a filter

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.420
barrier, and an outdated model.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.800
When I came to the store and wanted

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.240
to buy this model, I was told that

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.340
it was no longer being released,

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:15.660
and I had to buy In this case, most

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.940
companies use this strategy

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.360
when the company not only

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.520
wants to pull this modification

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.640
from the market, but

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.920
also to launch something

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.360
in return.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.860
The second strategy is to

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.380
reduce market presence.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.200
The title speaks for itself.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.760
This strategy is applied when the

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.420
company does not change the

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.620
investment of existing products,

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.600
just leaves the markets.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.300
Why this happens?

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.060
The company can leave the markets for

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:50.740
many reasons.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.320
First, it is some interstate

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.480
decisions, changes in legislation,

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.300
just does not withstand competition

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.200
and curtails its

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.680
activities in this

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.940
market.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.400
Or macro-environment changes,

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.060
some political, economic shifts

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.660
are taking place.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.200
There can be many reasons.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.060
This does not mean that the company is

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.220
just shutting down its activities,

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.960
it is just leaving the market.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.020
Well, an example can be the

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.440
brewing company Molson Coos, which

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.760
entered the Russian market and

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.040
built a factory in Kaliningrad.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400
But unfortunately, she had

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.340
to shrink, reduce her presence

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.400
in Russia and leave because

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.520
she worked with PIT, but there

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.040
was a change of owner, there

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.020
was Heineken, which bought

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.080
the company, and Molson

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.240
Coors realized that

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240
it would be more profitable

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.520
to reduce its presence

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.940
in Russia.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.060
In fact, it has left the Russian

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:00.860
market.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.820
The next strategy

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.960
is to reduce the product list.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.180
It is used by companies when companies

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.700
remain on traditional markets, but

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.940
they reduce the nomenclature,

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:12.980
that is, they reduce

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:18.140
the quantity of goods they supply.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.700
This is often due to the fact that

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.960
the observer has a low

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.160
competitiveness of the product, or

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.260
it happens that the company understands

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.560
that it must transfer

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.900
resources to another developing

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.140
strategic business.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.780
If you remember, we talked about this,

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.920
analyzing the Boston Consulting matrix,

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.900
one way or another the company is

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.000
simply cutting down the product list.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.420
Well, an example is the Moskawi Milk

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.680
Factory in Moscow, if you remember,

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.880
earlier the Moskawi Factory, which

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.020
produces very good dairy products,

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.280
was represented by a number

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.240
of goods.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.940
It was milk, and rye, and cottage,

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.880
and many other products.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.420
Now we can only see milk.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.820
Unfortunately, we should note

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.940
the low competitiveness

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.300
of this company.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.560
Despite the fact that the

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.580
products are really very good

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.200
quality, it still continues

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.240
to bottle milk, pour it

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.040
into bottles, into a glass

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.840
container, which is no longer

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.380
a modern approach.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.720
And at the price of this milk, it is

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.240
also quite expensive and the

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.440
storage time due to the naturality

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.400
of production is quite low.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.240
Unfortunately, it can be noted that

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.560
the company did not withstand

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.100
the competition in the Moscow market

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.300
and overturned its presence in

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.600
this market.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.360
I have to say that the strategy

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.100
of reducing the prejudices on miculators

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.760
is characteristic of a market

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.560
that is quite competitive.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.760
We can see a lot of Russian products

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.000
Smells of the C kasih and Russian

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
companies that were forced

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.880
to follow this strategy.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.680
Because they were local companies

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.100
that would climb into the

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.900
market.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.900
They could not withstand competition.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.360
Many local companies that brought

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.920
their products to Moscow did not

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.240
withstand the competition - were

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.720
forced to cut the produced Kunure

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.040
macl.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.600
They are currently present in one

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.700
or two positions on the Moscow market.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.520
The next strategy is a strategy

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.000
of curtailing the business,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.480
it is to stop the supply to some

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.100
market of all products and organizations

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.280
or just stop the

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.500
operation.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.400
Why this happens?

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.240
Because the company either sells

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.500
its place to another organization,

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:53.760
or it simply overturns its own

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.360
or it is some changes in the macro

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.340
environment, again the

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.340
political environment, the economic

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.420
environment, changes in other environments,

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.300
it is some changes in some legislation

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.000
or just companies do

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.540
not withstand competition.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.460
Well, the example is the Swedish company

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.560
"Skansk", a fairly well-known company,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.060
it plans to shut down its activities

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.060
in Russia, the cause was management

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.440
errors, that is, it is internal

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.280
errors of the company, and as

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.020
a result of this the company

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.440
suffered large losses and was

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.900
forced to shut down its activities,

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.940
that is, it leaves the Russian

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.420
market.

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.100
So, we have looked at two matrix,

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.760
the growth matrix and the downward

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.360
strategy matrix.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.300
I would like to return to

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.920
the diversification strategy.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.380
If you remember, in the Ansov matrix the

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.380
last square is occupied by the

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.300
strategy of diversification, in other

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.100
words, it is the production of new

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.120
goods, the entry into a new market

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.300
with new goods.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.980
But the strategy of diversification,

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.220
if you remember, is aimed at the fact

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.720
that companies go into completely different

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.660
areas not related to the existing

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.740
business, and we can distinguish

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:19.500
two types of acquisitions

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.960
in general - divergence and

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.340
convergence acquisitions.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.720
We will talk about them.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.800
Divergent acquisitions or

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.660
net diversification, as Lamben

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.880
says, are aimed at entering

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.460
a new area of market activity

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.660
for the enterprise that

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.600
is not related to its

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.700
actual activity.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.980
But the goal is usually, of

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.680
course, to expand the portfolio,

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:44.400
to join some new completely

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.900
strategic, or simply

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.420
to update it.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.960
Well, the goal is to expand the presence in

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.060
the market or markets and, of course,

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.640
to expand the impact.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.460
Well, we must say that there

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.900
are not so many examples of

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.360
net diversification, because not

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.900
all companies decide on net diversification,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
because it is really

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.900
a large risk.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:09.640
The company needs to have

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.240
a very large potential to

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.660
decide on net diversification.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.440
Even Yamaha is not engaged

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.940
in pure diversification, because

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.420
it still works in the same

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.120
area.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.120
If we talk about guitars and

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.140
piano, they are musical instruments.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.040
If we talk about motorcycles,

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.420
they are still

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.720
consumer goods.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.480
But here is an example of pure diversification

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.220
– the industrial Sergey Pugachev

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.700
acquired the French chain of elite

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:41.420
stores, restaurants Head Yard.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.760
But, nevertheless, Pogachev

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.800
is already the owner of OPC, which

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.580
is one of the leading companies

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.420
in the field of investment management.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.180
That is, we see that there has

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:55.660
been a pure digitization here, and

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.320
Mr. Pogachev decided to simply

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.360
acquire a completely different

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.000
direction in order to probably

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.280
strengthen his presence in other

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.960
markets.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.580
But again, I want to repeat

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.960
that it must be a very large

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.560
company with a very large

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.220
financial investment potential

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.980
in order to decide

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.920
on net diversification.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.280
But in addition to net diversification,

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.220
apart from divergence acquisitions,

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.840
there is another type of

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.720
acquisition or convergence acquisition.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.780
In other words, concentric diversification.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.440
The Company goes beyond

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.220
the production chain

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.520
within which it has operated

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.300
and seeks new activities

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.400
that, nevertheless, complement

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.240
an existing technological

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.320
process or commercial

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.620
process.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.900
In this case, the company pursues

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.860
the effect of synergy.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.680
In other words, combining

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.620
some processes and obtaining an

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.460
enhanced process.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.440
Well, synergistic effect – An example

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.340
of synergistic effect is an orchestra,

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.120
when the instruments sound separately,

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.220
they sound separately, when

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.260
they sound in an orchestra, we

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.440
hear a completely different

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.540
powerful sound.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.400
For example, we must say that very much,

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.560
speaking of concentric differentiation,

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.280
we see many examples, especially

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.440
after the reconstruction

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.440
period, when Russian enterprises

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.720
are forced to survive somehow,

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.520
to set up the production of some

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.860
goods or some products that

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.180
were not directly related to

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.240
the release of its traditional

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.080
products.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.500
But it was somehow connected

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.540
to the production chain.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.440
Well, for example, the Kirov factory

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.620
in St. Petersburg, a famous factory

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.440
that produced tractors.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.560
Kirovets, he in the 90s set up the

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.780
production of urban buses.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.740
Many city buses are now produced

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.740
at this plant.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:01.980
As you can see, of course, the

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:07.140
tractor and the bus are not related

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.900
mechanisms, but, nevertheless, it

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.120
went beyond the production chain,

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.460
but it still started to produce

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.220
products that are somehow

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.520
still related to the main

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.500
type of its activity.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.620
As we have said, one of the opportunities

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.020
of the enterprise is precisely

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.600
diversification, but

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.740
there are two other types.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.700
One of them is integrated

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.780
development.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.100
In other words, joining a company,

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.920
enterprises in order to simplify

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.280
their position in the market.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.660
Integration makes sense when an

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.660
enterprise intends to increase its

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.660
profitability and control various

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.100
strategic business units

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.460
or links in the product production

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.960
and sales chain.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.500


01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.520
Integration also exists

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.140
in various forms.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.540
First of all, it is integration

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.680
forward, integration backwards,

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.840
and vertical integration, and

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.440
horizontal integration.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.200
We will now look at these types and by type

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.080
of integration.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.540
Vertical integration backwards.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.560
What is vertical?

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.440
Vertical integration means that

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.440
a company joins itself, that is,

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.560
it is buying a business that

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.900
is either linked to a general

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.400
chain, but it is either linked

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.680
at a previous stage or

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.220
at a subsequent stage.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.180
So, if we talk about vertical

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.900
integration backwards, this company

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.280
takes over the management

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.460
of the enterprise of the

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.060
previous stage of the

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.400
production chain to ensure

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.840
the guaranteed quality

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.860
and quantity of products delivered.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.940
Vertical back integration

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.520
can be described by another

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.700
marketing process, namely

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.200
by building vertical

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.580
marketing systems

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.900
or distribution channels,

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.400
where a company integrates

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.040
with other companies

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.580
to carry out marketing

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:16.860
activities, from

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.380
production to product

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.160
distribution.

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:23.940
In this case, if we are talking about

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:27.420
vertical integration back, then

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.860
the company buys some companies

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.880
that are suppliers

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.100
to the company.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.200
For what?

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.300
To control the entire

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.220
process, to protect the

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.440
market from competitors.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.260
A good example here will be the

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.500
Zoo Baltimore Holding.

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.180
As you know, the company Baltimore

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:59.460
produces food products.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.880
These are ketchups, these are sauces,

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.900
this is mayonnaise, these are processed

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.080
canned fruits and vegetables.

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.440
What did the company do?

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.300
It has not only bought the fields

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.380
on which these tomatoes grow, that

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.240
is, it already owns farms, but also

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.620
bought the companies that were

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.960
engaged in the production

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.720
of the tar.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:26.140
The company also bought

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.960
transport companies that are

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.680
engaged in the transportation

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.960
of this agricultural products

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.720
to factories that process

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.580
this product.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:41.900
In other words, the company has done

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:45.220
the integration procedure back,

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.440
and now we see that the whole process,

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.180
the technological process, is

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.960
built into one chain and is

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.360
under the control of the Baltimore

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.320
Holding Hall, that is, the

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.960
company organized Holding.

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.220
Vertical integration forward is

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.400
actually integration with the enterprises

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400
of the subsequent stage of production

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.420
in order to also guarantee

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.980
product sales and

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.900
better distribution.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.660
We can say that there are many

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.040
examples of integration in general.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.680
For example, it is Rosneft, which

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:22.420
not only mines oil, processes

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.960
oil, stores oil, but also

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.280
has its columns in various

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.520
countries.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440
This is also companies that

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.480
are engaged in the processing

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.740
and production of fuel, it is Lukoel,

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.820
for example, Lukoel, as Rosneft

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:42.540
has a very large network of business

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.200
locks not only in Russia, but also

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.500
in Europe, Lithuania, Hungary,

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.260
Poland and even the United

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.040
States.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.100
In other words, by joining,

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:57.520
integrating into its system these

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.000
companies that are engaged

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.080
in the delivery of fuel consumers,

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.600
the company controls and best

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.780
brings products to consumers.

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.320
I have already said that

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.100
building a vertical marketing

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.820
system is the same process,

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.980
but from a different perspective.

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.920


01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.580
Therefore, it must be said

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.560
that the construction of

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.880
franchise companies, which

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880
are vertical marketing systems,

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.360
is integration forward.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.380
The company "Evroshe" is known to everyone,

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.560
especially ladies.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.220
A company that researches,

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.940
produces products, perfume products,

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:37.500
it also brings it to consumers

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.940
through its points.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.840
In other words, it opens stores

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.240
in all countries, it is

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.680
a franchise company, and under

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.840
the auspices of “Evroshe”,

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.400
they sell products of “Evroshe”.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:55.380
I have to say that companies often

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:57.600
combine two integration processes

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.440
– forward and back.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.700
And many companies, especially

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.160
companies that are engaged

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.760
in oil refining, they integrate

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.140
both forward and backwards

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.480
at the same time.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.100
And now we have considered with you

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.420
the vertical integration forward and back.

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.080
Let us go to horizontal integration.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.660
This is another type of integration.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.660
Horizon integration and strategy

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.640
have a completely different perspective.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.280
What is the goal?

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.120
This will strengthen the company's position

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.120
by acquiring and controlling

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.320
other companies competing companies

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.160
to increase market share, to

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.360
increase, to ensure leadership,

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.920
well, and, of course, to

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.260
make more profits.

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:41.040
Well, to implement horizontal integration,

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.040
the company sets the task of

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.820
neutralizing existing competitors.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.220
We see many examples of companies

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:53.940
merging, and sometimes this

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.460
merger happens on a mutual arrangement,

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.480
like Pricewaterhouse, CoopersLibrant,

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.180
two large companies merged,

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.220
it's also a horizontal

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.640
integration.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.140
Well, or here is an example, very

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.240
classic, is the merger of two

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.620
automotive giants Daimler-

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.240
Benz and Chrysler.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.860
Many examples can be given.

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:21.060
I can give you an example because of,

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.380
for example, two companies in Lithuania,

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.360
two supermarket chains, Maxim and Sauliutya.

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.700
Sauliutya was smaller to the network,

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.680
it was absorbed by the company

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.920
Maxim, and now in Lithuania

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.220
there is one network, this is

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.820
Maxim, which is represented by

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.500
various types of stores.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.200
But, nevertheless, the

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.580
company has absorbed another

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.060
company, a smaller competitor,

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.800
to expand its presence.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.960
Of course it is integration.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.720
There are many such examples,

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.700
and, in fact, if we look at

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:59.640
what percentage of types of integration,

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.700
horizontal integration will

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.020
probably take more than 50

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.340
or 60 percent, because it is the

01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:07.820
logically determined business

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.840
process, it is the absorption

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.420
of a weaker competitor

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:13.060
to simplify their positions

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:15.700
and to take a larger

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.620
market share.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.160
All of these strategies are outputted

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.820
into, can be represented in the

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.080
outer acquisition matrix.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.520
So we see two different processes here

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.380
– diversification and integration.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.640
We see new areas and old areas.

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.660
So we see two processes in diversification

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.460
– the implicit acquisitions

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.100
and the convergent acquisitions,

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.360
which we just talked about,

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.080
and we see integrations.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.500
There are two types of integration: vertical

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.040
integration and horizontal integration.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.520
Well, what the matrix of external acquisitions

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.160
gives us, it gives us a simple matrix

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.020
approach and visibility.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.180
And we see so say how companies

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.800
can expand their presence

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.780
in the market.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.140
Well, again, I want to repeat that there

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.900
is, you remember, a third way of expanding

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.120
growth, namely expanding at

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.640
the expense of internal reserves.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.020
But in this case it does not fall

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.980
into the matrix because it is

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:14.160
such a rather minor type of

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.060
expansion of growth, because the

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.520
main blow falls on either

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.800
diversification activity

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.620
or on integration activity.

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.520
Dear listeners, colleagues, in addition

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.740
to the Jacques-Jean Lambert strategy

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:30.420
analyzed above, following Michael

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:33.040
Porter highlights three basic

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.160
strategies.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.940
Domination or leadership in cost,

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.580
differentiation and concentration.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.360
That is, we will consider these three

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.520
main strategies as part of competitive

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.760
strategies.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.580
Leadership strategy

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:47.540
by cost savings.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.960
Well, of course, because of the name,

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.700
it is clear what is the purpose of this strategy.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.180
At the center of this strategy

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.280
is low compared to competitors.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:04.800
The company has a careful

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.120
control of constant expenses.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.780
These are investment costs,

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.600
production costs, design

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.320
development, new product

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.980
development, packaging

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.520
development, reduced

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.040
care advertising costs

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.440
and the like.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.580
I have to say that this strategy

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.920
is used by many companies, but the

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.520
most bright representative of

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.900
this strategy is the company Ikea.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:35.460
If we look at the philosophy of

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.660
this company, it is based on the

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:38.800
strategy of leadership by

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.760
saving on costs.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.260
In fact, the philosophy of this company

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:46.260
is based on the fact that the person,

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:51.160
the buyer comes in the model, goes

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.680
to the warehouse and collects the furniture

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.560
for himself, brings it home

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.900
and collects it himself.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.320
In other words, the company reduces

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.940
prices by saving on costs.

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.020
In this case, it

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.560
manifests its competitive

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.420
advantage as a cost savings.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.640
But, of course, it must be

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.740
said that many companies that

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.620
are not as big as Ikea, also

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:25.280
act and follow can not go into

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.380
the market with very high-quality

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.100
goods, or they are small

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.300
companies that can not compete

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.680
with larger companies, and

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.800
they thus win by reducing

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.860
costs and thus lowering

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.820
the price.

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.660
In the case of a narrow range of market

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.120
activity and therefore competitive

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.380
struggle, we can see a modification

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.280
of this strategy.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.000
It is a strategy of focusing on costs.

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:51.380
In short, the company is

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:54.860
simply focused on costs, and thus

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.720
produces products of not very

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.460
high quality.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.520
I have to say that the strategy

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.640
of focusing on costs is Chinese

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.680
companies that produce

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.620
such consumer products.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.780
Unfortunately, this is the

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.220
same strategy, or fortunately,

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.700
the strategy of differentiation

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.800
is another strategy, The second strategy

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.500
is one of the fundamental marketing

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:25.880
strategies and the essence of this

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.480
strategy is that the product is

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.060
given distinctive properties

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.240
or characteristics that are

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.080
important to the consumer.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.140
That is, the consumer through differentiation,

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.960
through some distinctive properties

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.180
and qualities of the goods, it

01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.880
can be the price, it can be

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.120
the quality, it can be the packaging,

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.320
it can be the distribution,

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.460
it can be the whole complex,

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.460
it differentiates the goods

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.940
from the other.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.540
Well, and thus the company is trying

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.180
to create, of course,

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.720
monopolistic competition, because

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:55.740
of its distinctive characteristics,

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.980
but it is not all companies

01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.960
succeed.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.640
It must be said that the differentiation

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.060
of goods is now a universal,

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:08.080
actually, strategy.

01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.360
There is no company that

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.540
does not use this strategy.

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.160
But Kotler said differentiation

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.500
is easy to, but very

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.620
difficult to maintain.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.020
In other words, you can

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.140
really come up with some move

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.720
and really make your product

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.100
or service differentiated

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.200
from your competitors.

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:34.600
But if this distinctive property

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.500
is very successful, then, of course,

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.580
competitors will not take advantage of it.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.640
Differentiation is difficult to maintain.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.520
That is, in other words,

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.660
differentiation is directly related

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.520
to a competitive advantage,

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.680
as you understand.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.700
But I can give you many examples.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.680
For example, if we take

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.780
mobile phones.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.740
As you can remember, the first

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.140
company to launch mobile

01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.900
phones was Motorola.

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:06.080
It followed this strategy of differentiation.

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.120
It has differentiated itself by

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.820
producing an entirely new product,

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:12.720
but as you can see, there are now

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.100
a huge number of phones, and if

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.280
we don't look at the logo that is

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.680
drawn on the phone, sometimes we

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.600
may not even understand what brand

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.540
is in front of us, because the

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:28.080
design is similar, and some

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.360
similar features, and the like.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.840
Well, of course, if we take,

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.620
for example, the company Nokia,

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:38.100
it has a certain specific

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.580
menu that distinguishes

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.720
this phone from the competitors.

01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.100
I must say that in the service sector

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.860
this strategy of differentiation

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.000
is very strong and often used, and

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.380
I repeat, it is really difficult

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.720
to hold on to.

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.760
Differentiation, I would like

01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.500
to repeat, can take

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.600
very different forms.

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.180
It is a complex of marketing, it is a price,

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.960
it is a promotion, it is a product, it

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.900
is a distribution, it is also a design,

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.400
it is also a after-sales service, it

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.540
is all technological innovations and

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.420
modifications, it is an appearance

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.780
and the like.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.620
The next thing I wanted to say

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.600
is that differentiation, like cost

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.120
leadership, protects an organization

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.680
from competitive forces.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.840
But differentiation

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.060
helps in relation to

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.820
direct competitors, helps

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.000
companies to get away from

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.340
competitors by growing

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:40.120
their loyal or dedicated

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.740
consumers.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.200
Also, a company that

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.540
differentiates in the market,

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.780
it reduces price sensitivity,

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.060
because according to

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:52.060
research, loyal consumers of

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.020
a brand are less sensitive

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.740
to price.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:59.300
If companies raise prices, loyal

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:00.560
consumers are not inclined to

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.840
move to competitors because they

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.460
are committed to the brand.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.960
And of course, the strategy

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.580
of differentiation, as well

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.900
as cost leadership, protects against

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.020
replacement goods.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.060
But it must be said that the strategy

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.020
of differentiation protects

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.020
against substitutes to a greater

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.960
extent than, of course, the strategy

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.240
of cost leadership.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.440
It must be said that the strategy

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.680
of differentiation requires significant investments.

01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.320
Well, this is understandable,

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.720
because the company must constantly

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.420
modify, improve its product

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.320
and the additional investment

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.440
is always needed.

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.780
And if we remember the first part

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.840
of our lecture, namely portfolio analysis,

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.800
in this case portfolio analysis

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.440
helps us to understand where to

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.940
get these funds from the bottom

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.040
cows, what strategic

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.380
business connections with the bottom

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:46.540
cows and where to transfer

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.580
these funds.

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.680
For a wide range of activities,

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.220
the strategy takes the form

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.880
of a strategy for obtaining

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.100
a differential advantage.

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.200
For a narrow range, this differentiation

01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.660
strategy takes the form of

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.300
a focused differentiation strategy.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.260
In other words, the

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:05.000
company focuses

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.420
only on a certain advantage.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.620
Well, for example, if we take

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:13.620
a cafe that is located higher than

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.400
the institution, then here we see,

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.440
of course, a strategy

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.600
of focused differentiation.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.320
What is focused differentiation?

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.060
It's speed, it's knowledge of

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.520
the students' schedules,

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.520
it's the quality of this food.

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.980
Well, actually, of course, if we

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.060
look wider, we will see that

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.240
very many companies also have

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.520
these differential qualities, but

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.900
it is the knowledge that can

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.740
be the schedule, the

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:50.100
knowledge of the wishes of

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.720
students and faculty, are such

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.680
parameters that can, which

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.060
companies follow, following

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.360
a strategy of focused

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.180
differentiation, and will

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:01.940
get a profit.

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.130
Well, we can consider an example,

01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:08.710
a broader example, of a strategy

01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:09.770
for gaining a differential

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:12.330
advantage on the Samsung example.

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:14.990
Samsung, one of the leading companies

01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:17.530
manufacturing household appliances,

01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:20.210
mobile phones and the like,

01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:21.790
It was founded in 1968, and

01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:28.510
it is, as I say, as I said,

01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:32.370
one of the leading

01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:33.310
companies.

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:35.950
And, of course, it is leading

01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:37.250
a very intense competitive battle

01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:38.990
with its competitors, such as

01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:41.430
Motorola, Nokia and other manufacturers.

01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:42.930
But Motorola and Nokia are

01:35:42.930 --> 01:35:44.970
the main competitors to Samsung.

01:35:47.050 --> 01:35:51.390
It must be said that according to

01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:52.670
Samsung analysts themselves,

01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:54.730
it is interesting that it is the

01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:56.130
distinctive characteristics

01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:57.950
of Samsung cell phones that

01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:00.190
have forced Nokia to improve and

01:36:00.190 --> 01:36:04.130
expand the range of its mobile phones.

01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:06.510
Although for this moment, the Finnish

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:08.410
company Nokia did not make any special

01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:09.810
efforts, it emphasized the

01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:13.070
quality of products and remained a monopoly.

01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:15.670
I have to say that

01:36:15.670 --> 01:36:17.270
this is the strategy of differentiation

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:20.090
of Samsung is that it produces

01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:21.310
a very large range,

01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:22.810
a large range

01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:25.530
of cell phones.

01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:27.130
In other words, we can say that this

01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:27.870
strategic business will

01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:29.150
unite, yes, mobile phones are

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.530
represented by a very large

01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:32.170
number of nomenclatures.

01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:35.170
And Samsung constantly produces

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:39.410
modifications, replacing some

01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:42.390
models with other models.

01:36:43.050 --> 01:36:45.910
Also, being a distinctive or

01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:46.950
differential advantage of Samsung,

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:48.770
is that the company produces

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:50.910
a large range of phones, mobile

01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:52.470
designed for different segments

01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:53.790
that have similar

01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:55.850
characteristics in addition.

01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:56.330


01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:58.150
That is, in other words,

01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:01.010
a person who has a small

01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:03.110
amount of money and needs

01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:04.490
a simple, some reliable

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:07.370
device can buy this phone,

01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:09.190
as well as, in fact, a

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.430
person who has significant

01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:11.410
funds, wants to buy a

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:13.550
very such a rough model.

01:37:13.710 --> 01:37:17.090
But in this case, the design

01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:18.630
of the phones will not differ

01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:21.990
so much, and therefore these

01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:23.290
different segments will

01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:26.410
not feel any violation

01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:27.910
and the like.

01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:29.870
And the catalogue of Samsung

01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:32.090
phones is so wide that

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:33.150
no other manufacturer can

01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:36.190
boast of such a product line.

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.810
We talked about a differentiation strategy.

01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:41.150
We have discussed two sub-parts of

01:37:41.150 --> 01:37:42.110
this strategy.

01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:45.910
This is a strategy for

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:47.230
obtaining differential advantage

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:49.090
and focused differentiation.

01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:51.730
We once looked at examples of focused

01:37:51.730 --> 01:37:53.070
differentiation on the example of

01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:55.810
dining rooms or cafes in higher education

01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:58.010
institutions and strategies

01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.850
for gaining differential

01:37:58.850 --> 01:38:01.730
advantage on the example of Samsung.

01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:05.350
Now let us consider the strategy

01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:07.350
of focused differentiation.

01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:10.830
For example, the network of pharmacies

01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:13.070
of the capital Medical, which operates

01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:14.490
in Moscow quite successfully,

01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:16.170
began to use this strategy among

01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.070
the pharmacies of Moscow, that

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:20.790
is, it focused on a certain market.

01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:24.290
She offered her customers delivery

01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:26.150
of goods to the home, starting from the

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:27.490
amount of 300 rubles.

01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:29.670
And took the leading position

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:32.670
from the 99th year until 2004.

01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:36.450
Why is this number worth?

01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:38.090
The fact is that this is

01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:39.530
the differential advantage I

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:41.390
have mentioned, which is easy,

01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:42.650
sufficient, easy to win,

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:44.190
very difficult to hold.

01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:47.450
And now we see that all major networks

01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:49.550
and not large networks offer this

01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:50.290
service.

01:38:50.290 --> 01:38:52.110
In other words, delivery of medicines

01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:55.630
through Moscow through intermediate

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:57.210
courier service start

01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:57.850
certain amounts.

01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:01.070
In other words, this company

01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:02.190
has already lost

01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:03.230
differential advantages.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:05.110
Yes, of course, those loyal

01:39:05.110 --> 01:39:06.150
customers who use the services

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:09.850
of this capitalist network, pharmacy

01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:11.850
network, of course, know and use

01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:14.870
it, but nevertheless you can

01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:17.350
take advantage of a completely

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:18.650
similar service from

01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:24.270
other pharmacy chains.

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:26.330
Also the delivery of goods.

01:39:27.190 --> 01:39:31.170
If the first on the market came the

01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:33.910
store "Seventh Continent" in pool

01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:36.230
7-7, now this service, delivery

01:39:36.230 --> 01:39:37.590
of goods through courier service

01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:40.130
is carried out by a lot of stores.

01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:43.490
Therefore, again, this strategy

01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:46.690
is very dangerous in terms of

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:48.910
the fact that you need to be on check

01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:51.110
all the time, all the time you need

01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:52.510
to look for new differential

01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:54.570
advantages and all the time

01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:55.810
you need to modify this strategy

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:59.930
in some way to get some profit.

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:01.510
I have to say that all these strategies,

01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:04.230
they found a reflection of the matrix

01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:05.350
of basic strategies of

01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:06.350
declaring advantages.

01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:08.770
We see here four main strategies

01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:09.990
– leadership power of costs,

01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.050
which we have now considered with

01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:13.030
you – obtaining differential

01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:14.510
advantage, focusing on

01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:16.490
costs, and focused

01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:17.970
differentiation.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.380
As part of the strategy of leadership

01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:25.080
by cost savings, which we talked

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.500
about earlier, the strategy will be considered

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.580
as well in the laws or effects of

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.560
experience and scale effects,

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.460
which are also presented

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.920
in the form of a new matrix of the

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.140
Boston Consulting Group.

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.580
I must say that acquiring market

01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.060
power through successful differentiation

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:41.780
of goods is one of the ways

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.040
to a competitive advantage,

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.340
as I mentioned.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.360
The second is dominance

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.380
on costs.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.860
Cost reduction can be achieved

01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.100
in several ways.

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.960
And in the process of the company's activity

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.480
it was noticed that in industries

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:58.180
with a large share of manual labor,

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.940
it is some kind of sewing workshops

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.040
or clock workshops, in other words,

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:08.560
in industries with a large share

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.360
of manual labor, where the added

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.960
value is a significant cost as the

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:17.160
experience of the production of

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.800
goods accumulates, in other words,

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.480
the cost reduction occurs because

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.620
the workers or employees of the company

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.660
improve their work techniques the

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.800
company masters new kinds of production

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.980
processes new machines

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.860
and the like improves the concept

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.020
of goods all this leads

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.040
to a reduction in costs that

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.380
is, we talk about that experience

01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:42.120
that is accumulated by the

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:45.300
employees of the company, leads

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.520
to a reduction in costs.

01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:50.980
And in the late 1960s, the BCG group,

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:53.500
known to you for developing the

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.440
Boston Consulting matrix,

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.780
confirmed the existence

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.700
of the experience effect, applied

01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.200
to a very large group of

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.580
different products.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.280
On this basis, the law of experience was established.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:15.080
Why we talk about cost reduction

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.360
strategies because it is

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.600
directly related to it.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.280
The strategic importance of the

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.220
experience law is due to the fact

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.920
that it allows for predicting the

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.740
evolution of costs, in other words,

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.500
what costs can be achieved not

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.840
only for own goods, but also for competing goods.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.740
In other words, we can understand

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.140
how your competing company

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:38.740
can reduce costs by acquiring

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.860
that experience.

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:43.380
The law of decline states that

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.660
the cost per unit of the product

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.140
when it is added to the

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.860
standard product, measured

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.940
in constant monetary units,

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.660
is reduced by a fixed

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.160
percentage for each

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.300
doubling of the product.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.860
I will comment on this

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.820
statement that, in other words,

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.620
the costs that a company incurs

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.600
per unit of product when obtaining

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.720
added value can be reduced

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.860
and can also be measured

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.820
in constant currencies.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:18.220
In other words, a company that

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.640
will track the application

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.840
of its legal experience can

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.820
track how much its cost in cash falls

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.700
with the improvement of

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:29.980
the legal experience.

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.800
In other words, when the employees

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.000
acquire experience, the costs

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.080
are reduced, and these are expressed

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:43.200
in cash, more so that these

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:45.420
costs are reduced by a

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:46.640
fixed percentage with

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.540
each doubling of the product.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.660
In other words, if a company

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.580
produces more and more products,

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.520
there is a reduction in costs

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.700
by a certain fixed

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.140
percentage.

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.660
The definition of the law of experience requires a number

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:01.520
of clarifications.

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.700
First, the term “experience”

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.320
here acquires a certain

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.240
economic specific meaning.

01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.960
This is the total number of units of

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.820
goods produced.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.760
Not the years in which

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.800
the product was produced.

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:18.380
And second, it should not be confused with the

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:20.160
growth of the release over a certain period

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.280
with the increase of experience.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.400
It grows, experience grows both

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.440
in stagnation and decline in production,

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.640
because experience is acquired

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.820
by building up some production

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:35.420
capacity, and thereby costs

01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.240
are reduced.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.660
The effect of experience concerns

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:41.320
only the costs associated with the acquisition

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.380
of added value.

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.100
I would like to remind you

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:46.400
what added value is.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.540
These are all under the control of the

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.940
company's costs.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.200
For example, it is processing, assembly,

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.120
sales of service products.

01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:57.400
The value added is equal to the

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.060
difference between the selling price

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.280
and the material costs.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.160
And, therefore, the cost of obtaining

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.140
the added is the cost of

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.480
ownership, minus the material costs.

01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:10.420
Therefore, experience itself does not

01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.200
reduce costs, but rather provides

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.640
an opportunity for their reduction.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.940
I must say that the effect of experience

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.680
is very often confused with the effect

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.140
of scale, but these are different effects.

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.180
What is the scale effect?

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.860
The effect of scale on the conditional

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.880
size of the operation, and we remember

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.380
that with each subsequent product

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.520
production costs are reduced, and

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.760
the effect of experience

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.180
is manifested over time.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.480
In other words, when we have a scale effect

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.380
on the face, it is due to the size

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.280
of the operation.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.060
That is, we produce more and more

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.660
products and thus reduce costs,

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.440
and experience is manifested

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:51.640
over time.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.100
In other words, there is a reduction in

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:56.100
costs by accumulating experience, by

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.760
gaining experience with employees

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.680
of the company, by mastering the

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.420
name of some new technologies

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:05.140
and the like.

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.000
Therefore, this temporary component

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.600
is what differentiates these effects.

01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:11.360
And confusion arises because

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.680
as experience accumulates, scale

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.960
can increase, naturally

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.720
because when experience accumulates,

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.820
a person begins to serve,

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.780
say, the client, begins

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.560
to perform some operations

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.560
faster, and, naturally,

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.620
costs also fall because

01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:27.140
the volume of the

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.740
operation increases.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.560
The second difference is that

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.920
the effects of scale

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:35.760
always appear.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.840
In other words, dividing the constant

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.400
cost into a large number of

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.500
units will inevitably lead to a

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.340
reduction in the cost per unit

01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:43.980
of goods.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.360
That is, the more you will

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.520
produce units of goods, the

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.840
more costs will be reduced.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.060
This will result in scale,

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:55.140
scale savings.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.560
Experience does not always show.

01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.720
It only appears with time,

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.200
as I said.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.740
Therefore, the gain on costs as a result

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.120
of experience does not manifest spontaneously.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.120
It is the result of concerted

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.920
efforts to reduce costs.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.440
And so it can be done here that the

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.220
effect of scale can arise

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.340
as a result of the effect of experience.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.960
I have already said this again,

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.380
illustrating by example.

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:22.820
That when an employee is exposed

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:25.580
to the effect of experience, in other

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.580
words, it reduces costs due to the

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.180
fact that employees work more

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:34.320
harmoniously, they gain more experience

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.840
by using a particular technique,

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.160
some approaches in introducing

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.420
business to the like, there

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.480
is a decrease in costs, and there

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.060
is also an increase, acceleration

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.800
of the operation, and thus

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.720
there is the effect of scale.

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.900
Therefore, the scale effect can arise

01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:55.120
as a result of the experience effect.

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.240
For example, the cost of financial

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.500
resources for a firm should

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.860
decrease as it develops and

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.120
others gain access to other

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:07.180
cheaper sources of finance.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.960
The model of the experience curve is presented

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.940
here in a graphical form.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.680
We see a curve that decreases here,

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:18.400
and here two parameters are the cost

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.860
per unit of product, it is y and

01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:24.260
the axis x is the cumulative cumulative

01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.560
volume of the products produced.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.540
The law of experience can be represented

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.840
in mathematical form, it can be represented

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.340
by a given, by a given formula,

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:36.200
sp equal to sb, multiplied by

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.660
qp divided by qb, and in this case

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.680
we see here the constant of the

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.520
elasticity of the individual costs.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.340
Well, this mathematical formula

01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.960
can be presented in a different form.

01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:56.340
We see here such a formula that

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.820
the cost produced is equal to the

01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:01.980
base costs, the predictable

01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.820
total output divided by the

01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:07.020
total output, by the basic

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:07.940
total output.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.780
I must say that are naturally

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.020
resorting to mathematical calculations

01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:18.180
of the experience curve and calculating

01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:22.960
the reduction in costs that

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.300
comes from the law of experience.

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:26.240


01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:28.480
This law, the effect of experience,

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.380
the curve of experience is, there is still a limitation.

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:32.700
What are these limitations?

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.000
The law of experience is

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.120
not universal.

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.460
This does not apply to certain

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:40.480
sectors of the economy.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.960
It is primarily implemented either

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.800
in those sectors where the percentage

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.420
of labour is very high, or where

01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.380
large production gives an economic

01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.520
advantage and where the effect of

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.140
training is significant, that is,

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.160
where the training of personnel

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.280
gives a very large economic

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.440
effect.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.480
You can take companies, for example,

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.960
investment companies or insurance

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.380
companies, where really

01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.100
training of personnel will give

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.020
a great economic effect.

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.320
Here there the effect of experience

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:17.200
will work a lot.

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.800
I must say that where it can be

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.400
any production of producing something,

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.520
but, for example, the effect

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.800
of experience does not work so well

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.980
in educational institutions, because,

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.280
of course, the teacher can

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.900
accumulate, of course, experience,

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:33.900
but every time, offering and

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:37.320
sharing knowledge with different

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:39.200
audiences of different training,

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:43.700
it can lead to a reduction

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.680
of this effect of experience.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.460
Well, the typical situations where this

01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.380
effect is ineffective are such that the

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.560
learning potential is small, or the

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.880
share of the delayed cost is insignificant.

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:57.640
In addition to market share, profitability

01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.340
is also influenced by other factors,

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:02.300
such as legislation, as we have already

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.540
said, a strategy of differentiation

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.700
that is important for buyers.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.860
And in this case, the experience that

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:09.560
is accumulated and which leads to

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.960
reducing costs is not so important.

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.580
Consumers would prefer to buy

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.000
a more expensive model because

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.520
it has a number of competitive

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.660
advantages.

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.900
They buy a cheaper model, despite

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.840
the fact that the cost, suppose,

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.380
has been reduced.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.460
Therefore, it can be concluded that

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:37.220
the law of experience should

01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:41.240
be considered in a special context.

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.700
I repeat again, it is necessary

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.100
to clearly imagine that in this case

01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.440
we are dealing with the accumulation

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.300
of experience as a temporary

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.820
component, and, of course, we

01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:54.940
can only talk about reducing the

01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.100
restraints by receiving added value.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.760
We have examined the law of experience

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:08.880
and its comparison with the effect of scale.

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:11.840
And the next strategy, which is

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.680
one of the basic strategies,

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.500
along with the cost reduction strategy

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.020
of differentiation strategies,

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.740
is the concentration or specialization

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:20.680
strategies.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.600
But this strategy is aimed at

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.540
concentration, the needs of some

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.600
one segment or part of the

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:30.120
segment below or some competitive

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.600
group of buyers.

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.160
The company does not aim

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.300
to cover the entire market.

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:38.280
If we consider previous

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.000
strategies, which, for example,

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.960
a cost-saving strategy, it

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:44.160
was the opposite, it wanted

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:45.720
to cover the entire market

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:48.400
by reducing costs.

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:50.460
In this case, the company does

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.960
not set its goal of reducing

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.800
costs, it puts and covers the

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.080
entire market, it sets its goal

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.680
of concentrating on any one segment,

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.340
or on some part of the segment,

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.800
on a competitive group, but

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:06.040
will supply a product that

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.720
has some certain

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.080
characteristics.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.120
Well, such a strategy can rely

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.480
on the two previous strategies,

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.340
or on each separately, but

01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:20.360
can also be used separately.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.040
A strategy of specialization

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.840
or concentration allows you to

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.560
an absolute high market share

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.240
in a specific target segment.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.380
For example, the Danish firm Buhl

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:34.860
&amp; Kir produces eye pressure

01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.160
measuring devices, very specific

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:38.420
medical equipment, and

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.020
controls 85% of the European

01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.200
market.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.480
Its positions are far more than

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.860
the presence of the main Toshiba

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:49.580
in the same market.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:50.740
Why is?

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.540
It is specialized in the

01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:55.160
production of this device.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.420
While Toshiba specializes

01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.400
in the production of completely

01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.600
different medical

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.460
devices.

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.200
This is the measurement of eye pressure,

01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:05.820
blood pressure and the like.

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.040
Not to mention that it

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.120
produces various goods

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.000
both for consumer and industrial

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.060
purposes.

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.020
We have spoken about the fact that the

01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:20.920
law of experience and

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.120
all of these strategies above can

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.600
be combined into a new BCG matrix,

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:28.880
in other words, the Boston Consulting

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.620
Group matrix.

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.180
The Boston Consulting Group, which developed

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.600
the BCC matrix that we discussed with you

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.960
in the first part of the lecture, has made

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:37.120
a great contribution to the expansion of

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:39.040
the application of the law of experience.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:42.840
In fact, in the 1960s and Consulting

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.980
Group brought this law of experience.

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.320
And in 1981, the Boston Consulting

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.240
Group – a company – transformed

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.520
all these strategies into

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:53.300
a new matrix, which was called

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:55.160
the new BQG matrix.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:57.520
It examines the opportunities for

01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.660
growth of the enterprise based

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:01.220
on strategic decisions

01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.380
applied with two indicators in mind.

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:04.240
What are indicators?

01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.920
The first is the cost or cost of volume

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.840
effect, based on the experience

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.000
effect and suggests that when the

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.860
production volume doubles, the costs

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.820
are reduced by 20 percent.

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:18.980
In fact, it is the consequence of the

01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:21.900
law of experience that when this law

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.420
is applied, the costs will be

01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.340
reduced by half.

01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.960
And also the effects of differentiation

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.720
of goods, which we talked about with you, is

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.900
based on the accounting of the life cycle of goods.

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.420
Thus, in the course of the life

01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:36.280
cycle, every product must undergo

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.660
constant changes and improvements.

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.160
As a result of this research, a

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.400
matrix was obtained.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.160
Each quadrant is met by

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.200
a specific competitive

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.400
strategy or situation that requires

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.900
a specific approach.

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.800
This matrix looks more in detail

01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.660
at the specialization or concentration

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.200
strategies, the differentiation

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.220
strategies we talked about earlier.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.660
Look at this slide and you will

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:09.620
see that everything is analyzed.

01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.420
We see with you two approaches

01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:14.540
to cost and volume effect, experience

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.400
effect and differentiation effect.

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.740
We have two parameters -

01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:19.640
strong and high.

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.200
The effect of differentiation is strong and

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:23.980
high, the effect of cost and volume, that is,

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:24.760
the effect of experience.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:27.260
We see with you four main strategies

01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:28.440
– specialized activities,

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.600
concentrated activities,

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.880
fragmented activities

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.780
and non-perspective activities.

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.760
I must say that we have already said,

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.320
we have analyzed the strategies

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.240
of specialization and concentration,

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.360
so we will not be self-

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.800
conducted to consider these two

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.880
strategies, we will talk about潮 fragmented

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:47.300
activity and unperspective

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.580
activity when the effect is

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.020
sufficiently low and strong effect

01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:53.180
of differentiation low

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:57.000
effect of volume cost volume.

01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.600
But high effect of differentiation

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.140
or unperspective activity when

01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:03.240
there is a weak effect of differentiation

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.760
and a low effect of cost

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.640
of speech and volume

01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:12.300
Fragmented activity can

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:13.960
be used in two cases.

01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:16.200
The first is when the initial

01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.220
level of production, potentially

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.760
promising products, fashionable

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.720
biotechnology, nanotechnology,

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:25.440
superconductivity and the

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.600
like occurs.

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.120
And the second is when the

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.520
work requires development and

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.260
highly differentiated approach

01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:35.840
or individual some consulting

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.560
services, or engineering services,

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:41.360
or it is some very complex insurance

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.420
cases, or it is the development

01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:47.540
of original methods

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:49.440
of some restoration,

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.520
conservation and the like.

01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:54.320
So here we are dealing with

01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:56.680
a certain fragmentation.

01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.420
Of course, the scale effect here

01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:00.340
will be quite high.

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:07.240
And the second case, and

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.440
the second strategy, is hopeless activity.

01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:12.200
That is, in this case, the company

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.860
has very little opportunities

01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:16.420
for differentiation, we will look

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.960
again, we see that there is a

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:21.900
weak differentiation and low cost.

01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:23.500
That is, unperspective

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:27.060
activity, what can the company

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:27.720
do here?

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.160
It can either change its

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.180
nature of activity, in

01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:35.260
other words, it is going to

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.300
go to other areas, or it

01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:40.380
can simply stop its activities.

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:44.520
I must say that the new BQG matrix

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:50.040
is used by companies when it is already

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.040
necessary for companies to

01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:53.480
determine what kind of

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.980
specialization and what kind

01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:57.820
of fragmentation should be applied.

01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.520
Before that, I would like

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.000
to emphasize that you and

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.520
I once again considered strategies

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.880
such as cost-focused

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:08.540
or cost-differential advantage,

01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:10.220
cost-leadership, differential

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.540
advantage, and specialization

01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:13.840
concentration.

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:17.340
In fact, the new BQG matrix simply

01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:19.680
looks at all these strategies

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.380
in some way more in detail and

01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:24.300
naturally still attracts the

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:27.520
law of experience here.
