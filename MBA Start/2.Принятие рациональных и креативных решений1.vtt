00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Now we are going to look at the techniques of taking creative decisions or the techniques of creativity.

00:12.000 --> 00:23.000
In general, for most tasks that managers solve in their everyday life, special creativity is not required.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
Most often they use knowledge, skills, intuition, and with their help ideally achieve the desired result.

00:32.000 --> 00:45.000
However, in times of rapid, rapid changes and very tough competition, managers can rely less and less on standard solutions, which are sometimes also called routine solutions,

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
and often it is necessary to find a new solution in an unusual way.

00:52.000 --> 01:05.000
Creative solutions are called solutions found in an unusual way, but nevertheless, they meet the same requirements as standard solutions.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
But the ability to find such solutions is called creativity.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
And we are going to look at the techniques that help in finding these creative solutions.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
But before we move on to the techniques, let's see what are the main characteristics of a creative idea.

01:29.000 --> 01:40.000
The first requirement or the first characteristic says that this idea should be outside of the usual, thoughtful, so-called paths.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
Moreover, it should not be isolated, it should be connected with routine, usual, traditional thinking.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
And most importantly, it should work, that is, bring a fruitful result.

02:01.000 --> 02:17.000
Unfortunately, it is inevitable that a good creative solution, most often realized in a new product, in a new service, in a new, improved process,

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
very quickly turns into a routine, because a very large number of successors appear.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
An example of this is the appearance of black crackers, three crusts, not so long ago.

02:33.000 --> 02:45.000
The idea is simple, and at the same time it turned out to be so profitable that the market was instantly overflowing with all kinds of crackers,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
black, salty, with garlic, and so on.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
But the very development of this creative idea is a very difficult task.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Of course, some of the managers can visit a brilliant idea and it will come to life.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
But most often, the development of new ideas is done professionally.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
For this purpose, large organizations have a whole staff of specialists,

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
who can be allocated to separate departments, which are called, in different organizations, can be called in different ways,

03:31.000 --> 03:43.000
this is a design office, and, if we speak English, what is called Research and Development, that is, the department of development of a new product.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
And in order to systematize the work on the development of creative new solutions,

03:53.000 --> 04:06.000
today, three methods are used most widely, which are called six thinking hats, proposed by Edward de Bono,

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
three thinking chairs, which were created by Walt Disney, and the method of synecdoche.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
We are now proceeding to their consideration.

04:17.000 --> 04:30.000
Six thinking chairs were proposed by Edward de Bono, and are very closely related to the techniques of imagination.

04:30.000 --> 04:43.000
The method can be used to study the prospects of development of a complex situation or problem, which requires comprehensive consideration.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
This technique helps to think over the problem from different points of view,

04:51.000 --> 05:02.000
since each so-called hat, or rather a person sitting in this hat has his own view of things.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
The view is fixed behind each hat.

05:06.000 --> 05:17.000
Hats can be replaced with some other distinguishing features,

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
these can be on the sleeve, these can be cards, but they must be of the same colors,

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
white, red, black, yellow, green and blue.

05:31.000 --> 05:40.000
But those who have already played this game, have used this method, say that hats are better, there is nothing.

05:40.000 --> 05:56.000
And another undoubted advantage of this technique is that it can be used to make individual decisions.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
In this case, a person will sit in turn in each of these hats,

06:02.000 --> 06:13.000
and you can work in a group, then each of the participants will have at a certain time one or another hat.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
What do hats mean and what are their prescribed points of view?

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
An observer, an expert, usually puts on a white hat.

06:27.000 --> 06:39.000
He must always take a neutral position and focus on the available information and objective facts.

06:39.000 --> 06:52.000
But a red hat is a sensual hat, the emphasis is on emotions, feelings, intuition, judgment, premonition, and so on.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
It presents its views without explanations and evidence.

06:57.000 --> 07:05.000
That is, a person sitting in a red hat can say anything that comes to his mind.

07:06.000 --> 07:23.000
A black hat is intended to be a ruthless judge, dressed in a black mantle, strict, and may even be slightly biased to judge what others say.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The emphasis is on criticism and doubt.

07:29.000 --> 07:43.000
As a rule, a person sitting in a black hat should express, justify his logically negative view of things.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
A person sitting in a yellow hat should express a logically positive, optimistic view of things.

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
It should find advantages, benefits, highlight the good points in the idea that others express.

07:58.000 --> 08:12.000
A green hat should focus on creative thinking, build hypotheses, make assumptions, express hypotheses, generate new ideas.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And finally, a blue hat.

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
In principle, it is also better to sit in a blue hat to an observer, an expert.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
A blue hat is intended to be a cold-blooded and detached position.

08:29.000 --> 08:39.000
This hat, or rather, a person sitting in a blue hat should be able to generalize everything that has been said.

08:39.000 --> 08:49.000
The person's responsibility includes the control of processes, sequence of speeches of other hats, recording of their thoughts.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
He controls the chairman, the organizer.

08:53.000 --> 09:04.000
And, in fact, he is supposed to think about the thoughts that were spoken out loud during the conversation.

09:04.000 --> 09:16.000
And after one round, in principle, all participants in this game should change hats.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
The question arises, in what order can and should hats be changed?

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
In principle, you can work in the order in which we have just listed them.

09:30.000 --> 09:45.000
And you can choose hats randomly, for example, by pulling out a card from a stack of these cards.

09:46.000 --> 10:00.000
But it is very important to decide how the hat change or hat transition will take place before the game starts.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And one more point.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Since we have a black hat, a critic, a judge,

10:07.000 --> 10:18.000
it is quite reasonable to introduce a black hat not too early, so that it, so to speak, does not cut a good idea,

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
does not give the opportunity to doubt those who would like to speak in an extraordinary way.

10:26.000 --> 10:40.000
If, as I have already said, one person can sit in hats and mentally represent himself in different roles,

10:40.000 --> 10:52.000
then in the group each of the participants changes one or another hat as one round goes on.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
The main advantage of this method is that people are more open-minded.

11:02.000 --> 11:16.000
When they put on a hat, they know that they must express a critical point of view, a fantasy point of view, and so on.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
That is, it removes some tension and very often a conflict,

11:23.000 --> 11:32.000
allowing people to express deep personal thoughts, considerations, sometimes just crazy to express ideas, and so on.

11:33.000 --> 11:48.000
And it is more convenient for them to defend these ideas, because they do not defend their ideas, but the ideas that belong to the mental hat.

11:49.000 --> 12:03.000
The mental hats have a very big advantage, and this method can be used quite widely.

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
In the textbook you have written a little more about the sequence, about the procedure of this method.

12:11.000 --> 12:20.000
It is not as simple as it seems, because it is quite difficult to switch to another way of thinking,

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
but nevertheless this method is very, very productive when set correctly.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
The next method is called the three-way mental chair.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
It is somewhat similar to the previous method.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
It was developed by Walt Disney, a very restless person, very creative.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
At first he used this method for himself personally.

12:51.000 --> 13:00.000
And in order to develop something, he initially imagined himself in different roles,

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
while moving to different rooms, then the room shrank to the size of a chair,

13:07.000 --> 13:17.000
and in principle, then, from the attachment to a place, to a chair, Walt Disney switched to thinking,

13:17.000 --> 13:29.000
imagining himself as if sitting on a chair, a dreamer, a realist or a critic.

13:30.000 --> 13:40.000
The strategy of this method is that in your thoughts you need to consistently proceed from different positions,

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
to connect these positions better with certain places in order to consolidate.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
For a beginner to work with this method, it may be useful to use Walt Disney's method.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
For a dreamer to sit on a chair in one setting,

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
to switch to a chair of a realist, to move to another room, to another setting, and so on.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
And with the development of the skill, it will be possible to stay on the same chair,

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
but to imagine yourself in different roles.

14:17.000 --> 14:26.000
In the same way as with hats, it is necessary to note that there are certain recommendations

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
on when and where and who to be.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
So, to finish work on the project, you need to be realistic, if possible.

14:38.000 --> 14:48.000
A dreamer's chair. What should a person who has become a dreamer do?

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
He should invent the most fantastic things, play with various possibilities,

14:55.000 --> 15:04.000
and best of all, with some impossibilities, something out of the realm of what is not real enough today.

15:05.000 --> 15:17.000
He is allowed to turn everything upside down, to say absurd things, and to combine, at first glance, the incompatible.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
In principle, you can do everything, but you don't need to think about your problem seriously.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
You need to play, you need to juggle your thoughts, and so on.

15:32.000 --> 15:44.000
In principle, for a beginner and for working in a group, it is better to write down your ideas and ideas on paper.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
If you work alone, then on paper, and if the methodology works in a group,

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
then, in principle, it is possible to use sound recording techniques.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
A realistic chair.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
In this place, a person should include his common sense,

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
but it is necessary to develop, to understand, maybe to land in something,

16:13.000 --> 16:23.000
the crazy ideas of a dreamer, and thereby try to find new rational solutions.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
You need to move forward very planarly and reasonably.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
To do this, it is desirable to choose a short and purposeful path.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
A person sitting on a realistic chair should be pragmatic.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And finally, a critic's chair.

16:46.000 --> 16:58.000
The duty of a person who has become a critic is to subject all previously expressed ideas of merciless criticism,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
asking himself all kinds of questions.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Is there anything in these ideas at all?

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
Can they be used, taking into account the current day, the level of science and technology development, and so on?

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
Are they worth it? Will the consumer notice them? And so on.

17:25.000 --> 17:37.000
In principle, the methodology of three thinking chairs, as well as the methodology of thinking hats, can work in a group.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
And in both cases, if the work takes place in a group, even if individually,

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
the duration of the game should not exceed two hours.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
The strong and weak sides of these two methods.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
The first strong side is that they allow you to distance yourself from the problem.

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
They cover many points of view, especially if the lesson is held in a group.

18:11.000 --> 18:21.000
And they help to relieve, as I said, tension, especially in thinking hats during group games.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
But these methods also have weak sides of a certain kind of limitation.

18:30.000 --> 18:47.000
First of all, the weak side is that it is quite difficult for a person to leave the traditional, let's say, the patterned, usual way of thinking.

18:48.000 --> 19:01.000
And making a decision without a certain training of using these methods, they can be quite close to the traditional way.

19:02.000 --> 19:16.000
And another relatively weak side, which is quickly overcome, is that at first these methods are perceived as something artificial.

19:18.000 --> 19:30.000
But as people master these methods, their effectiveness is significantly increased.

19:32.000 --> 19:43.000
The next method is called the method of synaptics, or the unification of various objects.

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
Synaptics is a complex method of stimulating creative activity, which uses principles and techniques,

19:52.000 --> 20:07.000
such as the brain storm, which you learned in the previous course on making decisions, and the method of analogy and association.

20:08.000 --> 20:20.000
The method of synaptics was introduced by Gordon in the 1950s to overcome the orthodox way of thinking,

20:21.000 --> 20:31.000
to go beyond the traditional ways and methods of solving problems.

20:31.000 --> 20:51.000
The principle of this method is that the spontaneous activity of the human brain is oriented to the study and solution of a problem in a specially selected group of people by using analogies.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
I would like to emphasize that the group of people in this case is specially selected.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
These are specialists in different areas of activity.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
What is the strategy of this method?

21:07.000 --> 21:15.000
In addition to the fact that the group of specialists of different professions is looking for a solution,

21:16.000 --> 21:32.000
the second specific feature is that the members of the synaptic group do not know the essence of the problem before starting work.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
Only some part of the existing problem can be known to them.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Of course, the head knows everything.

21:43.000 --> 21:58.000
And according to the procedure, the game or meeting of the synaptic group usually begins not with the formulation of the problem as a whole,

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
but with the discussion of its separate aspects, the aspects intended by the head.

22:06.000 --> 22:17.000
That is, we first discuss the elements as a whole, and then make a synthesis and generalization.

22:18.000 --> 22:28.000
According to the procedure, first, the participants present to themselves the discussed problem,

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
and all, including the expert, offer their own options for its definition.

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
The head must record all this and present it for general review.

22:44.000 --> 22:53.000
Thus, each of the participants in the meeting becomes, as it were, the author, the owner of the formulation of the problem,

22:53.000 --> 23:08.000
and he usually has a desire to defend his formulation, promote the solution in his own way, and so on.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
That is, he becomes an interested person.

23:14.000 --> 23:29.000
The next step, if you will, is that it is necessary to clear everything that is proposed from completely obvious solutions.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
After all, we are talking about creating a creative solution.

23:35.000 --> 23:53.000
And then you need to turn the unusual into the usual, that is, to find analogies that will allow to express the given problem in terms that are well understood by all members of the synaptic group.

23:54.000 --> 24:07.000
At the next stage, the main difficulties and problems that prevent the solution of the problem are determined.

24:08.000 --> 24:19.000
And then the chairman, asking the guiding questions, offers to give a solution using one of the types of analogies.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
There are four types of analogies.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Direct, subjective, symbolic and fantastic.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
In the case of direct analogies, relative objects are compared.

24:34.000 --> 24:45.000
They provide a useful result for complex systems provided that the parameters of the desired problem are adequate to the parameters of the analog.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Subjective or personal analogies provide for the mental reincarnation of the participant.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
It is necessary to imagine yourself as an object of analysis.

24:59.000 --> 25:12.000
In your textbook, there is an example that in the confectionery industry a large number of walnuts is required, which is very difficult to clean.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
The core of walnuts is to be cleaned.

25:15.000 --> 25:26.000
In order to get them, someone imagined himself as a walnut and imagined how he would tear this shell.

25:27.000 --> 25:38.000
So the idea appeared to break walnuts with pumped compressed air.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
There are a number of examples.

25:44.000 --> 25:56.000
In the case of symbolic analogies, poetic metaphors and comparisons are used, in which the characteristics of a given object are identified with the characteristics of another.

25:56.000 --> 26:14.000
And finally, the fantastic analogy provides for the mental representation of things as they are not really, but as we would like to see them, taking into account the fantasy.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
For example, we would like the road to exist only where the wheels of cars touch it.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And so on.

26:26.000 --> 26:44.000
In the process of the game, the members of the group, in the process of the synoptic session, the members of the group in a free manner should play each leading question of the chairman.

26:44.000 --> 26:52.000
And catch the moment when a promising idea appears.

26:53.000 --> 27:05.000
Develop this idea wordily until the moment when the members of the synoptic group can build a mechanism or a prototype of the device.

27:06.000 --> 27:19.000
Unlike the methods of thinking hats and chairs, solving problems using the method of synoptics requires much more time.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
It can be even several weeks at a full working day.

27:27.000 --> 27:38.000
At the same time, part of the time is spent on discussion, and the other part is spent on practical work, building prototypes, models, and so on.

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
This is where we finish our discussion on the methods of decision-making.

27:49.000 --> 28:02.000
But if we make a decision soon, it is necessary and appropriate to talk about the mistakes that managers make when making decisions.

28:08.000 --> 28:17.000
What is the role of decision-making?

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
I have said many times that managers must make decisions quickly in the modern world.

28:27.000 --> 28:36.000
And a quick decision brings a risk and the commitment to make big mistakes or frequent mistakes.

28:36.000 --> 28:44.000
Therefore, theoreticians and practitioners in the field of management have made a good generalization,

28:45.000 --> 28:55.000
which allows to present a list of the most typical mistakes that managers face.

28:55.000 --> 29:05.000
Why? To help them to look at possible mistakes before the decision is made,

29:06.000 --> 29:17.000
and to learn to make better and more effective decisions on their or someone else's mistakes.

29:17.000 --> 29:26.000
Moreover, a mistake is a mistake.

29:27.000 --> 29:36.000
One mistake can become a starting point for the next, sometimes even creative decision,

29:36.000 --> 29:53.000
and some mistakes, especially at the strategic level, can irrevocably ruin the business, even a long-standing business on the market.

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
What are the main reasons for making a decision?

30:02.000 --> 30:10.000
Most often, this reason is hidden in the method of their acceptance.

30:11.000 --> 30:26.000
The options of choice, alternatives, accurate information, all advantages and disadvantages, the prediction was inaccurate, and so on, were not clearly defined.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
But there is another reason why a person makes a mistake.

30:33.000 --> 30:42.000
And it is not about the collected information or the wrong approach to the research.

30:43.000 --> 30:55.000
Sometimes the human brain works in such a way that we simply make a wrong choice, even having enough relevant information.

30:56.000 --> 31:05.000
In this course, we will present you with typical mistakes,

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
in the way they are grouped by three specialists in this field.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
These are Matthias Nölke, Paul Natt and John Hammond.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
Matthias Nölke calls the six most common mistakes when making a decision.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
The first is that you postpone the decision.

31:32.000 --> 31:38.000
The second is that you judge everything too hastily, as an antithesis.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
The third is that you rely entirely on your feelings, that is, a completely intuitive decision.

31:46.000 --> 31:54.000
The fourth mistake is very serious and often occurs,

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
that a person making a decision does not separate the main from the secondary,

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
and tries to decide both, and sometimes more often only the secondary.

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
The fifth mistake is that a person spends too much energy on making a decision.

32:17.000 --> 32:32.000
And the sixth is that he tries to decide only the easiest decision, postponing the decision for later.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
If you postpone a decision, think for yourself.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
After all, many of us often postpone a decision.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I will think about it later.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Why is it that a decision is postponed most often?

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
First of all, a person is afraid of the risk of responsibility.

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
If the decision has already been made, then the mistake will have to be answered,

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
better postponed, maybe the matter will be resolved somehow by itself.

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
And another reason is that as soon as you make a decision,

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
all other decisions are already losing their relevance.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And some people want the horizon to be open to them.

33:37.000 --> 33:47.000
And suddenly, in a day or two, we will find evidence that this is not the best alternative, but some other.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
What consequences can postponing a decision have?

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
The fact is that most often in practice it happens in such a way

34:01.000 --> 34:08.000
that the situation does not improve and the matter does not improve by itself,

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
but on the contrary, the conflict in the situation becomes even more complicated,

34:15.000 --> 34:24.000
sharpened, and the time for its decision is already lost and it becomes even harder to make a decision.

34:24.000 --> 34:32.000
Well, in the business world, there is certainly a danger, a probability,

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
that someone will make this decision instead of you and thus leave you behind.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
What does it mean to judge a decision, to make a decision too hastily?

34:49.000 --> 35:01.000
That is, to accept it before all the necessary and sufficient information is collected for making this decision.

35:02.000 --> 35:10.000
When an analysis of your capabilities, resources, and so on, is done,

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
very often, we do not talk in this case about intuitive decision making, purely intuitive,

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
sometimes it is just a desire to be ahead, to take, if you want, a bull by the horns,

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
to take the lead over the situation so as not to be late, as in the previous case.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
Unfortunately, in such cases, decisions are often lacking in foundation,

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
the risk of making a wrong decision increases many times,

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
a decision that will be difficult to explain, analyze, and so on.

35:51.000 --> 36:04.000
And what is not unimportant, such a hasty decision makes the person who made this decision very vulnerable to manipulation.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
He will not be able to prove why he made this decision,

36:09.000 --> 36:19.000
proposed this particular action, and not another, because the strategy was practically not developed.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
If, when making a decision, the manager relies only on his feelings,

36:27.000 --> 36:33.000
then we say that he makes the decision intuitively.

36:34.000 --> 36:42.000
The main drawback of an intuitive decision, we talked about this at the beginning of the course,

36:43.000 --> 36:52.000
is that they cannot be rethought, analyzed, and proved to colleagues why exactly so,

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
and not just the way they are.

36:59.000 --> 37:07.000
A very serious mistake is not being able to separate the main from the secondary.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
Very often it is associated with the inability to structure your thinking,

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
to focus your attention on important points, and to leave insignificant ones aside.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.000
A person tries to solve both of these, and as a result,

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
there is such an expression, in fact, the thought spreads like wildfire,

37:36.000 --> 37:44.000
and in order to focus on the main, he lacks either skill,

37:44.000 --> 37:53.000
or in the future, time to solve the main problem, the main reason, the primary reason.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
The consequences of this are extremely sad.

37:59.000 --> 38:06.000
Most likely, when it becomes clear that there is no longer any time to delay and investigate,

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
the decision will be made randomly,

38:11.000 --> 38:19.000
and at the same time, the risk of making a wrong decision increases many times.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
Since the thinking, the rethinking was not structured,

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
it will be very difficult to make a historical analysis of the decision,

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
to understand what the mistake was, and how to avoid it in the future,

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
if the decision is accidentally correct,

38:44.000 --> 38:54.000
then it will be difficult to repeat it in the future due to the same reasons.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
Another mistake is spending too much energy,

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
which is understood in this case under the expense of energy.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
Partly, it may be due to the indecisiveness of a person,

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
or due to the mistake of postponing the problem,

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
and sometimes it's just a characteristic of a person who is called a perfectionist,

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
they want to work everything out carefully, a huge amount of information is collected,

39:33.000 --> 39:41.000
it is carefully analyzed, a large number of specialists are attracted to critical study of the process,

39:42.000 --> 39:49.000
in order to reduce the risk of mistakes.

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
On the one hand, in general, it looks probably not bad, reasonable,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
but there must be moderation in everything.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Thank you.
