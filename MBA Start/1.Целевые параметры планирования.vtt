00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Hello, my name is Elena Nikolaevna Stanislavchik.

00:03.200 --> 00:12.400
I teach business economics, financial management, investment design at the Academy of Business Administration,

00:12.400 --> 00:19.200
as well as in the system of training of professional accountants, anti-crisis managers, within the framework of the MBA program.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.400
I am actively engaged in consulting as an expert in investment projects.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.200
I work in the project financing department of Intrast Bank.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.400
Today we will discuss the basics of financial planning.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.400
The importance and relevance of this topic today, in the wake of financial scandals, in my opinion, does not raise any doubts.

00:39.400 --> 00:45.400
Do you want to know how the actions of financial managers can lead to zero achievements of a company in production,

00:45.400 --> 00:51.400
in the markets of surplus, in insurance, or vice versa, how to create money from scratch,

00:51.600 --> 00:57.600
skillfully managing the turnover of assets, profitability, optimizing the cost of capital,

00:57.600 --> 01:01.600
using the effects of leverage and other professional secrets.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.600
Your business is short of money, there is profit in the account, and the account is empty.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.600
These problems are intended to be solved by financial planning.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.600
Financial planning is interesting, useful and necessary.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.800
Our video course is intended for managers and managers,

01:18.800 --> 01:21.800
designed to instill the sustainable skills of planning,

01:21.800 --> 01:27.800
including forecasting of the components of the money flows and assessing the expected financial results.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.800
The course is aimed at solving the emerging problems in business.

01:31.800 --> 01:37.800
The training method assumes that the listeners are already familiar with the basic terms of financial management

01:37.800 --> 01:42.800
or can refer to the glossary and the recommended literature.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
During the lecture, I often use the term enterprise,

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
considering it the most general and, thereby, emphasize the entrepreneurial component of any company,

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
company, corporation, organization or financial institution.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Our lecture consists of 10 sections.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
I hope that by formulating the target parameters, strategic and tactical tasks,

02:09.200 --> 02:14.200
we will be able to emphasize and highlight the red thread of planning processes.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.200
During the presentation of theoretical foundations of financial planning,

02:18.200 --> 02:22.200
examples from practice, logical schemes and graphs will be given.

02:22.200 --> 02:29.200
The approximate ratio of theory to practice will be 10.5 minutes, 15 minutes per one section.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.200
For independent work, you can use an e-book,

02:34.200 --> 02:38.200
which contains text and lectures, and a workbook with tasks.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.400
Please complete the tasks after listening to each section of the video course.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.400
Friends, first of all, I would like to introduce your enterprise as an open system

02:47.400 --> 02:52.400
connected with other enterprises in the markets of purchases and sales by the movement of goods,

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
by the goods flows.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.400
The goods flows define the main functions of the enterprise,

02:58.400 --> 03:02.400
providing, manufacturing goods or providing services and sales.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.600
For the movement of goods, the opposite flows of money are necessary,

03:07.600 --> 03:11.600
cash flow, cash flows.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.600
Cash flows also connect enterprises with the state and the capital market.

03:17.600 --> 03:23.600
Thus, enterprises in financial management are a subject of financial relations,

03:23.600 --> 03:28.600
surrounded, immersed in the financial sphere.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.800
Input and output cash flows,

03:32.800 --> 03:38.800
we will call cash inflows or incomes and outflows or payments.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.800
I ask you, looking at this scheme of financial flows,

03:42.800 --> 03:46.800
to try to formulate a financial goal, a financial result,

03:46.800 --> 03:50.800
a financial condition for the prosperity of the company,

03:50.800 --> 03:56.800
a condition for enrichment or a condition for the growth of the value of the business.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
The answer to the income is not quite correct.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Let me explain by example.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Let's say that the revenue of the enterprise for some period was 1000 RUB,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
the current expenses are 800 RUB,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
including the amortization figure of 100 RUB.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Then the balance profit of the enterprise is 200 RUB,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
the tax on the profit at the rate of 24% is 48 RUB,

04:23.200 --> 04:29.200
and the account of the enterprise will have 162 RUB of net profit

04:29.200 --> 04:33.200
and 100 RUB of amortization figures.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.200
These figures appeared in the accounting in one version of the accounting policy.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.200
But if we use another accounting policy

04:41.200 --> 04:44.200
and apply, for example, accelerated amortization,

04:44.200 --> 04:48.200
increasing the amortization figure by 2 times,

04:48.400 --> 04:54.400
then we see that despite the fact that the profit in the accounting is decreasing,

04:54.400 --> 04:58.400
the tax on the profit is decreasing,

04:58.400 --> 05:02.400
therefore, the enterprise's account, as a financial result,

05:02.400 --> 05:05.400
results in a larger amount.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.400
The financial goal of the business and the task of financial planning

05:10.400 --> 05:15.400
is to coordinate the inflows of financial resources and outflows

05:15.600 --> 05:19.600
or to provide liquidity in the broad sense.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
Accordingly, the financial result, net cash flow,

05:25.600 --> 05:31.600
or net cash flow, is a net cash flow.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.600
The difference between these indicators, profit and net cash flow,

05:35.600 --> 05:39.600
is based on the division of the concept of results,

05:39.600 --> 05:44.600
income, and expenses, expenses, and payments.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.800
Income and expenses, inflows and outflows,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.800
are the main objects of financial planning.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.800
Profit and cash flow are different sections of the analysis,

05:55.800 --> 05:58.800
interconnected but not duplicating parameters.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.800
Thus, profit in accounting does not always mean

06:02.800 --> 06:06.800
the presence of money in the account of the entrepreneur.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.800
For example, the Wallmart network,

06:09.800 --> 06:13.800
before its maximum growth in the 70s and 80s,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
had a constant negative free cash flow.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Sam Walton opened a new branch at such a pace

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
that there was not enough current turnover for financing,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
but the profitability of new trading houses was on average 25%,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
which was much higher than the average capital price of the company.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Thus, behind the negative net cash flow,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
success was actually hidden,

06:41.200 --> 06:45.200
and the company's share price was the highest in the world at the time,

06:45.200 --> 06:49.200
and Sam Walton became the richest person in America.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.200
The indicator of the added economic value of the Wallmart network

06:53.200 --> 06:57.200
increased from $30 million in the 80s

06:57.200 --> 07:01.200
to $528 million in the 1990s.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.200
So, we have clarified the goals of the activity

07:05.200 --> 07:09.200
in the light of the concept of cash flows,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
and now we need to know exactly

07:11.400 --> 07:15.400
when and how much money is needed

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
to fulfill the tasks set,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
when and how much will be received.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.600
Financial planning

07:35.600 --> 07:39.600
This is what financial planning is all about.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
Planning is a component of the company's management process.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.600
It is a conscious prediction of actions,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
a comparison of various development options,

07:48.800 --> 07:52.800
a definition of goals, paths and conditions for achieving goals,

07:52.800 --> 07:55.800
modeling the results of the activity,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
the search for favorable opportunities,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
and the creation of conditions for tomorrow.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.800
Strategic planning begins with the question

08:04.800 --> 08:10.800
of what we want to achieve and where we are.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.800
This catalog of requirements gives an answer to the question

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
of what we want to achieve

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
with the key parameters for developing a strategy.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Financial planning can be considered

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
as a process of setting strategic parameters of activity

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
and standards for controlling their implementation.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Today, in the conditions of uncertainty, instability of the situation,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
it is necessary to review the planned tasks,

08:41.200 --> 08:43.200
the set of indicators and standards,

08:43.200 --> 08:45.200
which is the essence of monitoring.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.200
The first place today is given by two blocks of management

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
– planning and monitoring.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
Financial planning is a component

08:53.200 --> 08:57.200
of the general planning process at the enterprise.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.200
Financial planning uses information

08:59.200 --> 09:01.200
from the marketing plan,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.200
production plan,

09:03.200 --> 09:07.200
subordinates of the mission and general strategy.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.200
The main tool of planning is analysis.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
Financial planning uses the results

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
of financial analysis,

09:14.400 --> 09:18.400
the analysis of accounting data.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.400
The scheme of planning of money flows

09:23.400 --> 09:25.400
we have considered in the previous block

09:25.400 --> 09:29.400
allows us to look at the place of the block of finances

09:29.400 --> 09:32.400
in the system of balanced indicators.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
This is not some isolated area.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.400
Finances are invested in all operational processes.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.600
Financial planning connects marketing,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
personnel and production planning

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
in a single link.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
The essence of financial planning

09:48.600 --> 09:50.600
is that we need to calculate

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
all the components of the inflows and outflows

09:52.600 --> 09:54.600
of the financial funds,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.600
assess the cash flow.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.600
Financial planning takes into account

09:58.600 --> 10:00.600
external and internal parameters.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
External parameters include

10:02.600 --> 10:04.600
the amount of money,

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
the amount of money,

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
the volume of demand

10:08.800 --> 10:10.800
and supply of goods,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
the prices for products and resources,

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
the system of calculations

10:14.800 --> 10:16.800
between suppliers and consumers,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.800
the conditions of lending,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
the order of taxation

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
and other factors.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.800
Internal planning parameters,

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
such as the scale of the business,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.800
determine the production capacity

10:28.800 --> 10:30.800
and, accordingly,

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
the number of products

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
that are issued.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The level of technology of the organization

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
of operational processes determines

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
the cost and prices of the products.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
The level of management

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
is expressed

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
in the effectiveness

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
of business activity.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Types of planning

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
can be divided

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
according to various signs

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
of classification

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
into operational, current

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and forecasting.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
According to the time,

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
the planning horizon

11:05.200 --> 11:07.200
is short-term

11:07.200 --> 11:09.200
and short-term.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
Types of planning can be divided

11:11.200 --> 11:13.200
according to various signs

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
of classification

11:15.200 --> 11:17.200
into operational, current

11:17.200 --> 11:19.200
and forecasting.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.200
These types of planning

11:21.200 --> 11:23.200
differ in different degrees of flexibility.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
Operational planning is

11:25.200 --> 11:27.200
the lower management link,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
the current middle management link

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
and strategic planning

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
is the higher management link.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.400
As we have already said,

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
planning is inseparable

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
from controlling.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
Therefore,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
each type of planning

11:43.400 --> 11:45.400
involves setting

11:45.400 --> 11:47.400
certain indicators.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.400
Forecasting sets

11:49.400 --> 11:51.400
general strategic parameters,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.400
such as the market value

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
of the enterprise,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
the structure of capital,

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
the average value of capital,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
the economic added value.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Current planning

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
based on these strategic indicators

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
calculates financial

12:07.600 --> 12:09.600
coefficients

12:09.600 --> 12:11.600
and, finally,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
the maximum detail

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
occurs

12:15.600 --> 12:17.600
in operational planning,

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
when private

12:19.600 --> 12:21.600
individual indicators

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
are set,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
which are understandable

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
at any lower management link.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.800
The content of planning

12:29.800 --> 12:31.800
is different,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
for example,

12:33.800 --> 12:35.800
in the planning of the creation of a new enterprise

12:35.800 --> 12:37.800
or in the planning of the development

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
and expansion of the business

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
of the current enterprise.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.800
In the direction of planning,

12:43.800 --> 12:45.800
in the planning technique,

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
there are forms of planning

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
from top to bottom,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
from bottom to top

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
or counter-planning.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Thus,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Valya and I

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
tried to connect

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
the task of increasing

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
the value of the business

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and such control parameters

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
as the price of capital,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
the target structure of capital

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and the rules of financing.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The essence of financial planning

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
is to calculate

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
all the components of the inflows

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and outflows of financial funds.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
At the same time,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.200
we also need to calculate

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
the external and internal conditions.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.200
The external parameters of planning

13:28.200 --> 13:30.200
include the volume of demand

13:30.200 --> 13:32.200
and supply of goods,

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
the prices for products and services,

13:34.200 --> 13:36.200
the system of calculations between enterprises,

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
the conditions of lending,

13:38.200 --> 13:40.200
the order of taxation.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.200
The internal parameters of planning

13:42.200 --> 13:44.200
are, first of all,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
the scale of the business,

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
determining the production capacity

13:48.200 --> 13:50.200
and the number of products

13:50.400 --> 13:52.400
or services.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
The level of technology

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
and the organization of production processes

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
determine the cost

13:58.400 --> 14:00.400
and prices for goods.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
The level of management

14:02.400 --> 14:04.400
determines the effectiveness

14:04.400 --> 14:06.400
of the indicators of activity.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.400
These external and internal parameters

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
affect the income and expenses

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
of the enterprise

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
on the inflows and outflows of money.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
Planning is based

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
on a certain set

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
of systematic key parameters

14:20.600 --> 14:22.600
of activity

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
and planned indicators.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
In general, we can say

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
that financial planning

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
is a process,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
and a financial plan is a set of documents

14:32.600 --> 14:34.600
based on which planned financial indicators

14:34.600 --> 14:36.600
of activity are calculated.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
The types of financial planning

14:38.600 --> 14:40.600
are divided

14:40.600 --> 14:42.600
according to various features

14:42.600 --> 14:44.600
into the main three groups

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
of forecasting,

14:46.800 --> 14:48.800
current planning

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
and operational planning,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
respectively, which are distinguished

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
by the horizon of planning.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.800
The long-term perspective

14:56.800 --> 14:58.800
is forecasting,

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
the medium-term is current planning

15:00.800 --> 15:02.800
and the operational is limited

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
to the short-term period.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.800
The degree of detail

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
for each type of planning

15:08.800 --> 15:10.800
is its own,

15:10.800 --> 15:12.800
the most enlarged indicators

15:12.800 --> 15:14.800
inherent in the strategic planning

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
are the most detailed indicators

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
of activity,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
the most detailed indicators

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
are those inherent

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
in the operational planning.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
In addition to these features,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
the current,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
operational

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
and long-term planning

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
are distinguished

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
by the volume

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and completeness of information,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
flexibility,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
various levels of management

15:43.200 --> 15:45.200
are engaged in different types of planning.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.200
Operational planning

15:47.200 --> 15:49.200
is the lower management level,

15:49.200 --> 15:51.200
the current planning

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
is the middle management level

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
and the strategic parameters

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
are determined by the higher management.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.200
The indicators that are established

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
during planning

16:03.200 --> 16:05.200
as a result of planning

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
are the following.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.200
Strategic parameters

16:09.200 --> 16:11.200
as a result of forecasting

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
include market value

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
of the enterprise,

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
capital structure,

16:17.400 --> 16:19.400
additional value.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
Current financial planning

16:21.400 --> 16:23.400
leads to a certain set

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
of financial coefficients.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.400
Operational planning

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
clarifies

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
and highlights

16:33.400 --> 16:35.400
private, separate indicators of activity,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
for example, the financial cycle,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
which we will consider

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
in the next sections.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
The content of planning

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
includes planning

16:45.600 --> 16:47.600
of the current enterprise,

16:47.600 --> 16:49.600
planning of its development

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
or we create a new enterprise,

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
develop

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
investment projects.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.600
Planning technique

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
can be from top to bottom,

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
from bottom to top

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
or more often mixed,

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
counter-planning.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.600
How does strategic planning work?

17:17.600 --> 17:19.600
The limitation of the spheres

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
of long-term and short-term planning

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
implies not only

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
different horizons of planning

17:25.600 --> 17:27.600
but also different set of target parameters.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.600
Strategic financial decisions

17:33.600 --> 17:35.600
on investments, financing,

17:35.600 --> 17:37.600
mergers and absorption

17:37.800 --> 17:39.800
of the enterprise,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.800
the economic value,

17:41.800 --> 17:43.800
the target capital structure,

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
the average value of capital.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.800
The strategy is to ensure

17:47.800 --> 17:49.800
financial balance.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.800
Special attention

17:51.800 --> 17:53.800
should be paid

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
to the financial and management

17:55.800 --> 17:57.800
parameters of the enterprise,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.800
since the financial sphere

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
is inseparably connected

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
with the production sphere,

18:03.800 --> 18:05.800
with the operational processes,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and the management decisions

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
in the field of purchases,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
production and sales.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Let's look at the strategic parameters

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
of financial planning.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
We are talking about the long-term

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
financial plan, which implements

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
the decisions of managers

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
on the investments needed

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
to implement the accepted strategy

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
of increasing the value of the business

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and on the financing methods.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
In these decisions

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
on investments and financing,

18:34.200 --> 18:36.200
the target capital structure

18:36.200 --> 18:38.200
is used as a reference

18:38.200 --> 18:40.200
for the comparison of alternatives.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.200
The target capital structure

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
is the parameter.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
In these decisions

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
the target capital structure

18:48.200 --> 18:50.200
is used as a reference

18:50.200 --> 18:52.200
for the comparison of alternatives.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200
Since the price of capital

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
increases with the increase

18:56.200 --> 18:58.200
of the share of borrowed funds,

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
the management task is to choose

19:00.200 --> 19:02.200
the target capital structure.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
For example, the asset structure

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
is more intensively used

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
by those enterprises

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
that have property suitable

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
for the deposit.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
The growth rate of fast-growing enterprises

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
is more intensively used

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
by external financing,

19:18.400 --> 19:20.400
while the costs of placing shares

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
are usually higher than the costs of loans.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
Profitability.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
The next factor.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
Enterprises with high returns

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
on invested capital prefer

19:30.600 --> 19:32.600
to invest their own funds.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.600
They have enough accumulated profits.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
The planning of the capital structure

19:36.600 --> 19:38.600
refers to the area of financial leverage,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
which is used in decisions

19:40.600 --> 19:42.600
about whether to take or not to take loans,

19:42.600 --> 19:44.600
that is,

19:44.600 --> 19:46.600
about the structure of financing sources.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
Leverage refers

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
to the highest skill

19:50.600 --> 19:52.600
of financial management.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
It is with the help of the leverage

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
that financial managers

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
decide

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
the fate of the company,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
how it will develop

20:02.800 --> 20:04.800
in terms of profitability

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
and risk.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
Profitability and risk

20:08.800 --> 20:10.800
are the polar motives

20:10.800 --> 20:12.800
for making decisions.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
High profitability

20:14.800 --> 20:16.800
is usually achieved

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
by the price of risky actions.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.800
Therefore,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.800
in order to minimize the risk,

20:22.800 --> 20:24.800
as usually managers tend to risk,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.800
shareholders require

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
a certain return on their invested capital.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Therefore,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
certain rules of financing

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
have been developed.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
These rules can be easily controlled

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
by the balance of any enterprise

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
by comparing

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
the positions of assets

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
and passives of the enterprise.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Here you can see

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the main components

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
that we need now,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
what to pay attention to

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
in assets and passives of the enterprise.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
The so-called

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
golden rule of financing

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
describes the requirements

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
of the horizontal structure of the balance.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
That is,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
the positions of assets

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
and passives are compared.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
According to this rule,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
it is necessary

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
that the long-term positions

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
of assets,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
which the enterprise will use

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
over long periods,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
be covered by the long-term

21:25.200 --> 21:27.200
rules of financing.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.200
In short,

21:29.200 --> 21:31.200
the capital itself should be covered

21:31.200 --> 21:33.200
by non-returnable assets.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.200
This is a narrow and strict rule of financing.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
The extended rule of financing

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
allows you to compare

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
all long-term sources of financing,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
that is, your own capital

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
and borrowed capital

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
with non-returnable assets.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
The golden rule of financing

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
is called

21:51.200 --> 21:53.200
the golden rule

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
of capital management in Germany.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
The requirement of the vertical structure

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
of capital is

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
that your own capital

22:01.400 --> 22:03.400
and your own sources of financing

22:03.400 --> 22:05.400
should exceed the borrowed capital.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
This is the so-called

22:07.400 --> 22:09.400
50-50 rule,

22:09.400 --> 22:11.400
the favorite American

22:11.400 --> 22:13.400
rule of financing.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
As the Americans say,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.400
the essence of this rule

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
is to limit the size of your business

22:19.400 --> 22:21.400
and the size of your wallet.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.600
The rule of financing is aimed at

22:23.600 --> 22:25.600
dividing the risk between the investor

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
and the creditor.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.600
The owner

22:29.600 --> 22:31.600
has no right to count on

22:31.600 --> 22:33.600
the fact that

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
by taking some insignificant

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
capital,

22:37.600 --> 22:39.600
he can get a significant loan.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
The rule says

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
that

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
the condition of 50-50 is necessary.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.600
This is in theory.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
In fact,

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
the deviation of the share

22:51.800 --> 22:53.800
of your own capital

22:53.800 --> 22:55.800
in the balance

22:55.800 --> 22:57.800
from the critical level

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800
of your own capital

22:59.800 --> 23:01.800
may be less than 50%

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
due to the mismatch

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
of the market and balance value of the business.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.800
In addition,

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
a low share of your own capital

23:09.800 --> 23:11.800
can be afforded by companies

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
that have a stable and predictable

23:13.800 --> 23:15.800
income of money,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.800
for example, retail trading,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
and other business activities.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
If we take the statistics of the companies,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
we will see

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
what is going on,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
how the companies have solved

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
their problems of investment and financing.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We will see that

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
in the vast majority of companies,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
for example,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
the accounting in Germany

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
does not exceed 25%.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
We see

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
that the share of your own capital

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
also depends on the scale of the business.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.200
The higher the turnover,

23:48.200 --> 23:50.200
the greater the share

23:50.200 --> 23:52.200
of your own capital.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.200
These rules

23:54.200 --> 23:56.200
can be controlled

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
in addition to the balance

23:58.200 --> 24:00.200
positions,

24:00.200 --> 24:02.200
by calculating

24:02.200 --> 24:04.200
special analytical coefficients.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
Please see

24:06.200 --> 24:08.200
the main coefficients

24:08.200 --> 24:10.200
corresponding to the rules of financing.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.200
The golden rule of financing

24:12.200 --> 24:14.200
is the coefficient of the coverage

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
of your own capital,

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
the coefficient of the coverage

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
of your own capital,

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
the coefficient of the maneuverability

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
of your own capital,

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
and the coefficient of financial stability.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
These coefficients

24:28.400 --> 24:30.400
are calculated

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
according to the reporting data

24:32.400 --> 24:34.400
and are the main conditions

24:34.400 --> 24:36.400
for obtaining

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
new loans.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
Their normative value

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
is usually recalibrated.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
The company chooses

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
its favorite coefficient

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
and focuses on this one.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
We see that these coefficients

24:50.600 --> 24:52.600
are duplicating each other,

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
they are interconnected.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.600
It is enough to choose

24:56.600 --> 24:58.600
one coefficient

24:58.600 --> 25:00.600
and control

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
its normative value.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
Thus,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
the weekend parameters

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
of financial forecasting,

25:08.600 --> 25:10.600
strategic financial planning

25:10.800 --> 25:12.800
and the next stage

25:12.800 --> 25:14.800
of current planning

25:14.800 --> 25:16.800
are the amount

25:16.800 --> 25:18.800
of investments,

25:18.800 --> 25:20.800
which determines the structure

25:20.800 --> 25:22.800
of assets,

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
sources of financing,

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
and, accordingly, the structure

25:26.800 --> 25:28.800
of passive capital,

25:28.800 --> 25:30.800
the accumulation of profits

25:30.800 --> 25:32.800
and the pure money flow.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
We will now consider

25:42.800 --> 25:44.800
the tactic of financial planning.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
The tactic is developed

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
as an answer to the question

25:48.800 --> 25:50.800
what we need to do

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
at our enterprise

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
to implement the strategy.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.800
And as an answer

25:56.800 --> 25:58.800
we set the task of current financial planning

25:58.800 --> 26:00.800
to ensure financial balance.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
Please look

26:02.800 --> 26:04.800
at the next slide.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.800
The image in the form of scales

26:06.800 --> 26:08.800
shows financial balance.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It is a state

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
that allows

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
the enterprise to achieve

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
the goals set

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and to balance

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
between two components

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
of the enterprise.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It is the balance between

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
the pursuit of profitability

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
and the avoidance of risk,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
between profitability and liquidity.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
We see a cornerstone

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
in the center of the slide

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
that is the condition

26:37.200 --> 26:39.200
of financial balance.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
This condition forms strategic solutions

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
in the process of

26:43.200 --> 26:45.200
future planning

26:45.200 --> 26:47.200
that are decided

26:47.200 --> 26:49.200
on investments and financing.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
That is,

26:51.200 --> 26:53.200
financial balance is based

26:53.200 --> 26:55.200
on a balanced structure of capital,

26:55.200 --> 26:57.200
on financial stability.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.200
We recall the rules of financing

27:01.200 --> 27:03.200
and it is the compliance

27:03.200 --> 27:05.200
of these rules

27:05.400 --> 27:07.400
that determines

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
our financial stability

27:09.400 --> 27:11.400
and creates conditions

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
for the balance

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
between liquidity and profitability.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
Financial stability

27:17.400 --> 27:19.400
is the ability

27:19.400 --> 27:21.400
of the enterprise

27:21.400 --> 27:23.400
to maintain independence

27:23.400 --> 27:25.400
when changes occur in the financial markets,

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
to maintain independence

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
from creditors,

27:29.400 --> 27:31.400
to maintain independence.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
Financial stability

27:33.600 --> 27:35.600
is our rule

27:35.600 --> 27:37.600
50-50

27:37.600 --> 27:39.600
and the corresponding coefficients

27:39.600 --> 27:41.600
that can be calculated

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
on the predicted balance of the enterprise

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
based on the results

27:45.600 --> 27:47.600
of strategic planning.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.600
This is the coefficient of financial activity

27:49.600 --> 27:51.600
or sometimes called

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
the financial shoulder,

27:53.600 --> 27:55.600
the coefficient of financial dependence,

27:55.600 --> 27:57.600
the level of one's own capital.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.600
You see

27:59.600 --> 28:01.600
in the calculation scheme

28:01.800 --> 28:03.800
the coefficients are interconnected

28:03.800 --> 28:05.800
and all of them

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
are based on the rule

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
that one's own capital

28:09.800 --> 28:11.800
must exceed the borrowed capital.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
For example,

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
we can consider an enterprise

28:15.800 --> 28:17.800
to be absolutely stable

28:17.800 --> 28:19.800
but it is rare

28:19.800 --> 28:21.800
to find such an enterprise

28:21.800 --> 28:23.800
that uses only its own funds

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
and has no borrowed funds

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
at all.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.800
Normal financial stability

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
is the compliance

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
of the financing rules.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
One-to-one, one's own

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and borrowed funds are used equally.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And the unstable financial situation

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
is when an enterprise

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
uses additional

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
unreasonable sources

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
to cover some of the reserves

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and the financial situation

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
is critical

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
when the enterprise

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
has unpaid loans

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and overdue debts.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.200
An enterprise is not

29:00.200 --> 29:02.200
payable.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.200
Our financial scales

29:04.200 --> 29:06.200
are shifting.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.200
Liquidity

29:08.200 --> 29:10.200
is falling

29:10.200 --> 29:12.200
in this picture.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.200
In general,

29:14.200 --> 29:16.200
liquidity is a rather problematic

29:16.200 --> 29:18.200
category both in theory and in practice.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.200
Theoretically,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.200
this concept is considered

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
in the broad and narrow sense.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.200
In the broad sense

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
liquidity is a compliance

29:28.400 --> 29:30.400
of the money flows.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
We talked about it at the beginning

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
of the presentation of the financial enterprise

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
from the point of view of the movement

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
of the money flows.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
From this point of view,

29:40.400 --> 29:42.400
liquidity can be identified

29:42.400 --> 29:44.400
as financial stability.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
Long-term liquidity

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
is a structural liquidity

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
that is obtained

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
as a result of

29:52.400 --> 29:54.400
making decisions

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
and financing.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
On the other hand,

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
liquidity is often understood

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
as something close to payability.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
Liquidity is a current

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
condition of payment

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
affordability.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.600
Another concept

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
of liquidity

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
is the turnover

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
of current assets.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
This is the ability of assets

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
to transform

30:22.800 --> 30:24.800
into liquid assets

30:24.800 --> 30:26.800
and money.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
The problem

30:28.800 --> 30:30.800
of liquidity indicators

30:30.800 --> 30:32.800
is that

30:32.800 --> 30:34.800
in practice

30:34.800 --> 30:36.800
there is always a question

30:36.800 --> 30:38.800
about their normative level.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
What enterprise

30:40.800 --> 30:42.800
can be considered

30:42.800 --> 30:44.800
good from the point of view

30:44.800 --> 30:46.800
of liquidity?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
Attempts to introduce

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
some general concepts,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
rules, and coefficients

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
are not sustainable.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Liquidity is a characteristic

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
that largely depends

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
on the business

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
property of the enterprise.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
The requirement

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
of the current liquidity

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
coefficient,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
which should be

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
greater than 2,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
is not to be

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
criticized.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We have talked a lot about this,

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
but liquidity is the only

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
official financial normative

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
that exists.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.200
Of course,

31:27.200 --> 31:29.200
violation of financial balance

31:29.200 --> 31:31.200
and distortions

31:31.200 --> 31:33.200
in one or the other direction

31:33.200 --> 31:35.200
can lead

31:35.200 --> 31:37.200
to risky and critical situations,

31:37.200 --> 31:39.200
to unpayment,

31:39.200 --> 31:41.200
to bankruptcy.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.200
I would like to draw your attention

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
to the fact that

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
we have already discussed

31:49.400 --> 31:51.400
these courses in other topics

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
of financial management.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.400
It is important for us to understand

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
that the concepts of financial stability

31:57.400 --> 31:59.400
and liquidity are,

31:59.400 --> 32:01.400
in economic terms,

32:01.400 --> 32:03.400
interconnected and

32:03.400 --> 32:05.400
derive from the compliance

32:05.400 --> 32:07.400
of financing rules.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
They connect the structure

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
of assets and the structure

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
of passives.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.400
The degree of unprofitability

32:15.600 --> 32:17.600
of the enterprise

32:17.600 --> 32:19.600
can be controlled

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
by the absence of money

32:21.600 --> 32:23.600
on the enterprise's account

32:23.600 --> 32:25.600
and by overdue debts.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.600
In our realities,

32:27.600 --> 32:29.600
the critical term of payment

32:29.600 --> 32:31.600
is 3 months.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.600
According to the law of bankruptcy,

32:33.600 --> 32:35.600
in this sad case,

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
the enterprise can be

32:37.600 --> 32:39.600
responsible

32:39.600 --> 32:41.600
for its costs,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
including financial planning

32:43.800 --> 32:45.800
costs.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.800
The case of bankruptcy

32:47.800 --> 32:49.800
can be brought against it.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.800
These indicators

32:51.800 --> 32:53.800
of financial stability, liquidity,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.800
profitability

32:55.800 --> 32:57.800
for financial planning

32:57.800 --> 32:59.800
are needed as limiters

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
of the risk level.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.800
On the opposite side of the scales

33:03.800 --> 33:05.800
we have indicators of efficiency,

33:05.800 --> 33:07.800
profitability, profitability

33:07.800 --> 33:09.800
and turnover.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.800
Or,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
for example,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
if the enterprise

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
takes an aggressive policy

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
to increase the share of the market.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
This is a real goal,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
an interesting task,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
a necessary one.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It plans

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
to increase the production volumes

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
according to this strategy.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It plans additional

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
investments in production capacity.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
In the case of changes

33:40.200 --> 33:42.200
in the market,

33:42.200 --> 33:44.200
for example,

33:44.200 --> 33:46.200
some shocks,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.200
we are familiar with this,

33:48.200 --> 33:50.200
the reduction of the payable demand

33:50.200 --> 33:52.200
and the inability to produce

33:52.200 --> 33:54.200
in the planned volumes,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.200
there are losses

33:56.200 --> 33:58.200
due to the operation lever.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.200
Another risky

34:00.200 --> 34:02.200
situation is

34:02.200 --> 34:04.200
when the enterprise uses additional loans

34:04.200 --> 34:06.200
in order to ensure

34:06.200 --> 34:08.200
the planned

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
volumes.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.400
The increase in the volumes of sales

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
of additional loans can lead

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
to financial stability losses

34:16.400 --> 34:18.400
due to the operation of the financial lever.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.400
High profitability

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
of assets is another

34:22.400 --> 34:24.400
goal,

34:24.400 --> 34:26.400
a goal of profitability,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
a goal of ensuring

34:28.400 --> 34:30.400
the effectiveness of the enterprise.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
It can be achieved

34:32.400 --> 34:34.400
by minimizing the reserves.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.400
Minimal reserves

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
are vulnerable to breakdowns.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
At some point

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
we may not have enough money

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
to buy a new batch of goods,

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
we may not have

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
the components

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
for production launches.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
Or even

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
if we have

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
a new client,

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
we must somehow satisfy

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
his demand

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
and provide

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
his products,

35:04.800 --> 35:06.800
but we do not have such products.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.800
We lose the products.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.800
Thus, we can

35:10.800 --> 35:12.800
schematically imagine

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
that the current financial planning

35:14.800 --> 35:16.800
should ensure

35:16.800 --> 35:18.800
in total

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
both the parameters of efficiency

35:20.800 --> 35:22.800
of the enterprise, profitability,

35:22.800 --> 35:24.800
and financial stability,

35:24.800 --> 35:26.800
liquidity,

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
and paymentability.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.800
All this, of course,

35:30.800 --> 35:32.800
is aimed at

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
increasing the market value

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
of the enterprise.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Now,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
after we have discussed

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
the basics of the current planning,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I would like to ask you

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
to look at the accountability of your enterprise,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
the available forms of accountability,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
the 1 and 2 forms of public accountability,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
when you always have them

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
at hand,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
you can get them.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
What is striking

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in terms of financial stability

36:01.200 --> 36:03.200
and liquidity?

36:03.200 --> 36:05.200
Do you have,

36:05.200 --> 36:07.200
when you know the parameters,

36:07.200 --> 36:09.200
do you have a threat of paymentability?

36:09.200 --> 36:11.200
A more complete analysis

36:11.200 --> 36:13.200
will allow you to identify

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
the problem areas

36:15.200 --> 36:17.200
and set the task of changing the tactics,

36:17.200 --> 36:19.200
outline the normative level of tasks

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
for planning for the future.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.200
So, friends,

36:33.200 --> 36:35.200
we have discussed the strategic parameters

36:35.200 --> 36:37.200
of planning,

36:37.200 --> 36:39.200
the planning tactics,

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
and now we move on to the operational planning

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
and consider

36:43.200 --> 36:45.200
the parameters of operational management.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.200
I define

36:47.200 --> 36:49.200
the financial cycle

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
with such parameters.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
The financial cycle is the period

36:53.200 --> 36:55.200
of money transfer,

36:55.200 --> 36:57.200
the time during which the money

36:57.200 --> 36:59.200
is withdrawn from the turnover.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.400
This is the period

37:01.400 --> 37:03.400
between the withdrawal of funds

37:03.400 --> 37:05.400
and the inflow of funds.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
On the slide,

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
you can see the component

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
of the financial cycle

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
and you can see

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
that the financial cycle

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
is superimposed

37:17.400 --> 37:19.400
on the operational cycle

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
due to the fact that we can

37:21.400 --> 37:23.400
receive a repayment

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
for the supply of resources.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.600
The component

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
of the financial cycle

37:29.600 --> 37:31.600
requires optimization.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.600
The maximum reduction

37:33.600 --> 37:35.600
of the financial cycle

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
is the main increase

37:37.600 --> 37:39.600
in the cost of the business

37:39.600 --> 37:41.600
for the lower level of management.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
But, of course,

37:43.600 --> 37:45.600
there are some limits.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
We cannot reduce it

37:47.600 --> 37:49.600
to infinity.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
Therefore, we need

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
to combine

37:53.800 --> 37:55.800
the parameters

37:55.800 --> 37:57.800
of the financial activity

37:57.800 --> 37:59.800
with the parameters

37:59.800 --> 38:01.800
of the operational cycle.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.800
For example,

38:03.800 --> 38:05.800
we consider

38:05.800 --> 38:07.800
the following parameters

38:07.800 --> 38:09.800
in terms of the main components

38:09.800 --> 38:11.800
of the activity

38:11.800 --> 38:13.800
– procurement, production,

38:13.800 --> 38:15.800
operational sphere and sales.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.800
In the case of repurchase,

38:17.800 --> 38:19.800
the norm of the reserve

38:19.800 --> 38:21.800
is the following.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
The day

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
is the indicator

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
of the periodicity

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
of the supply.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The norm of the reserve

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
is the days

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
for which we create a reserve

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
in order to ensure

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
the minimum, but sufficient level

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
for the interval of time

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
between one and the other supply.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
This is the management norm

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
that is clear

38:50.200 --> 38:52.200
in the sphere of material and technical

38:52.200 --> 38:54.200
provision.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.200
In the financial sphere,

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
it is represented

38:58.200 --> 39:00.200
in the form of the cost of the reserves

39:00.200 --> 39:02.200
and is added up

39:02.200 --> 39:04.200
as a result of a certain

39:04.200 --> 39:06.200
payment period

39:06.200 --> 39:08.200
that we receive

39:08.200 --> 39:10.200
for the supply of resources.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.200
The next sphere of activity

39:16.200 --> 39:18.200
is the operational sphere

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
of the production cycle.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.400
The most important norm

39:22.400 --> 39:24.400
of operational management

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
is the duration of the production cycle,

39:26.400 --> 39:28.400
the interval of time

39:28.400 --> 39:30.400
between the launch

39:30.400 --> 39:32.400
and the moment

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
of the ready-made product

39:34.400 --> 39:36.400
being received.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.400
The financial indicator

39:38.400 --> 39:40.400
of the corresponding duration

39:40.400 --> 39:42.400
of the production cycle

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
is the cost of the unfinished production.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.400
The shorter the cycle,

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
the more organized

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
the production activity of the enterprise is.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
In the sphere of sales,

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
the important operative norm

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
of management

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
is the norm of the ready-made product reserve.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.600
The ready-made product

40:00.600 --> 40:02.600
is stored in the warehouse

40:02.600 --> 40:04.600
for a certain time

40:04.600 --> 40:06.600
inevitably.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.600
For each enterprise,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.600
there is a certain

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
average period

40:12.600 --> 40:14.600
specific to this industry.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.800
On the other hand,

40:16.800 --> 40:18.800
in the financial sphere,

40:18.800 --> 40:20.800
we have

40:20.800 --> 40:22.800
a debitor's debt,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.800
which is formed

40:24.800 --> 40:26.800
due to the delay of payments.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.800
The financial indicator

40:28.800 --> 40:30.800
of the ready-made product reserve

40:30.800 --> 40:32.800
is the cost of the ready-made

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
product reserve.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.800
These norms

40:36.800 --> 40:38.800
form

40:38.800 --> 40:40.800
the duration

40:40.800 --> 40:42.800
of the financial cycle.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
For example,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
how do these indicators

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
work within the framework

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
of planning?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
If we planned

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
according to the parameters of the annual plan,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the current plan,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
the duration of the financial cycle is 30 days

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
for all components.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
In reality,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
in six months,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
the condition of sales has worsened

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
and payments for our product

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
will be made for several days,

41:11.200 --> 41:13.200
for example, for 10 days later.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.200
From a financial point of view,

41:15.200 --> 41:17.200
this means a risk

41:17.200 --> 41:19.200
of liquidity disruption.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.200
That is,

41:21.200 --> 41:23.200
we have a lag of time

41:23.200 --> 41:25.200
that needs to be closed

41:25.200 --> 41:27.200
by something

41:27.200 --> 41:29.200
or by capital,

41:29.200 --> 41:31.200
but this is an extreme measure,

41:31.200 --> 41:33.200
undesirable,

41:33.200 --> 41:35.200
or it is necessary to put tasks

41:35.200 --> 41:37.200
before production units

41:37.200 --> 41:39.200
and to tighten some norms

41:39.400 --> 41:41.400
in certain stages.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.400
For example,

41:43.400 --> 41:45.400
to put tasks

41:45.400 --> 41:47.400
before technologists

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
and before the production organizers

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
and to tighten the production process

41:51.400 --> 41:53.400
and production processes

41:53.400 --> 41:55.400
for these days.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.400
If this does not work,

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
then we will have to take additional loans

41:59.400 --> 42:01.400
and, of course,

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
to bear additional costs.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
The big problem of managing

42:05.400 --> 42:07.400
cash funds

42:07.600 --> 42:09.600
is related to the instability

42:09.600 --> 42:11.600
of the calculations,

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
especially if the enterprise

42:13.600 --> 42:15.600
has some seasonality,

42:15.600 --> 42:17.600
instability of production,

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
companies that work by contracts.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.600
For example,

42:21.600 --> 42:23.600
for construction companies

42:23.600 --> 42:25.600
that are active

42:25.600 --> 42:27.600
in the summer,

42:27.600 --> 42:29.600
and money is received

42:29.600 --> 42:31.600
from August to December

42:31.600 --> 42:33.600
for new projects

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
the following autumn,

42:35.800 --> 42:37.800
as a result, cash breaks are formed

42:37.800 --> 42:39.800
and it is necessary to plan

42:39.800 --> 42:41.800
the coverage of cash breaks

42:41.800 --> 42:43.800
and to receive additional loans.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.800
I hope you have already calculated

42:49.800 --> 42:51.800
in your mind

42:51.800 --> 42:53.800
the duration of the financial cycle

42:53.800 --> 42:55.800
of your company.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
An interesting situation

42:57.800 --> 42:59.800
is when the financial cycle

42:59.800 --> 43:01.800
is negative.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.800
What does this mean?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
This is the dream

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
of any financial management.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
This is how large supermarkets work.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The condition is a half-year

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
repayment of payments

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
for the supply of products.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
This is a common condition

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
for the largest supermarkets.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
As a result,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
from the financial cycle,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
they have only one problem

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
– managing reserves.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And this is a problem

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
that is not solved

43:32.200 --> 43:34.200
by the government.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
To solve this problem,

43:36.200 --> 43:38.200
the reserves are kept at a normal level

43:38.200 --> 43:40.200
and the excess reserves

43:40.200 --> 43:42.200
are sold at low,

43:42.200 --> 43:44.200
so to say,

43:44.200 --> 43:46.200
discount prices.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.200
Therefore, this expression

43:48.200 --> 43:50.200
and the stereotype

43:50.200 --> 43:52.200
that you can buy good,

43:52.200 --> 43:54.200
cheap, high-quality things

43:54.200 --> 43:56.200
is related to the era of the deficit.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
Today we already know

43:58.200 --> 44:00.200
what is possible,

44:00.400 --> 44:02.400
but we do not know

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
how to solve this problem.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
I would like to ask you

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
to make a long-term plan

44:08.400 --> 44:10.400
for your company

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
and calculate the operational

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
and financial cycle.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.400
Maybe something can be changed.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
I hope that the delay

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
when buying goods

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
that your suppliers

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
provide to you

44:24.400 --> 44:26.400
and the delay

44:26.400 --> 44:28.400
when supplying resources

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
exceeds the delay

44:30.600 --> 44:32.600
that you provide

44:32.600 --> 44:34.600
to your customers

44:34.600 --> 44:36.600
for your products and services.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
If not,

44:38.600 --> 44:40.600
we can say right away

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
that the success of the planning

44:42.600 --> 44:44.600
will most likely be unsuccessful.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.600
I have also selected

44:46.600 --> 44:48.600
for you examples

44:48.600 --> 44:50.600
of managing the financial cycle

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
in the companies

44:52.600 --> 44:54.600
of Metra Cash & Carry, IBM,

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
Ford, General Motors and others.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.800
Stay curious!
