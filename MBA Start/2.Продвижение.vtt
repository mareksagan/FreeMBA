00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What are the main methods of selling?

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, now we will look at the sales stimulation.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Probably the biggest and most basic block,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
because today we found out that the BTL methods,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
the methods of selling, are more and more active,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
more active in the market,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
bring more and more results,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
because the situation in the market is developing in this way.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's see what are the main methods of selling stimulation.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
Here is a chain of goods from the manufacturer to the buyer.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And there we see several links.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
After the manufacturer, we have a distributor,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
if it is not there, maybe there is a dealer,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
and the next is the wholesale,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
and the next is the trading link,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
which brings our goods to the buyer.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
So, the best way to stimulate the sale is to do it in a complex way,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
starting from the manufacturer,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
starting from the company itself,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
and ending with the company that offers your goods to the market,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
that is, with the trading point.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
If you have at least one link,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
especially when it comes to the export of new goods to the market,

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
then the whole company may not have the proper effect or fail,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
because by stimulating one or two of the chains,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
our chain does not exist, it breaks.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Someone from the companies that present our goods to the market is not motivated.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Since there is no motivation for sales,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
they just do not do it,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
or do not do it the way we would like.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Spending one or another means, we do not get the result,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
because there is no complex impact on the market.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
What are the main methods of stimulation?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
The first is the trade marketing programs,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
which are aimed at the trading link.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
The dealer, distributors, wholesale sellers,

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
and retail trading networks or shops that offer goods to the market are related to the trading link.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
The second is direct marketing,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
which we will definitely talk about today.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
These are merchandising events that are held at trading points.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
They are also related to the stimulation of sales.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Competent merchandising allows you to increase sales from 80% to 300%.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
This is a very large resource in the hands of the company.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And, of course, another method is consumer promotion.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
These are events aimed at the end consumer,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
because they stimulate the trading link.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
We provide you with products on shelves,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
but we will not encourage our customer to buy our product.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Therefore, of course, with a complex impact and impact on the end consumer,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
it is just as important and necessary.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Let's first consider the goals.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
The main goals that pursue the stimulation of sales.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
The first goal or group of goals, the most important one,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
is, of course, to increase sales volumes,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
increase sales volumes or accelerate the company's product turnover.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
This group has a list of certain goals,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
which is presented on your slide and in your workbooks.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
What goals can be achieved by stimulating this group?

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
The first goal is to introduce a new product to the market.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
This is the main goal.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
The second goal is to sell the product, for example,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
at the end of the season or with a delayed shelf life.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
We can also set such a goal here.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
The third goal is to accelerate the purchase,

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
that is, to buy a particular product more often

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
or increase the volume.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Previously, we bought a certain amount,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
now we want to buy twice as much, for example.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Remember, for example, shampoo.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
Previously, it was said that shampoo was intended only to wash the head once or twice a week.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Now we see that the bottle says that shampoo is for daily use.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
This is just an increase in the volume of purchases.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
That is, we buy shampoo much more than before.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
This is how you can give an example with any product.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay, the next group of goals that we will consider.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
The next group of goals is to implement the communication pyramid.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
What is the communication pyramid?

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
When we see a product, we go through several stages.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
The first is awareness.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
We just learn about this product, that there is such a product.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
But we don't know what kind of product it is yet.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The next stage is information.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
When we study more deeply the information about this product,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
we learn how it can be used, why, for what, and so on.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
The next stage is attitude to the brand.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
We have already looked at what kind of product it is,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
and we develop our attitude, positive or negative.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
After that, we only make a decision about the purchase.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Will we buy this product or not?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
What are the goals for this group?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
The first goal is, of course, getting acquainted with the company.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Because first we need to know about the company.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
The next goal is getting acquainted with the product,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
which we can put to a certain number of consumers.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
One of the goals can be to make a trial purchase.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Sometimes it is very important when we introduce a new product to the market.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
First, our buyers should try this product,

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
and then understand whether they need it or not in the future

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
in order to make a second purchase.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Of course, deepening the knowledge about the product

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
can also be a goal when we tell about its properties.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And, of course, increasing the number of visitors

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
to a particular point of sale can also be a goal.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
The goals that are described here

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
can be used when planning events for promotion,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
only adding numbers and deadlines.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
These are ready-made goals that will help you

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
to determine what you want in this market.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And now we will look at two more groups of goals.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
The next group of goals is product positioning

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
and positioning.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
This group of goals is used when we plan to launch a new brand

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
and make a future brand out of it.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Then, of course, it is important to us

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
how we will position our product,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
what the buyers will think about it,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
and how we will confirm the positioning that we offer them for this product.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
What goals can be here?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Of course, attracting customers to a certain segment.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Because we do positioning for each segment separately.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Remember, we said that each segment

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
presents its own requirements for the product.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Based on these requirements,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
we determine the positioning of the product.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The next point is, of course,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
to consolidate the image of the product with the knowledge of the buyer.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
This is how various support actions are held

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
to remind our product,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
to remind our image,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
our advertising slogan,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
our product idea,

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
so that the buyers have the so-called knowledge without a hint.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
For example, you are asked

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
what beer brands you like.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And you call those brands without a hint

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
the ones that are produced by the company that conducts this survey.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Thus, this is the knowledge without a hint.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
This is what all manufacturers want to achieve.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Because this is the main key to success.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
You are known, and, accordingly, some part of it is bought.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And another group of goals that we will consider

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
is to maintain and increase the market share.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
In short, there are two goals that can be set in this subgroup.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
The first is to maintain the market share.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Usually, this goal is set in the high season,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
because all companies hold promotions,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and we need to maintain at least our share,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
or maybe increase it,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and take away from the competitor part of our buyers.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And another goal is to switch

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
the buyers from the competitor's trademark

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
to our trademark.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
This must be done very carefully,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
but nevertheless, many companies do it,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and many achieve success.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, we have considered the main groups of goals,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
and you can use them, as I said,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
by setting numbers and deadlines.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
And now let's look at the main tools

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
for stimulating sales or the main tools of trade marketing.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
We will start with considering the tools

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
for stimulating sales.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The first is, of course,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
various discounts and bonuses

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
that we offer to our clients.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Discounts can be both volumetric, seasonal,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
and holiday, and for a comprehensive purchase,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
and for encouraging the sale of a new product,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
whatever we do to make our client

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
interested in working with us.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But there are also bonuses.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Bonuses often work even better than discounts,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
because a bonus is a certain bonus

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
for completing a task,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and by setting a correct task,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
we get a very effective result.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
What are the bonuses?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
We can offer bonuses for increasing the distribution,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
for the sale of a certain top assortment,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
for the execution of a set plan,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
which, of course, needs to be pursued.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It can be a team bonus,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
which is given for the execution,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
for example, of a certain plan

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
to your clients,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
which will encourage the activity

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
of all employees, all team members.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Actually, bonuses are considered

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
more effective than discounts today.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Nevertheless, you can't avoid discounts.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
This is a standard tool for stimulating sales.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Let's consider two more tools.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
These are special events and merchandising,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
which we have already talked about.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
What do special events have to do with them?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Special events are the most common

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
for companies to participate in.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Naturally, you need to prepare for them

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
very well, precisely, and set tasks

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
and monitor their execution.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Special events are not only an image moment,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
although, of course,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
you can't remove the image moment.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
An event cannot give an instant increase

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
in sales volumes,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
but an increase in the client base,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
which is a goal for the company

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
to increase sales or promote new products.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The next special event is

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
a presentation of new products,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
training inside the company of your clients,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
which must be held

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
in order to maintain the information level,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
knowledge of your product,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
loyalty to the company, awareness.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
The same way,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
this event is held by the company

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
in an obligatory order.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
There are also various professional conferences,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
press conferences,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
various trainings, seminars,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
which are dedicated to your product

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
or are connected with your product.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
The next tool is merchandising,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
which, as I said,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
allows you to increase sales

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
from 80% to 300%.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
This is only in my practice.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I had more numbers.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Nevertheless, what does merchandising allow?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
It allows you to make a competent product layout,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
to present POS materials,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
which will inform the client

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
about the events,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
discounts, bonuses,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
information about the new product.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
These are various lottery competitions

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
held at the sales place,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
at the trading point.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
This is advertising at the sales place,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
which will also help to draw attention

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
to your product.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
These are sales consultants,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
who will certainly increase sales

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
of your product several times

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
if they work competently and professionally.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
We will talk about this later.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, let's consider the main objects

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
of the impact of trade marketing programs.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Who do we influence and who do we work for?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Here is the whole chain in front of you.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
As I said,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
the main objects of the chain are your own staff.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You need to start with them.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Especially if you introduce a new product.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Focus on this.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Not a single trading staff of a company,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
even if it is very loyal to the management of the company,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
will not be pleased with the appearance of a new product.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Because it is difficult to sell it,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
and you should pay special attention to this.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
If you introduce a new product to the market,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
you will lose your own trading staff.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yes, they get a bonus or a percentage

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
of the sales volume they have made.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
But this is not all.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
One thing is to sell a well-known product,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
which does not require any special effort

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
to pay for its own cost.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
The buyers themselves ask for it,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
they buy it, and our sales managers

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
will successfully implement the product

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
that they sell themselves.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And they will not pay attention

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
to your new product.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
This is a problem from the point of view

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
that it should be presented correctly,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
positioned correctly,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
and the competitors should tell

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
about the competitive advantages of a new product.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Otherwise, how can you convince a buyer

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
to take it and try it?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
After all, the buyer also has a risk.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
He invests funds that are not known

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
whether they will return quickly.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And fast turnover is one of the tasks

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
of any buyer.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Therefore, by putting all links

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
of your chain at risk

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
when you introduce a new product,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
we must take into account

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
that our sales managers

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
will play a key role here.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And when you introduce a new product,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
you must start working with them.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Then, when your product

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
is already in the stable line,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
it is not necessary to do this.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Sometimes you can hold

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
supportive events

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
in the form of contests,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
various bonuses,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
in order to remind

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
what needs to be done.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
But you will not need

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
constant stimulation.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
It is only necessary at the very first stage.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
The next person

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
who enters this chain

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
is a branch network or a distributor,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
depending on what your company has.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Maybe you have branches,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
maybe not, but in any case

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
there are intermediaries

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
who must be stimulated in the same way.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Because the same law works here.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
What is already known

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
or is already known,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
or is sold well.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Therefore, in order to reduce risks,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
we give discounts, we give bonuses,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
we come up with various programs.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And this is justified.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Why do those companies

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
that work in the market

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
and are not holders of the brand

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
have to bear certain risks?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
We must pay for these risks.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Because we are the initiators

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
of a particular process,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
a particular product

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
and a particular product.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
The entire trading chain,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
which is indicated here on the slide,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
must necessarily think through

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
the whole chain of sales stimulation.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Otherwise, as I said,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
when any of these links

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
fall out,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
you will not achieve

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
a comprehensive result

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
and there will be no synergy

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
from your actions.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Let's look at the main methods of stimulation.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
They are divided into two main groups.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
The first one we will consider

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
is the price methods.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And the first of the price methods

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
is our favorite seasonal discount,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
which we give.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Almost any company does this.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
As I said,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
in the high season,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
the discount is additional

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
in order to capture or retain

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
its share of the market.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And in the low season,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
when there is practically no sale

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
or they sharply decrease,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the discount is used quite often.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The next discount is the holiday discount,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
which is also particularly popular.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Our clients, our customers

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
are waiting for seasonal discounts.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Remember the New Year's sales.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Yes, we give discounts,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
but what is the turnover we get?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
After all, according to the statistics,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
sales in the New Year increase by 250%

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
compared to the average sales volume

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
per month.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Therefore, such a discount is justified.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
We earn due to the turnover.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
If your product has a certain shelf life,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
if it has a seasonal direction,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
of course, a discount allows us

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to keep a balance

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
on the stock of our products.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
The next discount is

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
a loss leader.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
What is this discount?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Remember such things.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You are driving along the highway

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and suddenly there is an advertisement

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and it is written

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
that there is a crossroad

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
in the shopping network

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and today a watermelon

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
costs 3 rubles per kilogram.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And you think,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
how great, if a watermelon

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
costs so cheaply,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
then everything else is probably

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
at a similar price.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And so we get hooked.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This discount is called

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
or this program is called a loss leader.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
When we take the product

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
and the leader in sales,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in turnover,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
the most popular in this period,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
we set the price to the cost,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and we earn on other products,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
because we set higher prices

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
on other products.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
This is a very well-working method

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
and almost all buyers

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
come across it.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
The next discount is

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
a discrimination discount.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
What is this discount?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Remember when you come to the museum

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and what you see there.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Children are free,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
citizens of the Russian Federation

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
are free,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and the price is 500 rubles.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Here is a discrimination discount.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
When you set the price

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
for the same product

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
for different categories of consumers,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
such a system

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
works not only in museums.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Now it is very active,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
for example, in the services

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
of air transport,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when, for example, young people

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
under 25 years old

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
are given a discount on a ticket

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and you can buy

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
two tickets back and forth

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
at the price of one.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
These are very good programs

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
that work great

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and are very actively used abroad.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
The next discount is

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
a discount for a large volume.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This discount is also standard,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
as well as seasonal,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and is used by almost all companies

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
that work in the market.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
When we set certain turnover

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and thus stimulate

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
the sale of a product,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
the discount is standard,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
is used often,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and works in one way or another.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The next discount is a discount on time.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Remember, in stores

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
a happy hour,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
or, for example,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
from the 1st to the 15th

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
there will be such a discount,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and from the 15th to the 30th

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
there will be less.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Thus, you are encouraged

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
to buy a particular product

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Distributor companies

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
use such a discount

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
before New Year's sales.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
They usually say

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
that in November there will be a discount

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
to unload supplies,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
to unload their logistics,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
so that, for example,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
most companies buy in November,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and not in December.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
This is how you can use this discount.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
The next discount is discount or gift cards.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, probably,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
many of us now have different cards,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
discount or gift cards.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
In any store it already works.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
In some stores,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
loyalty programs work.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But this is not a price method.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But there is still a discount.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Most often it is a deposit.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And we use it one way or another.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
This makes us

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
return to certain stores,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
which means it works.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But one more thing.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
This is a sale of loans.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
This is a very developing area.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
There are a lot of consumer loans now.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It is even difficult to name a product

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
that is not being sold on credit.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Almost everything.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
As long as you are able to pay a loan,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
as long as you have a good credit history,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
if you have it,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and as long as you are ready to buy on credit.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Otherwise,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
this is a very good method

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
to stimulate the sale of your product.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
For example, you sell some equipment.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Of course, you will immediately increase

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
sales if a person makes an offer.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
You don't need to pay now.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
You take the product,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
but you will pay later.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
This is very good for our customers.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And now let's look at

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
the main non-price methods.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They are just as popular

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
as the price ones,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
but have a slightly different nature.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We do not play at the price,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
but play on various gifts, bonuses,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and so on. Let's see.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The first method is

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
credit cards.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
This is not a discount.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
For example,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
you come to a store where men's underpants are sold.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You buy one or two of them.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And you are given virtual money

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
with the amount written on it.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
For example,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
200, 300, 500 rubles.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And you are told that the next time

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you buy another pair of underpants,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
you can use this card

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
as a credit.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
This amount will be taken as a credit

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
as internal money of the client.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
This is the same method that makes

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
the client come back.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Free samples or sampling

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
work very well

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
when new goods are brought to the market.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
When you offer your products

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
to try in small versions,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
in miniatures,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
samples are given

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
or free samples that the client

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
tries and decides for himself

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
whether this product is interesting

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
or not. In fact,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
free samples can be used

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
when we give a free product

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
or a so-called free product

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
in quotes,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
from money.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
If the company

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
buys a certain amount of products,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
then so many free samples

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
are attached to it.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
This works very well

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
because it allows the first company

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
to try the product itself,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
the second company

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
to sell this product,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and the third company

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
to give it to someone

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
to gain loyalty.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
There are many ways

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
to use this data.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It works very well

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
for both end users

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
and for the trading link.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I highly recommend it.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
The next method

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
is a gift.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
You give a gift

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
to a certain product,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
a necessary thing for the client.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The word necessary is the key word

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
because if this gift is not necessary,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
for example,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
you may remember

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
that a year or two ago

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
there was an advertisement

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
about a cap as a gift

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
when buying an apartment.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It was funny, but everyone remembered it.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
However, the gift was completely useless.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So, please,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
evaluate what kind of gift you have,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
whether it will be useful.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And one more point.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The cost of the gift

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
is more than 30% of the product's cost.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Otherwise, your customers

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
will ask

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
why such expensive gifts

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
are given.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
We all understand that it is a cost.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So, be careful with the amount of the gift.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The gift should not be more expensive

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
than the product itself.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The next method is a bonus

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
that we give for the performance of a certain bonus.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
For example,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
your distributor sold

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
a certain number of products

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and got a certain number of new customers

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
that you planned for him.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You can pay him a bonus

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
for this,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
for which he will be very grateful to you,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
of course,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
and will continue

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
working with you as a partner.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
The bonus can be not only money,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
but it can be

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
various gifts,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
for example,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
trips

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
or some interesting things

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
that will be interesting

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
to the customer.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
For example, I can give you

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
an example of a wine company

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
that held a competition

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
among...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The next point is

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
the competition and games.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
The wine company held a competition

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
for the month of Argentine wine.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It was three years ago,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
but the competition was very interesting

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and inexpensive.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
They held a competition for the best wholesalers

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
and the number of winners

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
was not one, not two,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
but as many as 15.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The winning companies

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
were offered

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
to go, for example,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
to a trip

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
to a competition

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
in Formula 1,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
or to the World Cup,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
or to the Brazilian Carnival.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Try to find such ideas

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
that will be interesting to the customer.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Not just a trip to Turkey.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
It's also pleasant,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
but it's something interesting

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
that you won't go to

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
very often.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Such unusual offers

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
make you participate

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
in such competitions

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
and games

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
and fight for such prizes.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The next point is

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
the increased warranty period.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
We have an increased warranty

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
for this product,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
and the customer likes it.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You can't ruin yourself

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
with this product,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
because it should be of high quality

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and meet the requirements.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
If you get a return on the product,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
you won't be able to cope

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
with such a high flow.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Very carefully,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
increase the warranty period.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Although it works great

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
for the customer.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
The next method is the lottery.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's also a good method

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
because it's inexpensive.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The winner of the lottery

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
is only one or two clients.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Of course, the costs are small,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
but there are many participants.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
But the lottery has one feature.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
You must register it

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
in the state authorities.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
If the prize amount

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
is more than 3,000 rubles,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
your client will have to pay taxes.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So be careful with this.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You can get a fine

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
if you use it improperly.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Another idea,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
another method is

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
joining a club.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
There are many clubs now.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
There are clubs of different interests,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
clubs of the same brand,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
clubs of football fans,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
clubs of famous personalities.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You can work with all these clubs

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
in terms of promotion

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
of the product.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And the second method

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
is to create your own club

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
where your clients will be interested.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Many online stores

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
have announced

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
reading clubs.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
They give discounts

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
to the products.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It's interesting for people.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Not everyone can join it.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
The exclusivity of the club

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
is determined by the fact

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
that not everyone can join it,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
but only a person or a company

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
that is determined

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
by special criteria

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
that you will determine.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
The membership in the club

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
should be interesting and exclusive.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Otherwise it will be not a club,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
but a gathering of people

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
and companies.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And it won't be interesting.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Another method is to attract

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
a friend.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Many companies now

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
make loyalty programs

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
and give you discount cards.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's great,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
because we increase

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the number of potential clients.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It's nice to give a discount card

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to a friend,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
even if he hasn't participated

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
in a certain promotion.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
It will encourage him

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
to participate in a certain event

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
and buy a certain product.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
If you have such an opportunity,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I recommend you to use it.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
We have discussed the main methods

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
of stimulation.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But since there are so many of them,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
how to make the right choice?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
What should we pay attention to?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
In your lecture material

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I will explain the method of stimulation.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It will help you to decide

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
what you need.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I want to draw your attention

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
to the consideration of this algorithm.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
All methods of stimulation

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
are divided into two groups.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
They are called

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
solid and selective stimulation.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Solid stimulation

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
is when we stimulate everyone.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
All our clients,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
all our buyers.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
For example,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
if you buy something

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
this week,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
you will get a discount.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Selective stimulation

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
is when we stimulate

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
not everyone.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
For example, every 10th client will get a discount.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Or a competition.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Several people win in the competition.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
This is also a selective method.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
What are the main differences?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Selective stimulation gives a very good optimization

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
of expenses and budget.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You don't need to stimulate everyone

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
to optimize your expenses.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In the absence of money

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
this strategy

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
is very beneficial

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and interesting.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It allows you to maintain

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
the interest in the product

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
and does not make you spend a lot of money.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Then you will follow the algorithm

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
and follow the arrows.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Everything is clear there.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
As a result,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
you will have a choice

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
not of 15 methods of stimulation

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
but of 3-4.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
According to the budget

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
you can choose one method

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and move on.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Develop the mechanics

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and develop the stimulation program.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
What are the main tools?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I would like to talk to you

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
and focus on the most effective

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
from a practical point of view.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Of course,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
discounts for volume

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
are the most popular among our intermediaries.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Because discounts

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
allow them to earn money.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
The main goal of intermediaries

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
is to earn money,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
not to sell or promote a new product

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
to the market.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Earning money is their main goal.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Discount allows them to do it.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Therefore, discount is the most popular

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and the most basic method.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Another method

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
that concerns finances

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
is the payment delay or payment conditions.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Each company has different conditions.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Even on each market

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
there is a different payment practice.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
However, by giving a payment delay

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
you can credit the client

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
which is also a financial method

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
of stimulating sales.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Because you need to invest

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
money now or a little later.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
For each company

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
it is an important point.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
As in the case of the credit system.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Bonus for the implementation

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
of the established plan.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I would like to say

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
that bonuses work well.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
The only thing is that you need to make a clear and feasible plan.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
If you make an unfulfilled plan,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
your bonuses will not work.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Yes, you will save money

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
and you will not pay bonuses.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But the plan will not be fulfilled.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
You will not achieve the results you want.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The next method

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is a competition between companies.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
A very good method.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It works great.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It costs a little.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But the only thing you need

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
is a clear report

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
which company has fulfilled what indicators.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And moreover,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
they all need to see

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
who is in what place.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Periodically you need to send this information to them.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
To have a reason

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
for stimulation.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Not just every company

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
was cooking in its own pot,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
but saw what the other one was doing.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Then they will have a reason

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
to strive higher, further and do more.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
By participating in this competition.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
This is the main point

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
that you should not forget.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
The next method

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
is to provide a free product.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I have already said that

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
it is a very good method of stimulation.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Especially when you bring a new product to the market.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Because it works great.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And we will repeat

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
that it is loyalty,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
the ability to sell

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and the ability to give a gift.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Therefore,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
if you practice this method,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
it works very well.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Two more methods

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
that we will discuss.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The first is the payment of shelves

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
to the retail.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
If you work with retail companies,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
you provide funds to your intermediary

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
to pay for shelves in the retail.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Helping him to develop

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
his business

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and sell your product.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
This is a very good method

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
of stimulation.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
But there is a subtlety.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
You need to have a strict control.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
You need to have a strict control

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
of the shelf production

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and strict control of payment.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The recommendation is

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
to sign a three-way contract

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
between the retail and the distributor.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So that the retail

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
understands where the money comes from.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And the money should come from you.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Because you pay for the presentation

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
of your product on the shelves of the stores.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And another method

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
is the training of presentations.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The truth is that now the situation is such

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
that many intermediaries refuse to train.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
They say,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
we have a lot of suppliers

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and everyone wants to learn,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
everyone wants to do something.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
What to do in this situation?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
After all, it is necessary to inform about the product.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And if the retailers do not know anything

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
about your product,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
they will not be able to sell it normally.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The way out is as follows.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Conduct training

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
and call it not training on your product,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
but training

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
on the basis of the sales method

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
using our product as an example.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Or training

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
on the basis of merchandising

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
using our product as an example.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
This will be correct, this will be good.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
You will not only teach,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
but you will also show it

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
on your examples.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And actually you will be allowed

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to the managers of sales

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
who sell your product.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
These are the basic methods

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
of stimulating intermediaries.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
We have already discussed the pros and cons.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
And I would like to add

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
to the discounts,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
because they are the most popular.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You have a very large list of discounts

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in your educational materials.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I have collected them

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
from different companies.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Maybe you will add it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
to those that were not discounted.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But nevertheless,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
pay attention.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What can you do?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You can select those

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
discounts that are already

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
practiced in your company,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and those that are not practiced

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
are your potential.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
You can apply them from time to time.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Remember we said

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
that in order for a company not to get used to discounts,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
you need to constantly change the conditions.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Then your intermediaries

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
will not know

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
what you will come up with tomorrow.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And they will not expect

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
the next discount, the next bonus,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
and so on.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I recommend you to familiarize yourself

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
with this list

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and apply

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
certain things that are very useful

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and very effective

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
when selling products.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I would like to talk

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
about a few more points

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
in the framework of working with intermediaries.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
There are two methods

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
that help us establish

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
a closer relationship with intermediaries.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
The first one is called

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
rebate.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
In Russian,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
if you look at the essence of this method,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
you can say that it is a retro bonus

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
that is often not used by the company.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
What is the meaning of it?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It is a return on investment

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
for buying a product.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
A rebate program is a return

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
on investment

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
for a certain amount of money.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
For example, you say that your product costs

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
1,000 rubles, but if you buy

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
a batch of 1,000 pieces,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
we will give you a 15% discount.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That is, we will return 150 rubles

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
from each product.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But this will only happen if you buy

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
a certain amount.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
The client says, yes, I will buy it,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but I am not ready to do it right away

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
because it is immediate investment.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
He says, I will do it

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
within three months or a year.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But if you give him a discount in advance,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
where is the guarantee

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
that he will buy it from you?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes, he signed the contract,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
yes, he promised you,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
he will definitely do it.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
In the end, he will tell you, well, he could not.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
What will you do with it?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Such a rebate discount or retro bonus

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
is a guarantee that

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
he will either buy

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
this turnover

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
or you will not pay him

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
extra money.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And this discount that you will have to pay him

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
will work for you for a whole year.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
That is, it will be money in the turnover of your company.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
This is also a plus.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And, in fact, at the end of the period

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
when the client buys the entire batch

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
that he promised,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
you return this amount to him

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
without cash,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
which you promised,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
150 rubles from each product.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And this is either a retro bonus or a rebate program,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
whatever you call it.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
What is interesting,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
in Russia this is mainly used on the trade channel,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and in the West,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
such a system is very actively used

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
by retail stores, retail networks.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
For example,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you buy some product,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and you get a part of the amount on your card.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
This amount as money

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
is on this card.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You can return to this store and buy something

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
in the same store,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
but you cannot take it with money.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Thus, you are forced to return to this store

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
one way or another,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
become a more loyal,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
constant client to it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The next point I would like to talk about

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
is the so-called MDF funds.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Market Development Fund.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
What are these funds?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You agree with your intermediaries

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
literally on the following.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
If they buy a certain product

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
in a certain amount,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
you give them an additional discount.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
But you do not give them a discount with money.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
You accumulate this discount

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
on your account.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
A virtual account is created

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
at the client and accumulated.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
The sales manager must follow this account.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Why?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Because the sales manager

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
must follow the sales manager.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
What will this money be used for?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
To promote the product

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
on the client's territory.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
What usually happens?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Our intermediaries do not have money

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
to promote our product.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
They are not very interested in this.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They say, promote yourself if you need to.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And we are interested in promoting the product.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So, we offer an additional discount,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
accumulate the amount.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
If this amount is accumulated,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
then the intermediary can use it

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
as a marketing budget

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
to promote our product

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
on their market.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
He promotes not only our product,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
but also his company.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Therefore, in any case,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
he should be interested.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
According to the rules,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
you should say that you do not pay for this with money.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And one more condition that can be made.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
If a client develops

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
or comes up with a very interesting idea

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
or a good program,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
you can add your funds

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
to this fund

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
so that there is enough money for the implementation of this program.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I will give an example.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
In June, I participated in a conference

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
held by furniture companies.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Companies for the production of office furniture.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
One of the companies

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
is practicing

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
the creation of such funds.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
They introduced this practice

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
two years ago

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
and summed up the first results.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
There was a very interesting example.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
A company for the production of office chairs.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It has distributors.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
One of the distributors

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
also accumulated such a fund

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and decided to make a program

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
to promote expensive office chairs.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
They came up with a very interesting

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and unusual idea.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Usually, a test drive is held

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
for cars.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So, this test drive

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
was proposed to be held for chairs.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Can you imagine?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
There was a screen on the Internet

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
on Yandex

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
when a young person

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
sits in a chair

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and rides on it.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
There is an inscription

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Test Drive Chair.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
What did they propose?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They proposed to order a chair

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and try to sit on it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
They brought a chair and left it for three days.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Of course, most often expensive chairs

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
are ordered by the management.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The company's manager,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
having sat in a good chair,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
felt its convenience,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and offered money to buy this chair.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You know, the program worked

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
absolutely great.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Firstly,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
of all the chairs

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they offered

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
for a test drive

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
for several days,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
almost 70% ended up being sold.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The result was amazing.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
This program was paid

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
by such an MDF fund.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
The company itself

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
did not have enough money

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
to pay for the chair.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The head company, the manufacturer,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
added money because the idea

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
was very interesting

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
and got a good response.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Then it was copied by other companies.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
This is an example.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I recommend such funds to be created,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
but to discuss the conditions on the shore.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Dear colleagues,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I would like to discuss

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
one more point.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
It is the development of relations

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
with key clients

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Loyalty program is a talk of tongues now.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Many people talk about it,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
but unfortunately, not many do.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Why do we need it?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Our clients are not only

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
our buyers.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
In fact, they are business partners.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
They help us to do our business.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
We help them to earn money.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Why not become partners?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
When a company

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
feels like a partner,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
there is less risk

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
of losing a client,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and less chance

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
of losing a partner.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
That is why

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Loyalty programs are so popular

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
now.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I want to give you an example

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
of a developed loyalty program

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
that we developed

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and implemented

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
within the framework of our company.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
The company operates

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
on the elite alcohol market,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
but it does not matter.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
In fact, in this program

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
you can find all the necessary

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
information and materials.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You can take the main sections

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and customize the content

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
according to your company.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You can leave the main sections

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
as they are.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Each of them is important

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
for working with key clients.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I will comment on the loyalty program

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
that we developed.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The first part of the loyalty program

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
is financial support.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
We should not forget

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
that intermediaries

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
earn money.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Financial support is the first thing

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
they should pay attention to.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
What do we offer them?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
We offer an exclusive system of discounts

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
for each client.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
For example,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
if a delivery is very expensive

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and a partner in Krasnoyarsk region

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
needs to deliver goods

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
to the regions

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
with rare periods of navigation,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
it is an additional expense.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
If we can help

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
we create an exclusive program

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
and offer

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
discounts.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
The second part is payment

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
for access to the network.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
We understand that

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
if we need to enter a network store,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
there is an entrance ticket.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Our company offers

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
access to the network

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
of products

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
provided

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
that it will be

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
agreed upon.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The third part

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
is financial support.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
We offer advertising support

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
for various programs.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
If a part of the funds

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
is paid by the intermediary,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
if you do everything

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
for the intermediary,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
it will not be a loyalty program,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
but a permanent sponsorship.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
The intermediary should feel

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
himself as an active part

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and be responsible for the result

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
and should contribute

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
to the promotion.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Another part

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
of financial support

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
is the purchase of additional equipment,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
such as cabinets,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
refrigerators,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and display cases.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
This equipment

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
can be included

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
as part of the payment

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
for access to the trading points

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
or instead of it.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Here you can

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
consider different options.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
This is all

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
about financial support.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The next part

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
is information support.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Information is not

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
what we need

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
when making management decisions.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
We gather information,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
of course.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
We have analysts

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
who constantly gather information

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
about the market,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
the information from the industry press,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
we conduct various researches,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
evaluate competitors,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
consider the dynamics of the market,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
we do a lot of work.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Why can't we

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
share this information

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
with our key partners?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Of course, we can do it.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
We do it anyway

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
and the additional service

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
will be free for us.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
We offer

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
a selection of this information

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
and its distribution

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
so that they can

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
make their management decisions

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
in our market.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The next part

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
of the loyalty program

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
is advertising materials.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Advertising materials

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
are catalogues, leaflets,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
souvenir products,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
encyclopedias of drinks

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
that we made

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
in a multimedia version.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Everything that helps

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
to present our product

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
to our clients.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
What I would like to say here is that

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
if you pay for catalogues

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
and send them to your clients,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
think about

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
how to spend

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
your money more effectively.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
For example,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
you can embed information

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
into the catalog of your client.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I will explain why.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Imagine that a sales representative

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
goes to a sales point

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
to offer your product

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
to your client.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
He has a big portfolio

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
with documents,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
his own catalog of the company,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and he has 15 more companies

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
that he sells

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and he has to carry all catalogues.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Most often he just throws them away.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
He does not carry them with him.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
If he does not offer them,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
your product is not sold.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That's it.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
When you pay

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
for individual leaflets

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
of your client

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and place your product there,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
be sure that he will

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
take this catalog with him

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and offer it.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
At least, your client will see your product

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and there will be a reason

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
to order it.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
The next part of the loyalty program

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
is the offer of help from our specialists.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
What do I mean?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I mean consulting,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
that is, training in goods,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
training in logistics,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
for example, the implementation of business processes

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
that we have already implemented in our company,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
we help to implement in the company of competitors.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We have already gone this way,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
we have seen mistakes,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
we have seen additional subtleties,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
points that need to be taken into account.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
We can share our experience

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
with our colleagues

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
and build the right business processes

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
in their business.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
This helps a lot and makes the business

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
more profitable, more optimal.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Therefore, as a program,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
it is recommended to offer

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
such services.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
The next block is joint shares

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
and joint projects.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
What can be offered here?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
When we feel like partners,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
when we have some kind of joint activity

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
within the framework of these joint projects,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
we have developed a trading brand

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
in which several participants,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
several key clients were invested.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
We developed it together,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
we promoted it together to the market.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
This united us as a group of companies

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
that bring this product to the market.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
This made us partners

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and does not allow it to fall apart

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
under certain circumstances.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Next, it is joint participation

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
in exhibitions,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
joint participation in sponsorship projects.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Maybe even on the client's territory,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
when you yourself

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
offer him participation

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
in this sponsorship project,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
provided that, of course,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
the intermediary company

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
also participates there independently.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Also, as a joint share,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
you can offer a product presentation

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
for partner clients.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
That is, your people

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
go to the intermediary's territory,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
where a certain number of clients

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
are gathered

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and a presentation is held.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You can hold such presentations

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
with the participation of suppliers

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
whom you attract

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
to this activity,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
which greatly increases

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
the image of the company in the eyes of the client

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and helps him to sell it,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
which is also very important.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The next point is the training

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
that we can offer.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
We offer a list of trainings

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that we can hold at the client's company.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Naturally, we do not ask

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
for any payment for this.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
This is within the framework of the loyalty program.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
The next section is

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
demo equipment.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
What can we offer them

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
as part of the demonstration?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
These are free samples of the product,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
various miniatures,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
that is, a product in a minimal version.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
This is a souvenir product.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
This is the same encyclopedia of drinks

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
that I told you about.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
That is, a catalog of products

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
in a multimedia version.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Everything that will help them

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
make the presentation of your product

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
more comfortable,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
more popular.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
And two more points,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
two sections that we included.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
This is Internet support.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
We told our partners,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
told them about the companies

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
we work with,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
reflected the results of various competitions,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
various promotions.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
The profile of our partner

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
was always posted on our website.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
This is additional advertising.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And one more point,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
which was also recorded in the loyalty program,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
is various competitions.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Funny, funny,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
but helping to unite

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
in the interests of the company.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
This is a competition for the best showroom,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
a competition for the best joke.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
We had a competition

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
for the best secretary of the referent.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
We called companies

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and evaluated

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
how they meet the client,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
how they talk to him.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
A lot of employees participated.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
This is a competition for a children's drawing,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
which, in general,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
probably dates back to Soviet times,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
but does not lose its relevance,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
despite the vision of the world

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
through the eyes of children.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
This unites us,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
because it gives us

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
a positive charge of emotions.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
We also posted

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
very interesting promotions,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
which were held in certain companies,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and even not in our industry,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
as a source of ideas,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
so that you could see

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
where and what could be done,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
what to look up, what to adopt,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
what experience to use.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
We offered this not only to key clients,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but also to selected clients.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This is a very important point,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
because the company does not have enough resources

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
to provide such a list of services

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
to each client.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Moreover, an exclusive client

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
should feel his exclusivity.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
By offering such a program,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
you let him feel it.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
You make it

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
your partner,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
your friend,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and, therefore,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
you allow the client

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
to leave you for another

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
competitor, for another company.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I also want to offer you

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
a table in your lecture material,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
where you will find

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
a rating of various promotions

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
on incentives.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
There are percentages,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
how many percent

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the sales volume increases.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Some promotions have a very long

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
period of time, a very long

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
run in figures,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
because I collected statistics

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
from different industries,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
from different sources,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
from different markets.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Therefore, there is a minimum and a maximum,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
which I personally observed.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Maybe you will correct this table

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
according to your database

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and you will have a ready-made database

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
inside the company,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
where you will note

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
how much and how much

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
your sales have grown

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
during a certain promotion.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I would like to say a few words

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
about merchandising, literally a couple.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
In your lecture materials

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
there will be a more detailed

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
material on merchandising,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
the development of the

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
merchandising standard

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
for the company will be considered,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
which is very important

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
if your product is presented on the shelves.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
We will talk about the main points.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I would like to focus on the fact

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that merchandising is

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
selling art,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and in general it is a competent,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
clear and correct spread

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
according to all the main rules

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
of merchandising.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Such a spread allows

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
to increase the turnover,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
as I said, from 80 to 300%.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
But before moving

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
to the rules themselves,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I would like to focus on the goals,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
because the goals are the first thing

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
that we determine.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I would like to focus on the goals

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
of merchandising manufacturers

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and the goals of merchandising sellers,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
that is, the selling point.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I would like to emphasize your attention

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
that these are different goals

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
and you must take into account

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
the goals of the selling point

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
when you come to it

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
and offer your standard.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
You need to understand what they want.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Let's see.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
The goals of the manufacturer.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Of course, increasing the turnover

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
and volume of sales of your own product.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
If you pay attention

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
to the goals of the seller,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
then there is an increase

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
in the turnover of the store in general.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It does not matter to him

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
whether your product is increasing

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
or someone else's,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
the main thing for him is

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
that the turnover of the store

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
becomes larger.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The next goal of the manufacturer

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
is to attract attention

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
to his own assortment,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
to his own trademark.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And this is understandable

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
because the seller says

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
that it is important for him

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
to optimize the assortment of the store in general,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
because the store provides a service

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
for selecting an assortment,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
and not the only product

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
that the buyer needs to present.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
The main thing is that the buyer

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
came and found everything he needs

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
in this selling point.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Therefore, he will not pay

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
much attention to your product.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
The next goal of the manufacturer

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
is to create a competitive advantage of the product.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
What do we see in the seller?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Of course, the creation of a competitive advantage

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
of the store.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
For example, there is a wider assortment,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
or there are lower prices,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
or there is a very convenient parking,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
or there is a complex with a store,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
a cafe and an entertainment center.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
That is, the seller needs

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
a competitive advantage of the store in general,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
and we need

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
a competitive advantage of our product.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Here our goals do not coincide.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
The next point is

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
to create an attachment to the trading mark,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
says the manufacturer,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
to our trading mark.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
What does the seller say?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
He just needs an optimal assortment

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
of well-known brands

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
that will be visited by certain buyers.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
He does not care about

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
an attachment to a particular brand,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
he cares about an attachment

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
to a package of well-known brands.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
The next goal of the manufacturer

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
is, of course, to avoid a situation

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
when the product is not in the trading point.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Because when your product is not there,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
the buyer just switches

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
to another trading mark.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
For the store, of course, it is also important

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
that the full assortment is present,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
but if there is no your product,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
then they will put another one.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
In general, there will be no problems.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Therefore, here you yourself must make sure

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
that your product is present in the trading point.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Well, the next one is to form an attachment

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
to the positive image of the manufacturer.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Says the manufacturer,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
it is important for me to be well perceived.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
And what does the store say?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The store says that it is important

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
for the store to be perceived in general,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
positively,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
so that there are flexible conditions,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
for example, in terms of working time,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
for example, up to the last buyer,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
or something like that.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
That is, the store is naturally important

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
in general,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and our trading mark is important to us.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
And these things need to be taken into account

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
when we develop the standard of merchandising

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
and offer our product

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
to the trading point.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Let's consider the main tasks

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
of the company's merchandising.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
What should you pay attention to

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
when you develop a standard

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
or when you determine the product schedule?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
What should you take into account?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
The first is the minimum set

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
of assortment positions,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
or they also call it SKU.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Roughly speaking, one unit of the assortment.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
That is, how many of you

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
should have the layout of this assortment

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
so that your layout

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
looks high-quality and good.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
The next task

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
is the place where your product is placed.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
You must determine the category

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
in which department your product is placed

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and in which place of the store.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
The next task

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
is the number of additional sales places.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
This is very important

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
because additional sales places

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
give the opportunity

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
for additional acquaintance with your product.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
And, of course,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
your most popular product is placed there,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
which greatly increases sales.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
You must determine in advance

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
where it is possible to place additional places.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Next, you must determine

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
the number of SKU,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
how many assortment units

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
of the product are placed

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
and the order of their placement.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
For example, from light to dark,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
from the lowest price to the highest,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
from the lowest fat to the highest,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and so on.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That is, the order can be different

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
depending on the product,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
if the product is placed from light to dark,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
or a combination of colors,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
or a joint purchase.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
That is, the rules can be different,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
there are a lot of them,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
but you must immediately

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
determine by standards

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
what rules you set this product.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The next point is the number of positions

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
or they also call it facing.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Look, an assortment is an assortment unit.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
For example, you decided

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
that you will put

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
three office chairs,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
but these three office chairs

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
can be repeated, right?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And SKU will be three,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
because there are three different types.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And facing is how many chairs there will be.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Roughly speaking,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
if you put each SKU in two positions,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
then the facing will be equal to six.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
The next thing to determine

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
is the product supply

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
or the minimum load.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
The product supply should be

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
such that it is constantly present

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
on the shelf of the store,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
taking into account that it leaves

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
this shelf.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That is, a certain supply

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
should always be in the store.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The next point is positioning

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
the price relative to the competitors.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That is, you must immediately determine

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
what price category your product is in,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
because different price categories

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
are distributed differently,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and actually where this product

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
will be located,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
next to which competitors,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and what is the recommended price

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
for this product, it is different.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Therefore, we must clearly determine

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
what the price will be for us.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
The next point, which is often determined

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
by very famous manufacturers,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
is the share relative to the competitors

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
of your product.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
For example, you say that the share

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
of our office chairs should be 50%

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
relative to competitors,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
that is, half of the category should be

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
occupied by us.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
This is, of course, an ambitious goal,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
but nevertheless, such goals are set

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and there are two more points

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
that we must talk about.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
This is, of course, the placement of price tags.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
A clear and competent design

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and where they are placed.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
In some stores there are standards

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
for price tags, and this is great,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
but in some stores they simply

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
do not comply, so where and how

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
we place them must be necessarily

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
agreed upon in the standard of merchandising.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And the last point is the schedule itself.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That is, we must draw out how,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
where and why our product is,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
so that the merchandiser does not invent

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and do not compose and do not fantasize

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
how to put it,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
how it will be better, how it will be worse.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
We must give him a clear instruction

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
so that he does not touch it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Only this will ensure you

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
increased sales and efficiency

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
of this tool.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
All the basic rules of merchandising

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
will be described in your lecture material,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
which will help you to form

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
the right schedule

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and the standard of merchandising.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
There are three groups of these rules.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
This is the location, presentation

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and stock.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You can decode all of them there,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
look at them,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
determine the rules of the layout

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
and, in fact,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
create your own standard of merchandising

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
according to the image and likeness.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And about the location itself,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I would like to say a few more words

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and show you the hot and cold

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
zones in the store

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to understand where you can

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
put the products and where not.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Here is the image.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
You can see that

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
all 100% of the products

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
that enter the store

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
only 90% of them

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
are in the first square.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The rest 10% take what they need

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and go to the checkout or return

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
after leaving the store.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Then, during the movement,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
only 70% pass.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The rest 20% have already taken

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
the product and went to the checkout.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Only 50% pass.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And at the end of the store,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that is, the entire cycle of the store

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
only 30%.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You see how the number of buyers

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
that pass the whole hall decreases.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
This, of course, reduces

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
the efficiency of sales.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And that square where the buyer

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
is only 30% is the lower left square.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It is considered the most

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
ineffective, it is considered

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
the cold zone of the store.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
If your product is located in this zone,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
then you will not be surprised

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
why your sales are so small.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
How to avoid this?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
You can highlight something bright,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
you can put large figures,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
additional lighting,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
any bright things that will attract

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
the attention of the buyer

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and make them go further.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Remember the location of supermarkets.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
In this department, most often,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
there is bread and, moreover, it is baked there.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The smell, the aroma of bread

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
makes us go there

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
like Pavlov's dog.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It makes us go through

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
most of the store.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That is why departments are placed

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
in this way.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Also, on the slide you have

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the rules of the golden triangle.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
The location of the golden triangle

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
consists of three parts.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
The first is the entrance,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
the second point is the cash desk

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and the third point is the department

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
that is most often visited by

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
the buyer.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It is a department of milk and meat.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Daily products are sold there

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
that the buyer

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
has come for.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
If you are a manufacturer,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
your task is to get into

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the zone of the golden triangle

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
because when you get into

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
the zone, your sales

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
increase by at least 80%.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Most often, the buyers

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
pass there.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And the task of the store itself

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
is to make the most popular

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
departments, cash desk and entrance

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
at a distance.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Thus, it expands the field

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
of active activity of the buyers

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and the zone of active purchases.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Well,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
let's move on to the stimulation

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
of end users.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Not all companies

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
are engaged in this.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Nevertheless,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
it is an expensive process,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
but it is very necessary

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
because the client can leave us

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
to other intermediaries

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
if our discount does not suit him.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And end users are more loyal.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
If they liked our products,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
they will return to us

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and buy from us

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
and provide us with

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
this or that income.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So, when we stimulate

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
end users,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
the main goal is, of course,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
to increase the volume of sales.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But you can increase the volume of sales

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
according to the scheme.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
At least,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
the increase of sales

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
is divided into two parts

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
– loyalty and trial purchases.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Trial purchases are more

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
related to the new product,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and loyalty is related to the existing product,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
to the maintenance of the reliability

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and loyalty of our product.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
These two groups are divided

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
into goals.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Additionally, trial purchases

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
are divided into two parts –

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
the availability of the product,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
that is, the person should want to buy it,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
and availability,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
he should find a place where it is sold.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And loyalty is divided into three parts –

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the frequency of purchase,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
how often they buy,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
adherence,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
do they buy our brand all the time,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and the possibility

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
or frequency of switching

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
from the brand of competitors

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
to our brand.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
All these five goals

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
are described in the lecture material.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Each of the possible goals

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
is described in more detail

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
when designing

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
and developing

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
the incentive program

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
for end users.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
We will see

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
how to plan

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
these actions correctly.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Planning consists

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
of three main steps.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The first is to determine

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
the target audience.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
We need to understand

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
who we are targeting,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
who are its participants.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
There are several criteria

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
that help the target audience

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
to determine the end users.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The three main groups

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
are regional criteria,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
the lifestyle of consumers,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and demographic criteria.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
In terms of frequency of use,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I can tell you

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that demographic criteria

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
are most often used –

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
gender,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
education level.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The second place

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
is for regional criteria,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
location, climate.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It is very important

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
for some products.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
The third place

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
is for the lifestyle of consumers.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
These criteria are more sociological,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
that's why they are used less often.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
To determine

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
the target audience,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
we need specialists,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
psychologists,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and other experts.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
When we determined the target audience,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
we described it.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
For example,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
the target audience

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
of polyvitamins

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is women

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
between 25 and 45 years old,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
who have a family,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
at least one child,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
who work,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
who have

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
a higher level

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
of higher or middle

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
special education,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
who live

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
in cities

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
with a population

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
of at least 200,000 people.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Here is a segmentation

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
of vitamins consumption.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Of course,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
all other categories,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
women or men,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
can also consume vitamins,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
but we, remember,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
select the target audience,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
who buy the most.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Here is the target audience.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
The clearer your segmentation,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
the more competently you will develop

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the promotion program.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Remember, skeletons

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
are yogurts aimed

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
at the group of teenagers

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
between 12 and 14 years old.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The positioning was very clear.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It was this

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that gave such success to this product.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yes, parents did not like

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
this product, because

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
it was ridiculous and funny,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
or maybe it was unpleasant for someone,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
but the skeleton

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
achieved its target audience,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and their sales were just amazing.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Therefore,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
here is very important,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
that is, the target audience

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
is the determining factor of success.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The second step we take

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
is the time of holding.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
We determine how long

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the promotion will take.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It can be a long-term promotion,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
or a seasonal promotion,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
or regular events,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
or periodic events.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
What does it mean?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It can be a holiday event,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and we determine

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
whether it is short-term,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
medium-term,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and long-term.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It can be more than one year.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I will say that short-term events

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
are more effective than long-term.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Why?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
When we hold a promotion program

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and stimulate it,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
the effect is fast.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Sales go up quickly,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and we see the result right away,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
because we make our customers

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
or consumers act immediately.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
The duration of the action

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
is limited by the program.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And when the program is long-term,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
there is such a postponement effect.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
The program is still going on for a long time.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I will come later, I will do it later,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I will buy it later,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
while I have this, while I have that.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
The program is not in peak form.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
It is slightly increasing,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and it is at this level.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
You get the feeling

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
that you spend a lot,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
but you do not have the effect.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Therefore,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
short-term promotions

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
work more effectively

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
and more purposefully

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
for end consumers.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
The third point

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
that we must determine

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
is the budget restrictions.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The budget is offered in different ways,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
developed in different ways.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Here are the main methods

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
of budgeting.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The first is the percentage of sales.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
When we say that we have a sales volume

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and such a percentage,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
for example, 3 or 5%,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
we can take it on a stimulus program.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Yes, this is an option,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
because it depends on the turnover,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
it is tied clearly,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and we will not spend more than necessary.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The second option is possible.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
You can take from the turnover,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and you take from the additional turnover.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
How much you earn in addition,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
or rather from the profit.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
This is also a correct option,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
because it is important for the owner

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
how much additional money he will receive,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and not just stimulate

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
his end consumers.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
The next point is planning for goals.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
When you set goals,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
determine the share that you need,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and then form a budget,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and then approve this budget.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Planning for goals is the most correct

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
option for planning,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
but of course you need to calculate

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
and not go into losses.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
If we planned for goals

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
that we need to spend certain amounts,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
it does not mean

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that the company should work in losses.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
The marketer should count

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
both sides of the coin,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
both the side of spending and the side of income.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Otherwise, the stock will not be effective,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
and therefore it will not be a stimulus stock.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The next two points

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
that can be taken into account

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
are the comparison with the industry costs.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You know approximately

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
how much is spent on advertising.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
For example,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
the company spends $ 2 million

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
on advertising of washing powder.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And you, of course,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
based on this,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
understand that if you spend $ 1.5 million,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
then there will be no effect.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
If you spend $ 2.5 million,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
there will probably be a greater effect.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
But $ 2.5 million is an average amount

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
that you need to spend

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
to ensure such fame.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That is,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
average costs of advertising are compared.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
They are in the sources of information

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
in the journal Praktika.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Advertising is constantly published there.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The next point

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
that can be taken into account

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
is the comparison with competitors.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Look what competitors do.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
After all, we know how much advertising costs

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
in the media, how much it costs to hold

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
promotions, how much it costs to develop a video,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and so on.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We know all these estimates.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Seeing what competitors do,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
you can safely calculate

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
how much they spend.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And if you position yourself next to them,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
then you can determine

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
a similar amount or a little more,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
depending on what goals you have

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
for advertising.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
There is also one method,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
the most ineffective,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
for residual funds.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Usually, there are no such funds.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Therefore, this method

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
is the most ineffective

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
and does not usually give results.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I would like to draw your attention

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
to the fact that in your lecture material

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
the rules and techniques of creating ideas

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
will be voiced and marked.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
The most basic rules

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
that are used in the development of various promotions.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
These are the magic numbers

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
when we say

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
all goods for 10 rubles

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
or two for the price of one, and so on.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
The next is crisis sales.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Remember the company Zhe.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The store Zhe, which says

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
that the sale has been going on for 2-3 years

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and could not be sold.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You announce this

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
and all customers come to you

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
because they think you are closing.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Next is a gift for purchase.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This is another idea

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
that is very often emulated and used

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
because everyone likes to receive gifts.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
What else

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
would I like to draw your attention to?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
When you think about the idea of a promotion,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
pay attention to the topics

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
that are interesting to everyone.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
What topics are interesting to everyone?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Cars, sports,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
war, sex,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
children,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
animals,

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
entertainment, food.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Everything that concerns our life,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
everything that guides us in one way or another.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You can take all these topics

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
as an idea for a promotion.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Because everything that concerns

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
our life,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
everything that passes through feelings,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
through emotions,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
works very well.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You can apply various dual meanings

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
or gossips.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
For example, a discount is equal to the number of years.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Or today there will be such a discount,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
what is the number in the yard today?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Then everyone will wait

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
until the end of the month,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
because there will be a discount.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
You can apply elements

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
of the corporate style.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
For example, if a company

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
did such a promotion,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
everyone who comes in red will get a 10% discount.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
You can develop the existing concept.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
For example, you already have a discount card,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
but you continue to work with it

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and tell everyone who comes today

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
with a discount card,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
double the discount,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
not the one that is indicated on the card.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
New well-taken care of the old

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
is again a recommendation.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Make databases and look at them

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
which promotions work best for you.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I would like to offer you

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
another method.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
This is an assessment of the creative idea of ​​the promotion.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
There are the main criteria

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
on which you can recheck yourself.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Have you taken into account everything?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Have you worked out all the criteria

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
when you thought about the idea of ​​your promotion?

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It is evaluated on a 10-point scale

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
and then the final score is drawn.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
But the final score is not as important

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
as the criteria that will earn

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
the lowest points in your assessment.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
The criteria that will earn

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
the lowest points in your assessment

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
mean that they are not worked out

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and you need to do something

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
with them.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
This is a signal that the promotion

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
is not fully thought out.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
What criteria are there?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Of course,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
the compliance of the trademark.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We look at how your idea

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
complies with the trademark.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
If your product is exclusive

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and very expensive,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
then you should not start a sale.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
The idea is unique.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
It's great when you get a high score.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
But most often, ideas are repeated.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
However, if you have something interesting,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
such as an office test drive,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
this idea deserves a high score.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Try to come up with something of your own.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Or give the agency the opportunity to do it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The next criterion is the ability to implement it in practice.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You can come up with anything.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
For example, a flight to the moon.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
But how much can it be implemented?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
This is a question.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
You can come up with a lot of ideas.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
But how much can it be implemented?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
This is a question.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Therefore, the idea should be realistic.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
The relevance of the idea.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Fashion for certain things.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It is advisable to follow the fashion.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
For example, mobile marketing

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
is very relevant now.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
You can hold promotions

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
on your mobile phone,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
which work very well.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Or with the introduction of new technologies.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Effectiveness.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Your offer should be interesting to buyers.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
It should satisfy their needs.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Because if they are interested,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
no matter what the promotion is,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
they will not participate in it.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
The next two criteria are simplicity and availability.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Simplicity.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
This is how clear the conditions are.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So that you don't have this.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Go to the forest, look for the tenth stump,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
find a coupon,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
bring it to the fourth store

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
after the fifth turn, and so on.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
The more difficult the conditions of the promotion,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
the more likely

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
your promotion will not be attended.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And availability.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
How easy it is to participate in your promotion.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
It should be a shopping mall nearby.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So that a person can come,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
find where the promotion takes place,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
where the prizes are given, and so on.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
The next criteria is

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
visibility for the target audience.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It is noticeable

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and it is good when it coincides

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
with the already held

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
advertising campaigns.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It is within the general concept.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Not just one promotion,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
but within the general concept.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Then its effectiveness increases many times.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The next criteria are

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
the idea should be in line

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
with all elements of marketing

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and be attractive to the target audience.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
You also evaluate

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
on a ten-point scale.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And the reward for the participants

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
is attractive and useful.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
They need this product.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It's not just some kind of trifle

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
that a person will throw out

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
on the street.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So, you can evaluate your idea

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
and see what points

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
you need to improve.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
What should you pay attention to

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
when developing a promotion?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Of course, the development of a scenario.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
This is the main document

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
that will allow you to hold a promotion

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
without a hitch and a stump.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That is, do not forget anything

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
that is particularly important

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
for the promotion

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
to be successful and effective.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
There are six main sections

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
of a promotion.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
The first one is, of course,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
a detailed description of the mechanics.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
What do you want to get

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
from this promotion?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
How should this promotion go?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
What should your buyer do

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
to get a prize?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
What is the prize?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Where will it be issued?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
In what quantity?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
All of this must be written down.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
This is probably the most important thing

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
to do in the first place.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Because the budget of your promotion

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
will depend on this.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
The next thing to do is to choose

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
a place of holding.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Where do you hold it?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
In what trading points?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Or somewhere else?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
It is important to choose

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
a place of holding

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and decide whether

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
the trading points

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
will agree to hold this promotion

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
The next main thing

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
to consider is working with the promotion staff.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
You need to take this

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
very seriously, because the result

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
of your promotion depends on the staff.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
If you give all of this to the agency

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
for a ransom and do not

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
take part in this,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
you risk that your promotion staff

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
will not be ready for the promotion,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
will not understand what the product is,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
what the purpose of the promotion is,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
and, most importantly, what you need to achieve.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
As a result, the money spent

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
will go nowhere.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So be sure to participate

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
in the selection of the promotion staff

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and in their preparation.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
The next thing is preparation for the event.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You have already scheduled it,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
you have already recruited everyone.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Now you need to check if everything is ready.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Do the sales managers know

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
that the product needs to be brought?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Do the trading points know

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
that they are holding a promotion?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Do the promotion staff know everything?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Are there enough prizes?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
All these points must be checked

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
and calculated.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And once again,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I remind everyone that

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
at some point the promotion starts

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
so that everyone is ready.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
The next thing is the

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
implementation of the event.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Here I have one recommendation for you.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
We have a strict control.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
In Russia, the order to become a management

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
is a reason for reflection.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Therefore, always check

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
if everything goes well.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
If there is no control,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I assure you that there will be

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
more mistakes than enough.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Because even when the control is in place,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
this happens.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
But there you can at least

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
react quickly.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
If you do not control,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
the results of the promotion will be depressing,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and you will not be able to fix anything.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Therefore, be sure to control

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and correct the situation

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
during the promotion.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And the next point is

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
the action after the promotion.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
That is, the analysis of efficiency.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Here you must calculate

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
whether you spent money in vain,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
whether you did everything right,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
what were the calculations or problems.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
In the lecture material,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
you will have an example of a promotion report

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
that you can use in your work.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
What mistakes are most often

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
when holding a promotion?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I counted 17 of them.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Maybe you will add something to my list.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
What happened

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
in practice?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
The first mistake is the lack of planning.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
When a sales manager comes to us

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and says,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
urgently, I am being taken out of the store,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
let's do some promotion quickly.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
That is, it was necessary to do everything yesterday.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
A hurry begins.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
We start doing something without planning.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
This is a strategy of

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
locking holes, which we have already talked about today.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And as a result, the promotion

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
turns out so-so.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
That is, something, of course, comes out.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
We have a lot of managers with time and resources.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But it could have turned out much better

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
if everything was according to plan.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Therefore, do not take literally

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
the words of managers.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Work according to your plan.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Only then will there be order.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The next point is poor staff preparation.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
This is what I was talking about.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
They did not control,

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
let's say,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
the information of the staff.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
That is, not everyone knows about the promotion.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Who needs to know this?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Moreover, the promotional staff

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
cannot link two words about your product,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
which is completely unacceptable.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Theft.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
In general, theft, of course,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
is probably a common problem in Russia.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I don't know.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Promoters, of course,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
even exchange prizes.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Sometimes, when several promotions are held in the trading point,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
they start exchanging prizes.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
This is not their hobby.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Naturally, you cannot prevent

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
100% theft of your souvenirs,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
prizes, gifts, and so on.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
But by giving a decent payment to the promoter

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
and putting the case under clear control,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
that is, registration of all the gifts,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
you at least reduce this percentage.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I do not enjoy illusions

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
that you can completely eradicate this problem.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But at least reduce the losses.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
This is also useful.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
The next is the appearance of the promoters.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
What usually happens?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Usually, t-shirts, caps of corporate color

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and that's it.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
They are all in the same color.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
That's all.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
We stop at this.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Because the appearance of the promoter is very important.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Not only that,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
in ordinary t-shirts and caps

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
he is not highlighted from the crowd,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
he is simply not seen

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
and does not participate in the promotion.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Secondly,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
when saving money,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
we simply shift

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
the positioning of our product.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
We do not highlight it,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
we do not show all its pros and cons.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
The appearance of the promoters is especially important.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And the suit,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and his own hairstyle,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and his manner of keeping himself.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
This is all very important.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Therefore, pay attention to this.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
There were cases when

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
there was an ad

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
for elite alcohol.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And there the girls were in gorgeous dresses,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
of a wonderful look,

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
but they saved on hairstyles

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and the image was violated.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Therefore,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
if you invest money,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
invest it all,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
so that the integrity of the image is not violated.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Then the effect will be completely different

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
from your promotion.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
The next point is the lack of a connecting idea.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And this is just a problem of looting holes.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
We act not within the framework

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
of the general marketing program,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
but we act simply by the method of a push.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
The problem has arisen,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
it must be solved.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
The problem has arisen, we solve it again.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But the connecting idea does not work.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Therefore, everyone is responsible for the promotion.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And if everything was according to plan,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
everything was interconnected,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
the synergy would be much higher.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
The next mistake in determining the target audience.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
We have already talked about this in advertising.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Here, the same thing.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
We have wrongly determined the target audience.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
We did not get it easily

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and did not get such an effect.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
The lack of clear reports.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
This is also one of the disadvantages.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And the company itself is to blame for this.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
The company itself must think through the reporting system.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
After all, it needs efficiency.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We spend money, not someone else.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Therefore, it is in our interests

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
to make a reporting system

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and to follow it clearly

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
so that all the reporting is filled.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Then we can calculate the effectiveness of the promotion.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Poor organization of regional promotions.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Probably, this is a common problem.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Because we cannot control,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
we cannot track.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Recommendations should be given to agency payments.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Networks that have

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
a head office in central cities

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and their branches

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
in different cities of the Russian Federation.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
At least they have gained experience

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
in holding such promotions.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And they will do it more professionally

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
than the manager in the places.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And it is not even clear

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
whether these managers are there or not.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Therefore, it is better to trust professionals.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Mistake in setting the target of the promotion companies.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
We say that we need to introduce a new product.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
We leave the goal of increasing the volume of sales.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
This is a mistake.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
When we introduce a new product,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
it is a familiarization with the product.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
The goal was set incorrectly,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
the mechanics were thought out incorrectly.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
As a result, the promotion did not work.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
That's all.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Next.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Insufficient allocation of funds for holding promotions.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
We regret money.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
We say, let's save it,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
here we will cut, there we will cut.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
As a result, the cut promotion is worth nothing.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
A clear opinion has formed.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
If you need to hold something,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
do it as it should be.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Better.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
If you want to save,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
it is better not to do it at all.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
At least the money will remain.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And so you will spend money,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
and you will not achieve the result.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The lack of standard documentation.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It intersects a little with the accounting system.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
The lack of standard documentation

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
implies additional costs for you.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
If you had standard accounting,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
you would have spent

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
every penny

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
for the documentation.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
If you do not have it,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
you have to think about

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
spending your resources

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
to make this documentation.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
The too complicated

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
mechanics of holding promotions.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
We said that

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
you can't do complicated mechanics.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
If it is not clear, it will not work.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
The lack of centers for giving out prizes.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Many clients are offended

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that they should get a prize,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
or the prize is not given

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
in the center of the prizes.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Or you have to go very far

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
to the center of the prizes.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
This creates a negative feeling

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
for your clients.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
If you do not have the opportunity

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
to provide with prizes,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
then it is better to replace the prizes

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
or think about another action.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Because the negative is not forgotten.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
It is deposited on your product,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
even if it is very good.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
The program can fall out

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
of the general positioning of the trademark.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I gave an example.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
The reason for the disregard

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
of the goals is repeated.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
If the product is exclusive,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
do not sell it.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
This is an absolute disregard.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
There are many other examples.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
The next mistake is wrong.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
The choice of promotion channels.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
We did not ask our clients

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
where they get the information from.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
As a result,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
this information did not reach them.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
We posted the announcement

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
in one place,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and our clients walk

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
on the other road.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
The promotion did not work.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
The next mistake is the lack

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
of information about the promotion.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The consumer does not know

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
what the promotion is.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
This happens in companies

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
that hold promotions

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
for their customers.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Sales managers forget

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
to tell that the promotion is held.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
As a result,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
the first mistake is the lack of information.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
The second mistake is the lack of feedback.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Do the clients participate?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
If not, why?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
This is the last mistake.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
The third mistake is the lack

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
of goods at the trading points.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Imagine that the promotion was developed,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
the script was prepared,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
the money was paid,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
but the sales manager forgot

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
the goods at the trading points.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
The sales manager is not a sales manager.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
He is a sales manager.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
The sales manager forgot

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
the goods at the trading points.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The promotion failed.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
We should fire such managers.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
We should fire those who did not control

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
that the manager remembered

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
that the manager had a lot of work.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
He needs to sell.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
If the marketing manager is responsible

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
for the promotion,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
he should control

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
that everyone did what was necessary.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Be sure to control.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
The most offensive thing happens

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
when the promotion fails

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
because of such a reason.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
We have seen the mistakes

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
that can happen.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I want to draw your attention

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
to some promotions

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
that I have given as an example.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
The source of information

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
is btl.ru.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
There are analyses

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
of various promotions.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I would like to give

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
the most successful ones.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
The first promotion

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
is called «Do not miss the moment».

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
It was held with Sony Ericsson mobile phone.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It is called «Cameraphone».

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
The meaning of the phone

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
is that you press the button

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
and you can take 9 photos at once.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
You can take photos

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
in different ways

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and get interesting shots.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
That is why the promotion

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
is called «Do not miss the moment».

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The promotion was held in two stages.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
The first one was held

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
near the trading points

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
and the girls were taking photos

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
with the camera of the buyers

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
who came to the trading points.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Then the photos were posted

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
on the website.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
The people who took the photos

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
were offered to visit the website

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and download the photos.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
The photos were very interesting

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
and the children were interested

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
in getting on the plane.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
In general, they were allowed

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
to use the mobile phone.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
The second part of the promotion

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
was more interesting.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
In St. Petersburg and Moscow

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
8 high-rise business centers

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
were chosen.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
The girls were hired

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
as promoters.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
They wore parachutes

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
and went down the stairs

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
from the roof of the business center.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
There were 4 sides of the business center

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and each side

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
was going down the girl's way.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Imagine that you are sitting

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
on the 30th floor

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and you are a girl.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
How do you feel?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I can tell you that

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
the business centers were closed

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
that day.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
The girls were advertising

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
their mobile phones,

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
taking photos

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
of the faces of the surprised people

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
who were in the business centers.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
In general,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
this company was a sensation.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It cost a lot of money.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
It cost 80,000 dollars.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I want to say that

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
it was also given

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
a special license

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
because it was impossible

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
not to write about it.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
In addition,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
the mobile phones

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
were sold in the business centers.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
The promotion was very interesting

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
and unusual in its own way.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
The next promotion

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
was held in Nizhny Novgorod

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
called Autofotomoyka.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It was organized by Tele2,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
a mobile operator.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
They wanted to expand

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
their presence in the market.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Everyone who came to the gas station

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
was offered

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
to buy a SIM card

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
of Tele2.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
The SIM card cost 100 rubles.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
When the check was issued,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
two girls of a fairly

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
sexual appearance

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
washed the windshield

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
for free of the person

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
who bought the card.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I want to say that

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
such a promotion was in great demand.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Everyone was very interested.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
In 5 days,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
more than 2,000 customers

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
used this service.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
The question is

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
who stayed with this operator.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I hope that they stayed.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
The promotion was not so expensive.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It was discussed for a long time.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It was interesting.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
This is another promotion

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
that I would like to tell you about.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
It was organized by Sveznoi.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
In Novosibirsk,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
it was called the Orange Revolution.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It was not expensive.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
It was a very small expense.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It was very interesting

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
and intriguing.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
It was held in 4 days.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
The first day

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
was in 2005.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
In the summer,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
many dogs

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
were walking on the streets

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
in orange suits.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Imagine that you go out

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and the whole city is in orange suits.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
No one understands what is going on.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Everyone starts to discuss

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
what kind of dogs are walking.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Dogs were walking in orange suits

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
for 2 days.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Then they disappeared.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
The next kind of announcement

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
appeared on the poles.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
A dog in an orange suit disappeared.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Who knows where the dog is,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
please contact us.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
All the poles of the city

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
started to discuss.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Radio channels were connected.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Local people started to discuss

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
what kind of dogs are walking.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Where did they come from?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
What do they know?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
It was very interesting.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Then the next day

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
orange wallets

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
appeared on the streets.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
People started to pick them up.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Inside the wallet

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
there was an invitation

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
to open a store.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
People understood

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
that this store

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
was a joint venture.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It was an interesting event.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
The next day

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
the store was opened.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Everyone who found

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
an orange wallet

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
came to the store

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and gave a T-shirt

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
with the inscription

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
«The most honest person in the city».

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Orange oranges were given

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
to everyone who came

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
to the store.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
The number of people

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
who came to the store

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
was 30.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
It was a very interesting event.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
It was not very expensive.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It was a very interesting event.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
People discussed it for a long time.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I would like to tell you

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
that if you need

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
an interesting idea,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I recommend you

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
to contact the agency

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
which specializes in this.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
They are doing it very well.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Well,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
another tool is

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
direct marketing.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
It is a direct mail

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
or e-mail message

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
which we use

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
to communicate

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
with our clients.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
It is called direct marketing

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
because it is a direct personal

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
message to our client.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It works very effectively

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
if the strategy is planned,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
if it is not a one-time event

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
which we planned

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
to do once and forgot about it.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Direct marketing events

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
allow to maintain the database

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
in the current state constantly,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
to get feedback from the client,

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
to make a confidential offer,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
to communicate with the client,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
to identify the claims,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
to fix and eliminate them.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
It is a very large field

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
for work

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
which allows to achieve

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
the personalization we are talking about.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Although,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
some people think

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
that it is a thing of the past,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
however,

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
a direct mail message

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
is a very good result

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
in terms of its value.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
What are the disadvantages?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
First of all,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
not everyone reads it.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The effectiveness of the message

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
if it is 3-6%

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
is very good.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
As I said,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
the cost-benefit ratio

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
is very good.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Therefore,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
if you receive a direct message

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
after sending it,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
it is a great result.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
What is the direct marketing?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
First of all,

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
incoming calls.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
What can we do

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
with incoming calls?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
First of all,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
we can tell the information

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
about our products.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Second,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
we can switch to another product

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
of our client.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Third,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
we can set contacts

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
and put them in the database.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
It will be relevant

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
because the client contacted us himself.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
We can hold some competitions

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
by phone or by email

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
among the clients

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
who contact us on their own.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
We can also react

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
and work with incoming calls.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
What can we do with them?

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
First of all,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
we can make orders.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
We can call the clients

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and make orders.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Then,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
we can set contacts,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
make acquaintances,

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
find additional clients.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
It is a good tool.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Then,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
we can conduct marketing researches

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
and surveys.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Based on this,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
we can create our own database

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and make requests

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
for the analysis of the clients' wishes.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
It is a good communication

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
with the current clients,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
with the regular clients.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
We do it regularly.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
We communicate regularly

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
and find out the problems,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
wishes, and so on.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
It is a communication tool

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
after the event.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
We can evaluate the results

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
and see what has worked,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
what has not,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and so on.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
It is a valuable source of information

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
that we do not always

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
use effectively.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I would like to tell you

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
about the effectiveness of direct marketing

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
with the table you see on the slide.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Let's talk about

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
postage.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
If we take 100% of postage,

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
only 88% of them are opened.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
12% are thrown out

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
and not even opened.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
What happens to the remaining 88%?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
40% are read by the person

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
who is not intended.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
40% are read by the person

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
who is intended.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And 8% are thrown out again.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
What does the person

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
who is intended do?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
24% of them

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
are read and thrown out.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
They seem uninteresting to him.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
10% are put aside

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
and think,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I will deal with it later.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Only 6% get the answer.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Only 6% get the answer.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
And this is a very good result.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It is a very good result.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It is worse if such a percentage

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
is 1-2.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It means that either your base is not relevant

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
or your commercial offer was absolutely uninteresting

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
for your key client.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
You have wrongly determined his wishes.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
by direct marketing events

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
you can also

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
read additional material

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
in your lecture notebook.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
The main goal of the lecture notebook

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
is to provide a clear picture

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
of the main objectives

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
of the lecture.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
The main goal of the lecture notebook

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
is to provide a clear picture

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
of the main objectives

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
of the lecture.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I would like to touch on the form of reporting

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
and the control of the event.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I would like to say that

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
according to the results of all planned events

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
a media plan is developed.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
You can see its appearance on the slide

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
where we describe each event

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
and the time of the event,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
the place of the event

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and the budget.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Then the budget is summed up

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
by periods, months, quarters

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
as you prefer.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Why do we need such media plans?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Not only to plan and observe the plan

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
but also to make a political statement.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
If you have a media plan

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
with all the budget expenses,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
it is unlikely that the head

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
will emphasize something

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
to optimize the budget.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
When you have a common figure,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
it is easier to emphasize.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
We do not know what it is spent on.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And there is a temptation to

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
sequester this amount.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
When you have all the events clearly planned,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
it is unlikely that the head

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
will raise his hand

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
to emphasize a certain amount.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Because we clearly understand

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
what kind of event

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and what we need it for.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Therefore, I highly recommend

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
to make a plan and a budget

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
at your head.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
In conclusion, we will touch

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
on the calculation of the promotional effectiveness

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
of the event.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I will tell you the basic formulas

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
for calculating the effectiveness.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And you will have tables in your notebooks

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
and there will be a task

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
for calculating the effectiveness

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
of certain actions.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Everything is clearly described

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
according to the formulas.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
What to calculate,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
what we hold the event for.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Yes, probably to increase sales,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
to achieve a certain result,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
to ensure the popularity of the product.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
But I want to say that

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
the effectiveness of the event can be calculated

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
only by applying

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
to the stimulation of sales.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The effectiveness of advertising

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
can also be calculated, but it will not be accurate.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Because there, in addition to the economic effect,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
there is a communication effect,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
the number of contacts,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
the increase in recognition, and so on.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
You can find out all these things

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
only by contacting the agency

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
and conducting an additional survey of consumers.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Many companies simply do not go

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
because it is additional costs.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
This can be done at least once a year

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
to assess the popularity

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
of your brand or your trading brand.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
But the economic effectiveness

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
is the easiest

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
and most effective

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
to calculate precisely by events

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
on the stimulation of sales.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Here are the basic formulas.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
The first formula is the formula of profitability.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Everyone knows it.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
When we take the additional sales,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
the amount of additional sales,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
subtract the cost of the product

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
that we additionally sold

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
and the costs of the event itself

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
and divide it all by the costs,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
you get the coefficient.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
If this coefficient is less than one,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
your share was loss.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
If it is equal to one,

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
your share has passed zero.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Roughly speaking,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
how much you received

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
and how much you spent.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
But if your share

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
has a coefficient of more than one,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
you have already worked

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
for the profit of the company.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Naturally, the higher the coefficient,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
the better.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
It can be 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
It is ideal.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
The more, the better.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
The main thing is that it is more than one.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Then your share worked effectively.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
And one more formula

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
that will help you calculate

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
the effectiveness of the share.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It is the definition of the share loss

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
in the additional product turnover.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
What is the point of this calculation?

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
For example, you sold the product

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and additionally sold 100 units

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
for 1,000 rubles.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Accordingly, you received

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
100,000 additional rubles.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But how much you spent

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
from this amount

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
should be determined.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
That is, not the share of the total turnover

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
because the total could be sold

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
without the share.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
But how much additional income

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
you spent is important.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
It shows how much additional money

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
you earned for the owner.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And this formula works

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
very well and effectively.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It shows what your owner

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
wants to see.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
This is what you calculate.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You take all the costs

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
that you spent on the share.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Divide it by the additional income

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
that you received

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
and multiply it by 100%.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
You get a share of the costs

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
in the additional income.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Note, not in the total, but in the additional.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
This is how you can calculate

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
the share.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
This is a whole formula

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
that is described in detail

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
in your work materials.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
You can refer to it

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and, moreover,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
do practical work,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
do tasks

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
to calculate the effectiveness

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
of a particular share.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Dear colleagues,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
today we have discussed

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
the main tools for promoting a product

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
to the market,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
no matter if it is new

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
or a new company.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
We have seen how to use

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
advertising tools,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
how to use public communication tools,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
the main practical methods

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
of sales promotion

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
aimed at both the trading link

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
and the end users.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
We have seen how direct marketing tools

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
work.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And we have seen the formula

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
for calculating the effectiveness

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
of a particular share.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
In your lecture materials

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
you can find more detailed information.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
And I say goodbye to you.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I wish you success,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
success in promoting

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
your product,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
bringing new brands,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
new interesting positions

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
to the Russian market.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
All the best. Goodbye.
