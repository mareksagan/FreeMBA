00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Now let's move on to the next question.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.840
The next question is the second situation.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.880
The first situation was a one-time process.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.920
You give me a loan, and I buy you.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.120
Now the second situation.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.320
The client who made a purchase once becomes a regular buyer.

00:18.320 --> 00:23.040
The client who made a purchase once becomes a regular buyer,

00:23.040 --> 00:25.200
but in the future does not refuse to buy.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.240
This is a realistic assumption.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.120
There is no doubt about it.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.720
It happens quite often.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.480
Let's take a look.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.840
Again, if the company does not provide a loan,

00:39.840 --> 00:40.880
then nothing will happen to it.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.800
If the company provides a loan,

00:42.800 --> 00:48.720
then on the one hand, it risks its variable costs.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.640
Their volume is V.

00:51.520 --> 01:02.000
But then it can get a value of P if the client pays.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.200
It turns out that in the next period,

01:09.200 --> 01:13.440
the company either does not receive anything,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.280
because the client does not pay,

01:15.280 --> 01:20.400
or receives a full-time payment if the client pays.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.920
But since we assumed that the client pays regularly,

01:23.920 --> 01:31.120
then there will be a constant difference between P and V variable costs.

01:31.120 --> 01:35.120
The cash flow over a period will be the difference

01:35.120 --> 01:39.440
between the cost of the product and the variable costs.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.600
Please pay attention to the slide on which the second situation is described.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.640
Let's move on to the next slide, if you have seen it.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.000
The cost of each new client in this case

01:52.000 --> 01:58.400
will be estimated as the profit minus the cost of the company divided by R.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.760
Please remember the formula for the current cost.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.560
Please remember the formula for the valuation of the share price

02:06.560 --> 02:08.160
with a constant dividend.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.720
Don't you think this formula is similar?

02:10.720 --> 02:13.040
Absolutely right, it is similar.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.960
This is the same formula,

02:14.960 --> 02:22.400
but instead of the dividend, we have a difference of P minus V.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.000
Now, about the effectiveness of lending a loan.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.200
We must calculate the NPV of this solution.

02:29.200 --> 02:34.320
I repeat that we spend our V variable costs,

02:34.320 --> 02:39.120
but on the other hand, we get a certain flow of money.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.840
This flow is constant.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.640
What is it?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.200
It is that on the one hand,

02:47.200 --> 02:51.040
the amount is the difference between P minus V,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.200
and on the other hand,

02:53.200 --> 02:57.840
there should be an amendment to the risk of not fulfilling its obligations.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.320
The risk of the client not paying.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.360
This risk remains, it has not been canceled.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.520
As a result, our formula will take the following form.

03:07.520 --> 03:13.280
We must correct the cost of each new client

03:14.000 --> 03:17.760
to the interest rate of non-return of money

03:17.760 --> 03:25.440
and compare it with our costs for this solution.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.560
As a result, we get the difference between the variable costs

03:30.560 --> 03:35.360
and the cost of each new client with an amendment to the risk of not fulfilling obligations.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.000
Let's see what happens with this formula,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.480
which is reflected in our slide.

03:40.960 --> 03:49.680
It turns out that it costs only 15 units to find out the client's payment ability.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.440
These are our variable costs.

03:51.440 --> 03:59.200
The cost of the client is an incredibly large amount of 451 units.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.560
We calculated this using the first formula.

04:02.560 --> 04:08.240
If we now calculate the NPV of our decision to provide a loan under such conditions,

04:08.560 --> 04:14.160
we will find that even if we take the same 30% of the non-returners,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.200
it will still be a positive NPV.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.040
The cost of our client is more than 400,

04:21.040 --> 04:26.160
and the cost of finding out this case is only 15.

04:26.160 --> 04:33.280
So, if we take a look, the share of non-returners can be 70% or 80%.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.560
Please count it yourself during the break.

04:37.440 --> 04:43.600
This situation once again emphasizes that providing commercial loans,

04:43.600 --> 04:46.800
production loans, is a very profitable business.

04:46.800 --> 04:54.560
Of course, it is risky, because no one has canceled a 100% refusal of a loan.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.160
Nevertheless, according to our calculations, it is very profitable.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.000
It is not surprising that many companies are activating their activities

05:02.000 --> 05:05.200
in terms of providing such loans.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.440
Let's move on.

05:09.120 --> 05:15.760
Now we will discuss the topic of the NPV and sales volume interconnection.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.880
The interconnection of decision-making in the sales volume and NPV.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.240
Of course, we can also consider other topics,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.640
such as the connection of NPV with amortization,

05:26.640 --> 05:28.880
the connection of NPV with taxes.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.120
But the logic is the same everywhere.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.200
We will consider it in this example.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.160
So, the basic question.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.160
At what level of sales will the company be provided with financial profitability?

05:42.160 --> 05:46.400
At what level of sales will the company be provided with financial profitability?

05:46.400 --> 05:49.520
We will consider three levels of profitability.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.120
Minimum, calculated and financial.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.600
As you understand, the financial profitability level is the level

05:57.600 --> 06:01.840
at which the NPV of the project, the NPV of the business is zero.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.800
These are very high requirements for the project.

06:04.800 --> 06:09.360
Calculated profitability level is the level of sales

06:09.360 --> 06:15.840
at which the company can cover its permanent costs

06:15.840 --> 06:19.600
and can cover its amortization.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.840
Permanent costs and amortization.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.880
Finally, there is the simplest level, the first level.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.160
This is the so-called minimum profitability level of sales.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.440
This is the level of sales at which the revenue covers only the permanent costs.

06:35.440 --> 06:41.040
At the same time, there can be no profit, no amortization.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.480
This is just the coverage of the permanent costs.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.400
We will operate with the term

06:46.400 --> 06:49.120
Operational cash flow.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.640
OASF.

06:50.640 --> 06:57.520
This is one of the options for direct calculation of cash flows.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.680
It includes the company's income

07:01.680 --> 07:04.400
up to the deduction of interest and taxes,

07:04.400 --> 07:08.080
plus amortization and minus taxes.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.440
At the minimum profitability level,

07:11.440 --> 07:15.520
the operational cash flow of the company

07:15.520 --> 07:19.040
must be equal to zero.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.720
Accordingly, at the calculated profitability level,

07:22.720 --> 07:27.440
I repeat, at the calculated profitability level,

07:27.440 --> 07:30.480
the company's cash flows must provide

07:30.480 --> 07:33.600
the coverage of the permanent costs

07:33.600 --> 07:36.000
and cover the amortization

07:36.000 --> 07:39.680
in the operational cash flow.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.400
Finally, at the financial profitability level,

07:42.400 --> 07:47.520
we must get the operational cash flows in full.

07:47.520 --> 07:53.600
But with such an estimate, to achieve zero NPV.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.120
Please refer to our slides.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.880
You can see that there is a dependence

08:00.880 --> 08:03.440
between the operational cash flows

08:03.440 --> 08:06.080
and the volume of sales.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.760
The formula for this dependence is presented on the slide,

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
where Q is the volume of sales

08:11.680 --> 08:14.720
and F is the permanent costs.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.440
P minus V is the price of the product

08:19.440 --> 08:21.440
minus the variable costs.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.760
We are already familiar with this term.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.440
So, on the same slide,

08:27.440 --> 08:30.480
the formula for determining

08:30.480 --> 08:32.560
the minimum profitability level of sales is presented.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.400
I say the formula,

08:34.400 --> 08:37.840
the difference between all three formulas

08:37.840 --> 08:39.920
will be only in the volume of numbers.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.560
So, pay attention.

08:42.560 --> 08:46.480
The minimum profitability level of sales,

08:46.480 --> 08:48.080
Q is the level of sales.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.000
We substitute the formula for the value.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.040
Let's start with the indicator.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.800
41 minus 21.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.680
It is the difference between the price of the product

08:59.680 --> 09:01.120
and the variable costs.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.320
It is clear.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.960
Now let's go up to the indicator.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.160
On the left side of the indicator,

09:08.160 --> 09:09.200
we see the number 600.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.680
These are the permanent costs.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.360
On the right side, we see zero.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.240
This means that the operational cash flow is zero.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.680
There is no amortization, no profit, etc.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.720
In order to ensure

09:24.720 --> 09:28.240
the minimum profitability level of sales,

09:28.240 --> 09:32.480
this company must sell 30 units of its product.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.120
With this volume of sales,

09:35.120 --> 09:39.840
this company can cover its permanent costs.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.720
Now let's move on to the next slide.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.640
Here, unlike the previous formula,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.680
the difference is only in the number

09:49.680 --> 09:51.760
above the line on the right.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.280
Pay attention.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.240
The same 600 permanent costs,

09:56.240 --> 10:00.080
the same price of the product 41 minus 21,

10:00.080 --> 10:06.480
but now we have 640 units of amortization

10:06.480 --> 10:09.200
in the structure of the operational cash flow.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.640
So, in order for the company to cover the amortization

10:14.720 --> 10:17.200
and cover the permanent costs,

10:17.200 --> 10:22.000
it must produce 62 units of its product.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.720
It must produce 62 units of its product,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.320
produce and sell.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.200
Let's make an addition.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.480
Produce and sell.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.320
This was the calculated profit-free sales level.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.000
Now we need to determine

10:38.000 --> 10:41.040
the financial profit-free sales level

10:41.040 --> 10:47.280
at which this project is provided with zero NPV.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.400
To do this, we need to determine

10:50.400 --> 10:57.200
the cost of the annual size of the operational cash flow,

10:57.200 --> 11:01.920
which will include the amortization of those 40-640 units

11:01.920 --> 11:03.120
that we talked about.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.320
So, we have the conditions.

11:06.320 --> 11:11.360
Please pay attention to our slide.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.000
Everything is described in detail there.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.360
I will only say in words that we have the conditions

11:17.360 --> 11:21.920
that the total amount of investment in the project

11:21.920 --> 11:23.920
is 3.2 million.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.720
The profitability in the market is 20% per year.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.960
We need to determine

11:29.920 --> 11:34.480
the annual cash flow

11:34.480 --> 11:37.600
since the project is designed for 5 years.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.440
What should be the annual cash flow?

11:41.440 --> 11:45.120
Please remember that we have gone through

11:45.120 --> 11:47.360
the model of the cost of annuity.

11:47.360 --> 11:51.680
This model assumes that you can calculate

11:51.680 --> 11:56.000
the cost of a set, a series,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.840
annual payments of the same amount,

11:59.840 --> 12:02.480
if you know the amount,

12:02.480 --> 12:04.480
the number of years or periods,

12:04.480 --> 12:06.000
and the interest rate.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.960
In this case, the interest rate is 20,

12:08.960 --> 12:11.280
the number of years is 5,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.600
and we know the total amount.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.000
We know the cost of annuity,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.400
but we do not know the cost.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.240
In the formula, it was the analog of the size of the coupon.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.000
It was the size of the coupon,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.480
and in this formula we talk about the parameters

12:28.480 --> 12:30.480
called operational cash flow.

12:30.480 --> 12:35.680
We use the capitalization coefficient

12:35.680 --> 12:40.560
and we get that the annual nominal cost

12:40.560 --> 12:45.920
of the company's cash flows is 1,070 units.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.480
That is, every year 1,070 units

12:48.480 --> 12:52.800
should be generated by this project.

12:53.680 --> 13:01.120
So, in order to ensure the financial

13:01.120 --> 13:03.360
profitability of our project,

13:03.360 --> 13:11.840
you probably noticed that we took 3,200,

13:11.840 --> 13:14.240
we took the cost of our investments.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.040
In fact, we could say that we have

13:17.040 --> 13:18.400
the cost of the investments,

13:18.400 --> 13:22.720
we have the cash flow from these investments,

13:22.720 --> 13:28.800
but their cost, I repeat,

13:28.800 --> 13:33.920
if we took a different number,

13:33.920 --> 13:37.360
for example, we said that we have a profit

13:37.360 --> 13:39.360
from our project of 3,300,

13:39.360 --> 13:43.520
then we would calculate for our cash flow

13:43.520 --> 13:49.200
OSF based on the fact that NPV is greater than zero.

13:50.160 --> 13:54.640
In this case, we take 3,200,

13:54.640 --> 13:58.240
this number corresponds to both the investment

13:58.240 --> 14:01.440
and the cash flow from our project.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.440
Since the two numbers are the same,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
NPV is zero.

14:05.440 --> 14:12.160
So, when we set the value of the operational cash flow

14:12.160 --> 14:15.680
in the formula, we get 83.5.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.320
This means that the company must sell 84 units of goods

14:20.320 --> 14:28.480
annually to ensure the financial profitability,

14:28.480 --> 14:32.000
that is, to ensure the zero NPV of its project.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.120
Note that under the conditions of this project,

14:37.120 --> 14:40.880
85 units of goods should be produced,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.880
and we have a financial profitability of 84.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.120
The difference is very small,

14:47.120 --> 14:50.800
this is a rather dangerous situation,

14:50.800 --> 14:55.040
because the project has no reserve.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.480
Without a reserve, it can become a victim

14:58.480 --> 15:01.680
of any change, a rather negative change

15:01.680 --> 15:03.680
in the interest rate on the market.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.680
But in any case,

15:05.680 --> 15:09.040
we have seen three situations.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
The most important, of course,

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
is the last point,

15:13.040 --> 15:17.440
namely the financial non-profitable sales level.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
Now we will consider the same,

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
but on a graph.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.440
Please turn to the slide.

15:23.440 --> 15:29.440
Here you see a line that reflects the dependence

15:29.440 --> 15:33.440
between the cash flows and the sales volume.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.440
You see three points here,

15:35.440 --> 15:37.440
the minimum level, the calculated level,

15:37.840 --> 15:41.840
and the financial non-profitable sales level.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.840
How do they differ?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.840
This is just an illustration,

15:45.840 --> 15:47.840
I hope it will help you to remember,

15:47.840 --> 15:49.840
better realize this point.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.840
Of course, the company can work for some time

15:53.840 --> 15:57.840
and at a minimum level of non-profitability.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.840
Of course, the company can work for a long time

16:01.840 --> 16:05.840
and at a calculated level of non-profitability.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.240
But in order for the company

16:08.240 --> 16:10.240
to be able to count on capital growth,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
it must exceed

16:12.240 --> 16:16.240
the financial non-profitable sales level.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.240
If the company is counting on the stock market,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.240
on the growth in the stock market,

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
then it must operate

16:24.240 --> 16:26.240
to the cash flows

16:26.240 --> 16:28.240
and strive to ensure

16:28.240 --> 16:30.240
that the cash flows

16:30.240 --> 16:32.240
exceed the calculated value.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.240
The next point is the choice

16:38.240 --> 16:40.240
of several devices

16:40.240 --> 16:42.240
with the same functions

16:42.240 --> 16:44.240
of the device

16:44.240 --> 16:48.240
that is the least financially expensive.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.240
Again, I ask you to refer to the slide.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.240
The basic question

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
is how to choose a device

16:56.240 --> 16:58.240
with the same functions

16:58.240 --> 17:00.240
but with different service terms

17:00.240 --> 17:02.240
that is the most profitable

17:02.240 --> 17:04.240
from a financial point of view.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.640
We will have an example.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.640
The logic itself is very simple.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.640
It is based on discounting.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.640
Let's look at an example.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.640
We have two devices.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
The first one costs 100 units.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.640
It will last for two years.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.640
Annual costs for this device

17:20.640 --> 17:22.640
are 10 units.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.640
The second device

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
costs more.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.640
140 units.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.640
It will last for three years more

17:30.640 --> 17:32.640
and annual costs

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
for this device

17:35.040 --> 17:37.040
will be 8 units.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
How can we compare

17:39.040 --> 17:41.040
these two devices?

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
We must calculate

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
the cost of these devices.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.040
The cost of these devices

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
is the cost of the device.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
If it was a finished object

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
that would provide a profit,

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
we would consider it

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
a profit from the project.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
We would consider it a profit.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
In this case,

18:01.440 --> 18:03.440
it is a mechanism,

18:03.440 --> 18:05.440
a part of a whole.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
We can evaluate its financial efficiency

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
only from the point of view

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
of the costs of this project.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.440
The rule is simple.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.440
The lower the costs,

18:15.440 --> 18:17.440
the better this device is.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.440
With the equality of all

18:19.440 --> 18:21.440
other technical characteristics.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
Please refer to the slide.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
We calculate

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
the PV,

18:31.840 --> 18:33.840
the cost of both devices,

18:33.840 --> 18:35.840
taking into account

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
the 10% discount rate.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
The first device

18:39.840 --> 18:41.840
is the price of its purchase

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
plus the discounted costs

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
for the first year

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
plus the discounted costs

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
for the second year.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
It is 117 kopecks.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
The second device

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
costs 140 kopecks more

18:55.840 --> 18:57.840
plus the discounts

18:58.240 --> 19:00.240
for the third year.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.240
The result is 159 kopecks.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.240
What is better?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.240
159 or 117?

19:08.240 --> 19:10.240
We cannot answer this question

19:10.240 --> 19:12.240
because

19:12.240 --> 19:14.240
these two numbers

19:14.240 --> 19:16.240
have different periods.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.240
The first number, 117,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.240
is calculated for two years.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.240
The second number, 159,

19:22.240 --> 19:24.240
is calculated for three years.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.240
It would seem to divide the first number

19:26.640 --> 19:28.640
by two, and the second number by three.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.640
This is the solution.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.640
No, this is not the right solution.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.640
This solution is for accounting,

19:34.640 --> 19:36.640
for nominal economics.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.640
We are talking about economics

19:38.640 --> 19:40.640
where there is a discounting procedure.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.640
Therefore, we must use

19:42.640 --> 19:44.640
the model of

19:44.640 --> 19:46.640
the value estimation

19:46.640 --> 19:48.640
of annuity.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.640
In this case,

19:50.640 --> 19:52.640
117 and 159

19:52.640 --> 19:54.640
are the value

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
of annuity

19:57.040 --> 19:59.040
which is

19:59.040 --> 20:01.040
two years

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
or three years.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.040
Again,

20:05.040 --> 20:07.040
we look at

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
our slide

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
and see

20:11.040 --> 20:13.040
that the value

20:13.040 --> 20:15.040
of annuity

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
for the first

20:17.040 --> 20:19.040
device is

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
67 units,

20:21.040 --> 20:23.040
for the second 64 units.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.440
Again,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
we have

20:27.440 --> 20:29.440
two-year expenses

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
which are 117

20:31.440 --> 20:33.440
and three-year expenses, 159.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
The value of

20:35.440 --> 20:37.440
the first device

20:37.440 --> 20:39.440
is 117 units.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.440
This is

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
equivalent to

20:43.440 --> 20:45.440
two payments,

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
two equal payments

20:47.440 --> 20:49.440
for the first and second year.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.440
How do we calculate

20:51.840 --> 20:53.840
the payment?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
We must use the formula of annuity.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
1.74 is the capitalization

20:57.840 --> 20:59.840
coefficient

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
obtained by the formula 14.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
We need to use

21:03.840 --> 21:05.840
the number of years

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
for the capitalization coefficient

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
2 years, the interest rate

21:09.840 --> 21:11.840
10%.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
We have determined

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
that if

21:15.840 --> 21:17.840
two times

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
67 is paid,

21:20.240 --> 21:22.240
we get 117.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.240
The second device

21:24.240 --> 21:26.240
is 159,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
the total expenses for it,

21:28.240 --> 21:30.240
and 2.49, the capitalization coefficient.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.240
For its calculation, we took

21:32.240 --> 21:34.240
three years

21:34.240 --> 21:36.240
and the interest rate.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.240
What happens if

21:38.240 --> 21:40.240
64 is paid three times in a row,

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
64, 64, 64,

21:42.240 --> 21:44.240
three times in a row,

21:44.240 --> 21:46.240
the total value of

21:46.240 --> 21:48.240
three 64 is

21:48.640 --> 21:50.640
159.9, almost 160.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.640
Now we have to

21:52.640 --> 21:54.640
compare two numbers

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
given to one year.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.640
Remember,

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
at the beginning

22:00.640 --> 22:02.640
we determined

22:02.640 --> 22:04.640
the total expenses

22:04.640 --> 22:06.640
for each of the devices,

22:06.640 --> 22:08.640
and then we brought these expenses,

22:08.640 --> 22:10.640
which were different in time,

22:10.640 --> 22:12.640
to one year.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
It turns out 67.64.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.640
Of course, we must

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
choose the second device,

22:19.040 --> 22:21.040
because the expenses for it

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
in the annual measurement are less.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.040
The expenses for it

22:25.040 --> 22:27.040
in the annual measurement are less,

22:27.040 --> 22:29.040
they are only 64.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.040
At this point, we begin

22:31.040 --> 22:33.040
to finish our course,

22:33.040 --> 22:35.040
which, I repeat,

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
consists of the basic rules

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
of the investment project assessment,

22:39.040 --> 22:41.040
some technical solutions

22:41.040 --> 22:43.040
that we have just disassembled,

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
the application of these basic rules,

22:45.440 --> 22:47.440
and the NPV for the current

22:47.440 --> 22:49.440
analysis of economic activity.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
In conclusion,

22:51.440 --> 22:53.440
we will analyze the last point.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.440
The fact is that

22:55.440 --> 22:57.440
investment projects

22:57.440 --> 22:59.440
can be considered

22:59.440 --> 23:01.440
by a company

23:01.440 --> 23:03.440
in parallel with many other projects.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
It often happens that

23:07.440 --> 23:09.440
in the work of one company

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
there are two or three

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
projects,

23:13.840 --> 23:15.840
as practice shows,

23:15.840 --> 23:17.840
projects can be

23:17.840 --> 23:19.840
independent,

23:19.840 --> 23:21.840
or they can be dependent.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.840
If the projects are independent,

23:23.840 --> 23:25.840
then we have no problems.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.840
We use the tool

23:27.840 --> 23:29.840
we talked about

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
and try to choose

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
the best project

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
taking into account

23:35.840 --> 23:37.840
the realities of the environment.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
If they are independent,

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
then the projects can be dependent.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
In this case,

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
we will name

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
four types of dependence.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
There is a dependency

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
that is necessary,

23:53.840 --> 23:55.840
replacing,

23:55.840 --> 23:57.840
excluding,

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
and statistical.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
In our slide,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.840
they are described.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
Project A and Project B

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
can be interconnected,

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
dependent,

24:09.840 --> 24:11.840
so that if the implementation

24:12.240 --> 24:14.240
of Project A

24:14.240 --> 24:16.240
leads to

24:16.240 --> 24:18.240
the deterioration of Project B's parameters,

24:18.240 --> 24:20.240
or

24:20.240 --> 24:22.240
if the implementation of Project A

24:22.240 --> 24:24.240
leads to the improvement

24:24.240 --> 24:26.240
of Project B's parameters,

24:26.240 --> 24:28.240
or

24:28.240 --> 24:30.240
if the implementation of Project A

24:30.240 --> 24:32.240
leads to the fact that Project B

24:32.240 --> 24:34.240
cannot be implemented at all.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
These are called mutually excluding projects.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.240
When the implementation of one

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
makes the implementation of another impossible.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.640
Or financially unprofitable.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.640
Finally,

24:44.640 --> 24:46.640
Projects A and B can be called

24:46.640 --> 24:48.640
statistically dependent

24:48.640 --> 24:50.640
if they depend on some external event

24:50.640 --> 24:52.640
of statistical nature

24:52.640 --> 24:54.640
or probability nature.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.640
Please,

24:58.640 --> 25:00.640
refer to the slides

25:00.640 --> 25:02.640
and we will consider a graph

25:02.640 --> 25:04.640
showing

25:04.640 --> 25:06.640
two mutually excluding

25:06.640 --> 25:08.640
Projects A and B.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.040
The mutually excluding

25:11.040 --> 25:13.040
is a vivid example

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
of how to act

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
when you have dependent projects.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.040
First,

25:19.040 --> 25:21.040
let's look at two lines.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
Here,

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
we have the vertical NPV

25:25.040 --> 25:27.040
and the horizontal profitability.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
We consider

25:29.040 --> 25:31.040
the interconnection

25:31.040 --> 25:33.040
of NPV and profitability

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
of two of our projects.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
They are mutually excluding.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
Project A and Project B.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
The intersection point

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
is the point X.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.440
By the way,

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
as you can guess,

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
the NPV of both projects

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
must be zero.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.440
These projects have IRR.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.440
Here it is indicated on the graph.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
What is interesting

26:01.440 --> 26:03.440
before we move on

26:03.440 --> 26:05.440
to the topic we have already discussed?

26:05.840 --> 26:07.840
At the point X,

26:07.840 --> 26:09.840
Project B

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
was more profitable

26:11.840 --> 26:13.840
than Project A.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
After the point X,

26:15.840 --> 26:17.840
the profitability of the projects

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
changes and Project A

26:19.840 --> 26:21.840
becomes more profitable

26:21.840 --> 26:23.840
than Project B.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
Please, note that

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840
on this graph

26:27.840 --> 26:29.840
on the left

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
of the internal profitability

26:31.840 --> 26:33.840
there are

26:34.240 --> 26:36.240
three dotted lines.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.240
They intersect

26:38.240 --> 26:40.240
with two fat dots

26:40.240 --> 26:42.240
that indicate the points.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.240
Please, note that

26:44.240 --> 26:46.240
at one level of risk,

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
Project B

26:48.240 --> 26:50.240
has more profitability

26:50.240 --> 26:52.240
than Project A.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.240
At one level of risk.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.240
This determines

26:56.240 --> 26:58.240
that this project

26:58.240 --> 27:00.240
is more profitable.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
In this case.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.640
If we move to the right

27:04.640 --> 27:06.640
of the intersection,

27:06.640 --> 27:08.640
we will see the opposite picture.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.640
At the same level of risk,

27:10.640 --> 27:12.640
in this case,

27:12.640 --> 27:14.640
of profitability,

27:14.640 --> 27:16.640
Project A

27:16.640 --> 27:18.640
will be more profitable

27:18.640 --> 27:20.640
than Project B.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.640
Its line will be higher

27:22.640 --> 27:24.640
than Project B.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.640
This is for your information.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.640
Now,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.640
as for the rules

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
of analysis of dependent projects.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
The thing is

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
that when you accept

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
Project A

27:39.040 --> 27:41.040
and it somehow affects

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
Project B,

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
you should keep in mind

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
that the money flows

27:47.040 --> 27:49.040
that you generate

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
after accepting Project A

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
should include

27:53.040 --> 27:55.040
the changes that occur

27:55.040 --> 27:57.040
in Project B.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.040
In other words,

27:59.440 --> 28:01.440
you have accepted

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
Project A

28:03.440 --> 28:05.440
out of the exception of Project B.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
You have accepted Project A.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
You will count all the money flows

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
through it.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
You should keep in mind

28:13.440 --> 28:15.440
that you did not accept Project B.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.440
If Project B

28:17.440 --> 28:19.440
brought you some financial profit,

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
it means

28:21.440 --> 28:23.440
that you are incurring a financial loss.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
You should reflect

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
this state on the money flows

28:27.840 --> 28:29.840
of Project A.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
I will repeat it one more time.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.840
You have two projects

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
and you can choose only one.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.840
After choosing one,

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
you should take into account

28:39.840 --> 28:41.840
the consequences of rejection of the second one

28:41.840 --> 28:43.840
and add them

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
to the money flows

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
of the basic project.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
After that, you will make

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
all the standard calculations

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
that we talked about.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.840
This was the last

28:56.240 --> 28:58.240
remark in this course

28:58.240 --> 29:00.240
regarding the analysis

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
of the financial flows

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
of investment projects

29:04.240 --> 29:06.240
for making investment decisions.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
Now,

29:10.240 --> 29:12.240
we need to sum up

29:12.240 --> 29:14.240
our course.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.240
We have considered the need

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
for fundamentally new thinking.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
Perhaps, at some stage

29:20.240 --> 29:22.240
you have lost the thread.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.240
You have stopped understanding

29:24.640 --> 29:26.640
what we are talking about.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.640
Perhaps, it is so.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.640
Please, go back to the beginning

29:30.640 --> 29:32.640
and try to read the course

29:32.640 --> 29:34.640
again

29:34.640 --> 29:36.640
about the need for examples

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
and changes in thinking.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.640
This is the basis

29:40.640 --> 29:42.640
for further understanding

29:42.640 --> 29:44.640
of the logic

29:44.640 --> 29:46.640
of the money flows.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.640
In fact, there is nothing wrong with it.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
You just need to understand the logic.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.640
The first one is

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
the value of the change in thinking.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
The change in thinking

29:57.040 --> 29:59.040
leads to the change

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
in the price of the asset.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
This change in the price of the asset

30:03.040 --> 30:05.040
led us to consider

30:05.040 --> 30:07.040
the issue of the value

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
of the financial assets.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
We have discussed

30:11.040 --> 30:13.040
the discounting

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
and the discounting coefficient.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
Then we have discussed

30:17.040 --> 30:19.040
the effective interest rate

30:19.040 --> 30:21.040
and asked you to go

30:21.440 --> 30:23.440
to the bank

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
to conduct a small study.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
Finally, we have discussed

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
three options for the value of the asset.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
The value of the loan, the value of the bond

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
and the value of the shares.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
I will repeat that

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
each of these values

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
is based on the same phenomenon

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
namely, the discounting

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
of the money flows.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.440
In the case of the loan,

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
the return of the principal amount

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
along with the interest.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
In the case of the shares,

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
the return of the dividends

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
or another analog

30:55.840 --> 30:57.840
without the return of the principal amount.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.840
The return of dividends

30:59.840 --> 31:01.840
during an indefinite period.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.840
So,

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
we have understood

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
this logic, I hope.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
Our next step

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
was to understand

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
how we will calculate

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
the value of the investment project.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
We need to know

31:18.240 --> 31:20.240
the discounting rate

31:20.240 --> 31:22.240
or rather, we need to know how to choose it

31:22.240 --> 31:24.240
and we need to know

31:24.240 --> 31:26.240
how to calculate the money flows

31:26.240 --> 31:28.240
of the investment project.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.240
After all,

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
the money flows from the shares

31:32.240 --> 31:34.240
are mostly dividends.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.240
The money flows from the project

31:36.240 --> 31:38.240
are completely different.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.240
We have considered

31:40.240 --> 31:42.240
possible options

31:42.240 --> 31:44.240
namely, the choice of the market index,

31:44.240 --> 31:46.240
the choice of the risk-free rate

31:46.640 --> 31:48.640
and what else we had.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.640
Alternative rates

31:50.640 --> 31:52.640
that exist.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.640
This was about

31:54.640 --> 31:56.640
the possibility of borrowing on the market

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
or investing in alternative projects.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.640
Finally,

32:00.640 --> 32:02.640
we have disassembled

32:02.640 --> 32:04.640
two models,

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
the average capital expenditure

32:06.640 --> 32:08.640
and the CAPM model

32:08.640 --> 32:10.640
for the valuation of long-term assets.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.640
The CAPM model

32:12.640 --> 32:14.640
shows us

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
the profitability of the asset

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
and the profitability of the market

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
are interconnected

32:21.040 --> 32:23.040
and shows the number of measurements

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
of this interconnection.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.040
The average capital expenditure

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
is shown by the VISCC.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.040
It shows

32:31.040 --> 32:33.040
the maximum expenses

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
of the company

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
for the maintenance of its capital.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.040
How much does it cost to maintain capital?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.040
It is like the main funds.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
How much does it cost to maintain the machine?

32:43.440 --> 32:45.440
So,

32:45.440 --> 32:47.440
we have also disassembled

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
the cash flows.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
We have discussed the cash flow

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
as a method of calculation

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
based on the

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
indirect method.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.440
To do this,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
we had to

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
understand

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
that there are three

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
components of the cash flow.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
This is the cash flow from the main activity,

33:09.440 --> 33:11.440
from the investment

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
and from the financial.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
When we add them together,

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
we get the total amount of the cash flow.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
This amount

33:19.840 --> 33:21.840
must be equal to the difference

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
of the balance in the accounts

33:23.840 --> 33:25.840
at the beginning and at the end of the period.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.840
To calculate the income

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
from the main activity,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.840
we must take the profit

33:31.840 --> 33:33.840
of the company

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
from the report on profits and losses,

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
restore it to the amount of amortization,

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
restore it to the amount of profits and losses,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.240
restore it to the amount of non-realized profits

33:42.240 --> 33:44.240
and non-realized losses.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.240
If we take the non-realized profit,

33:46.240 --> 33:48.240
we take it with a minus sign,

33:48.240 --> 33:50.240
if the loss,

33:50.240 --> 33:52.240
then with a plus sign.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.240
And then we restore it

33:54.240 --> 33:56.240
to the balance in the article.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.240
So,

33:58.240 --> 34:00.240
the investment activity

34:00.240 --> 34:02.240
is the purchase of sales,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.240
the purchase of equipment,

34:04.240 --> 34:06.240
this is the investment,

34:06.240 --> 34:08.240
and finally,

34:08.640 --> 34:10.640
the financial activity,

34:10.640 --> 34:12.640
namely, the issuance of shares,

34:12.640 --> 34:14.640
the issuance of bonds,

34:14.640 --> 34:16.640
repayment of debts,

34:16.640 --> 34:18.640
repayment of bonds,

34:18.640 --> 34:20.640
payment of dividends.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.640
So,

34:22.640 --> 34:24.640
we have discussed how to find a discount rate,

34:24.640 --> 34:26.640
we have discussed how to calculate the cash flow of the project.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.640
Now,

34:28.640 --> 34:30.640
we have all the parameters

34:30.640 --> 34:32.640
necessary to calculate

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
the cost of the investment project.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
We calculate it.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.040
Having calculated it,

34:39.040 --> 34:41.040
we can move on

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
to the main actions.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
The main actions

34:45.040 --> 34:47.040
are

34:47.040 --> 34:49.040
to calculate

34:49.040 --> 34:51.040
the NPV,

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
the net cost,

34:53.040 --> 34:55.040
the difference between

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
the costs and the income

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
of the project.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
To calculate the IRR,

35:01.040 --> 35:03.040
the internal income rate,

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
we need to determine

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
at what interest rate

35:07.440 --> 35:09.440
the cost of the money is,

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
at what income rate

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
the NPV of the project will be equal to zero.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
Then there is the index of profitability

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
and the term of the purchase.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.440
Both parameters

35:19.440 --> 35:21.440
in terms of discounted value.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
Four main ones.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.440
So,

35:25.440 --> 35:27.440
we have already considered

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
several examples

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
of how to use

35:31.840 --> 35:33.840
the NPV methodology

35:33.840 --> 35:35.840
to analyze the volume of sales,

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
to analyze

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
the credit policy,

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
to analyze the balance on the accounts,

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
to analyze the choice

35:43.840 --> 35:45.840
of one or another

35:45.840 --> 35:47.840
type of financial policy.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.840
Finally,

35:49.840 --> 35:51.840
the last thing

35:51.840 --> 35:53.840
we need to mention

35:53.840 --> 35:55.840
is that

35:55.840 --> 35:57.840
investment projects

35:57.840 --> 35:59.840
are not

36:00.240 --> 36:02.240
always dependent.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.240
In this case,

36:04.240 --> 36:06.240
they lead

36:06.240 --> 36:08.240
to a certain correction

36:08.240 --> 36:10.240
of the money flows.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.240
Dependency leads

36:12.240 --> 36:14.240
to the fact that you must take into account

36:14.240 --> 36:16.240
the consequences

36:16.240 --> 36:18.240
that occurred

36:18.240 --> 36:20.240
with a dependent project

36:20.240 --> 36:22.240
in the chosen project.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.240
We can draw a line on this.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.240
I hope that

36:26.240 --> 36:28.240
you will solve

36:28.640 --> 36:30.640
all the tasks

36:30.640 --> 36:32.640
in the workbook

36:32.640 --> 36:34.640
based on these tasks.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.640
They are not difficult.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.640
I would like to draw your attention

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
to the fact that

36:40.640 --> 36:42.640
sometimes

36:42.640 --> 36:44.640
it is written

36:44.640 --> 36:46.640
in a different way

36:46.640 --> 36:48.640
so that you

36:48.640 --> 36:50.640
think about

36:50.640 --> 36:52.640
what this parameter means.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
But all the tasks

36:54.640 --> 36:56.640
are not difficult.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
Finally,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
the last two tasks

37:01.040 --> 37:03.040
in the workbook

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
are a summary

37:05.040 --> 37:07.040
of real situations

37:07.040 --> 37:09.040
where such

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
investigations were carried out.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.040
You solve them.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.040
The last task

37:15.040 --> 37:17.040
is a small case.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.040
Your task is to recheck

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
the investment project

37:21.040 --> 37:23.040
that was laid out there.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.040
The project is not difficult.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
It is a very popular business

37:27.440 --> 37:29.440
in the village of Podmoskovye.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
There is NPV,

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
there is IRR,

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
there are many things.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
Your task is

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
to recheck

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
these calculated data

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
taking into account the objective realities

37:43.440 --> 37:45.440
that exist on the market today

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
and to draw a conclusion

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
on how the project is calculated

37:49.440 --> 37:51.440
correctly and whether it is worth

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
doing it or not.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
That's all.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
Thank you for your attention.
