WEBVTT

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.250
Good afternoon, dear colleagues.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.110
I am Oleg Bakstansky, a professor

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.930
at the Plekhanov Russian Academy

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.510
of Economics.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.230
At the Plekhanov Academy, I teach MBA courses

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.770
on the topics of human resources management,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.690
organizational management,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.610
and the sociology of organizations.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.430
Today we are going to talk about

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.490
the science of organizational behavior.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.910
To a large extent this is a new discipline,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.470
everyone has already encountered

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.130
it, and in the day-to-day activities

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.030
of your organisation we do something,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.330
we undertake something,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.810
we succeed in something,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.950
we agree with something, we disagree

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.930
with something.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.070
This or that production

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.490
conflicts arise, this or that

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.290
action.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.110
That is, organizational behavior

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.330
is what surrounds us,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.430
surrounds us in our constant

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.590
daily work activities.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.710
Naturally, the problem

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.790
of organizational behavior

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.830
is quite an interesting and

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.390
extensive field of study.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.870
And researchers pay quite a

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.510
lot of attention to this section.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.610
As always, we can notice that organizational

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.990
behavior as a scientific

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.130
discipline has developed

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.370
abroad.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.890
And it was only at the end of the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.670
1990s that it gradually began to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450
receive realization, to attract

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.970
interest and to be present in

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.770
studies of domestic specialists,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.190
or even more accurately,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.970
domestic employers, firm owners

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.830
and businessmen came to the conclusion

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.570
that in order to raise the quality

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.550
of business, to improve their

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.470
business indicators and business

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.510
results, it was necessary to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.370
use those developments that already

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.190
exist in this science, in order

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.270
to be able to respond to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.510
the demands that are placed

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.430
on business, and to have the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.830
opportunity in some or

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.630
other of the above-mentioned

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.630
fields of study.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.530
We will study different aspects

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.470
of this discipline later on.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.970
And today we will talk with you about

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.070
how the science of organization,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.070
as the science of organizational

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.850
behavior, arose, how it has

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.550
developed, what its roots are,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.470
what its related specialties

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.890
are, what its connections are,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.130
and, accordingly, what it does

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.670
and what its usefulness is.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.650
The first question before

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.270
us is, of course, what organizational

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.810
behavior is.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.790
Here's the definition of the discipline,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.930
because if we know the definition,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.210
then it's pretty much

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.170
already clear what

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.590
this science is going to do.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.490
As for definitions, there is no

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.190
unambiguous solution here either,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.750
because there are many different

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.090
approaches, many authoritative

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.030
sources.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.190
And, accordingly, each school sees

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.030
and studies the problems of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.570
organizational behavior in its own way.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.430
Since our task is to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.910
get a general idea of what

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.070
organizational behavior

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.070
is, we will not go into

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.950
all sorts of arguments

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430
about the nuances that

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.070
arise in the study of

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.670
human behavior in organizations.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.310
We will settle with you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.790
on a neutral definition, which

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.730
is very general, but at the same

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.390
time it covers all those aspects

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.170
that arise in the study of human

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.850
behavior in an organization.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.950
And then, as we become

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.350
more familiar with the discipline,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.290
we will go deeper and deeper into

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.210
it, respectively, and look

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.890
at all sorts of facets that

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.630
arise in this situation.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.690
So, organizational behavior can

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.270
be defined as a certain area of

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.710
knowledge about how people behave

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.790
while in this or that organization,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.150
and how the behavior of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.190
people in this organization

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.150
affects, determines,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.470
predetermines the results

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.670
of this organization.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.250
Organizational behavior has

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.630
been considered by many

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.910
studies, but perhaps one of the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.590
first most authoritative textbooks

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.750
on organizational behavior was

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.930
written by Francis Lutens, and

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.910
accordingly Lutens followed

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.350
a similar definition, in fact

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.110
he was the first to give such

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.910
a definition, and Lutens

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.550
believed that organizational

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.490
behavior is the science of

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.670
describing, explaining, predicting,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.150
managing human behavior

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.410
in organizations.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.310
What we need to point out

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.270
right away is that organizational

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.810
behavior is a science.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.890
Which is inherent in

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.590
its own metalogical apparatus, which

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.970
we will talk to you about next.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.430
Which is inherent in its

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.030
terminology, which is inherent in

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.010
its tradition.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.650
And, accordingly, as any scientific

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.950
discipline, organizational

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.290
behavior must describe human

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.950
behavior in an organization,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.830
explain human behavior in

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.250
an organization.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.230
That is, to find out

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.150
those regularities, those laws that

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.110
govern that behavior, and to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.110
predict how the person will behave

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.510
later in the organization,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.350
how he will fit into the role,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.110
into the mission of that organization,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.330
how he will contribute

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.470
to the fulfillment of certain

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.610
tasks, what he will do

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.530
in the organization.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.050
Will he really be that necessary

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.270
part, that necessary

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.410
element that will contribute

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.230
to the objectives of

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.890
the company.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.650
Either he will be engaged in

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.770
either sabotage or he will

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.850
be neutral to the functional

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.730
responsibilities that are

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.530
entrusted to him.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.750
It's essentially the same loyalty

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.530
problem that you have in a commercial

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.370
organization all the time.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.770
So now let's try to look at

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.630
what disciplines of organizational

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.070
behavior interact with,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.950
what results it uses, and,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.270
accordingly, what general

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.250
principles, general

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.650
ideas, general concepts

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.270
it applies.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.230
If we look at the totality

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.630
of social sciences, which are

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.070
to some extent related to human

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.170
behavior in an organization,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.630
then first of all, of course,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.890
we can single out the so-

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.350
called social sciences, social

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.030
disciplines, which study

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.430
how the social environment,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.710
society, society affects

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.750
the individual, determines

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.030
his behavior.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.530
Among the social sciences that

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.730
we can see on the slide, first

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.710
of all, of course, general

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.370
psychology can be mentioned

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.770
because in any organization,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.890
there are always living people

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.010
with their emotions, their

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.010
cognitive cognitive mechanisms,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.030
their affects, conflicts,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.630
aggression, various

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.390
desires, various feelings.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.230


00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.150
And as far as the human being is

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.870
concerned, every living person is first

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.210
of all a certain subjective formation.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.730
He thinks first of all not about his

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.650
work, but about the problems that

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.790
surround him, about the tasks

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.450
he needs to solve.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.210
He thinks about the fact that he has quarreled

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.050
with someone, that he has quarreled with

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.150
someone, that he needs to pay back certain

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.710
debts, to do certain things.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.110
And in this connection, his work

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.070
is only one part of his life.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.870
This is why quite a lot of material has

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.450
already been accumulated in psychology,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.990
which makes it possible to analyze and

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.230
understand different aspects of human behavior.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.570
And, of course, organizational

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.450
behavior to a very large extent,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.990
takes results from the

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.590
economics that exists in general

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.230
psychology.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.130
But at the same time, it should

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.490
be noted that psychology itself

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.030
is a vast science, and it will

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.790
concentrate its attention on

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.190
different kinds of human activity

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.470
and behavior.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.450
Psychology highlights such a large

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.130
section as social psychology.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.670
What is social psychology

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.370
is a discipline that studies

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.630
human behavior in society, how

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.330
the human environment affects

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.870
individual human behavior, and

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.730
how a person changes the behavior

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.850
of the group in which

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.870
they are in.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.130
What concerns social psychology,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.410
this discipline has been around

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.050
for about two centuries,

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.610
and here again there are various

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.090
kinds of patterns, approaches

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.950
that allow us to describe

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.210
to some degree both human

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.850
behavior and the impact

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.630
of other people

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.070
on a person.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.230
To understand what social roles

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.950
a person performs as a husband, a

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.870
boss, a subordinate, what social

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.990
functions he performs, what social

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.290
expectations are placed on him, what

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.570
social roles he can play, and

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.310
why a person seeks to occupy these

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.910
or those social roles, what

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.970
opportunities they give him.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.330
And in this regard just this is a very

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.390
important section of the

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.230
same organizational behavior, because

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.850
what is a person's behavior in an organization?

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.890
We spend at least one third of

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.550
our lives at work.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.710
And in this connection we

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.270
go to work not only to receive

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.890
money and provide our comfortable

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.630
life in the surrounding

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.610
society.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.230
We go to work to gain prestige,

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.370
to win the attention

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.370
of others.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.330
We go to work in order to build

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.770
a certain career ladder, we set

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.270
ourselves certain limits in order

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.230
to receive a new assignment,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.350
in order to realize ourselves,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.410
to find our field of applicability,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.870
to realize certain

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.070
abilities.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.350
Each of you who have come today

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.770
to hear about organizational

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.770
behavior has enough of your

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.770
own experience of working in

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.870
different organizations.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.550
He knows perfectly well what he wants, how

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.150
he wants it.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.770
But nevertheless, you want to

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.110
acquire new knowledge.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
Again, knowing that this

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.250
new knowledge, new skills

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.210
will go a long way toward

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.870
making you more successful,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.530
more empowered at your

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.110
job, more successful at

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.510
the functional tasks

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.790
that you face.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.550
Tasks of management, tasks

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.670
of functioning, tasks of solving

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.870
these or those issues related

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.250
to your daily activities.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.410
And accordingly, again, each

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.050
of you wants further career growth,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.510
further promotion, because this,

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.810
on the one hand, is an increase

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.990
of your welfare, on the other

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.370
hand, this is an assessment

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.570
of the achievements that

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.450
you have made.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.810
Any person is very much interested

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.250
in the fact that those actions that

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.670
he does, will be appreciated.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.410
Because if we do something and

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.810
we don't get appropriate feedback,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.070
we lose motivation in that

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:10.790
regard.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.330
Why do we need to do

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.710
something and make this or that

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.610
effort if no one notices it

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.270
anyway?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.610
This whole area of activity is

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.970
what is being studied,

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.210
analyzed, considered in social

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.310
psychology, and the relevant

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.710
knowledge is very much in

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.020
demand with regard to the

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.330
analysis and study of organizational

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.650
behavior.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.750
In addition to social psychology,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.130
psychology also deals with

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.750
such a section as work

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.810
psychology.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.650
It has different names.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.210
Engineering psychology,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.830
environmental psychology,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.070
industrial-organizational psychology.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.130
It all depends on tradition.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.290
In Russian tradition, this is

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.430
labor psychology.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.770
In the foreign tradition, there is no

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.890
such concept.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.250
Then all of the issues that are addressed

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.430
by this discipline fall under the

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.770
category

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.570
of industrial-organizational psychology.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.210
How a person works, what

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.730
conditions contribute to the

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.490
quality of his work, what conditions

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.410
have a negative impact on

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.250
this work, how to furnish

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.150
the workplace for a person to

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.190
be successful in its functions,

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.890
what helps and what hinders,

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.010
how to arrange the tables?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.390
What distance should a person have

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.450
from the computer?

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.350
How many people can be in

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.230
one room?

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.330
How do you favorably arrange people?

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.070
Everyone has his own isolated

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.610
room, or a modern office

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.650
style, when everyone is in sight

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.590
of each other.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.770
There are pros, there are cons.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.790
And these are all issues

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.590
that are considered

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.770
in work psychology,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.990
because they greatly

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.070
influence and affect the

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.970
results that arise from

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.350
your functioning.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.890
Beyond that, of great importance in

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.110
human relations psychology, and of

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.250
course, of great importance to a

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.790
proper understanding of organizational

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.850
behavior, is the ethics of

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.110
relationships.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.510
People interact with each

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.430
other, and they interact

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.590
with each other according

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.470
to certain rules.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.290
There are written rules, various

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.890
kinds of laws, requirements,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.330
instructions which are prescribed,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.270
which we read, which

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.330
we get acquainted with, sign for.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.490
There are unwritten rules.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.150
And unwritten, so-called

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.490
informal norms of communication

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.390
often play a much more important

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.830
role than written ones.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.110
For informal relationships, this

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.250
is the relationship that arises

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.930
in the team between people.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.130
After all, spending 8-10-12 hours

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.450
at work, who knows how, we are

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.630
not spending this time in

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.730
a vacuum, we are interacting

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.710
with other people, we are giving

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.550
them orders, we are getting the

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.250
information we need for

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.330
our future work.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.030
And in this context it's

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.330
very important to build a relationship

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.570
with these people, how easy

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.510
and fast you will get the data

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.470
you need, how complete

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.070
the data will be, how formal

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.710
the data will be.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.470
It all depends on what kind of

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.810
informal contacts, informal relationships

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.390
we have in place.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.970
This is something that belongs

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:46.010
to the field of ethics, and usually

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.170
we don't pay much attention to

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.070
it, we very rarely focus our

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.950
thought on how we treat

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.770
others, how others treat us.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.670
We usually take it for granted.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.490
But nevertheless, it is worth noting

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.090
that here is the ethnic gradation

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.130
of relationships, it is the essential

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.510
point that either contributes

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.210
to the fact that we are happy

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.250
to come to work, or largely

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.830
hinders our performance, our

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.730
work, let us say, we do

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.670
not want to go to work in

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.510
the morning, and we go there

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.850
because we have to.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.470
And naturally, we need to

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.570
hurry to finish our work hours

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.970
and leave the collective, the

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.570
society where we don't like to be.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.390
Naturally, this attitude

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.730
has a rather negative

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.950
impact on the results

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.870
that we get.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.030
Very close to this row of

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.830
attitudes is such a discipline as

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.810
cultural studies.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.410
Of course, ethics and cultural

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.890
studies are quite related, because

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.470
cultural studies are those or

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.450
other cultural norms that we

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.250
carry out.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.450
But then again, you can go to work

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.330
in different ways.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.790
If it's hot outside, you can

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.690
come to work in a T-shirt, in shorts.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.250
But this, of course, will

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.570
to a large extent not coincide

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.410
with those or other corporate

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.050
norms of behaviour, ways

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.110
of behaving, corporate perceptions.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.850
Corporate perceptions are also

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.070
the embodiment of a certain

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.250
social culture.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.170
If you work in a bank, if you work for

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.030
a prestigious insurance company,

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.450
they have their own style of dress

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.670
which you have to follow

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.390
regardless of whether it's convenient

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.230
or uncomfortable for you.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.570
But there are certain norms

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.910
and you have to follow

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.370
these norms, it is useless

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.810
to ask why they are like that.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.550
They are like that because

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.310
in this organization they are,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.550
and if you want to be in this

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.110
organization, if you want to

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.570
develop in this organization,

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.230
if you want your career prospects

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.590
to grow in this organization,

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.690
you have to accept the culture

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.330
that is in this organization,

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.590
and not try to change

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.110
it.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.610
The culture is built up over

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.090
a long period of time, and it's

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.690
not easy to change, either.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.550
It's quite a bone structure.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.170
People change, bosses change,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.150
the buildings where the same organization

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.610
is located change, but the people

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.990
who work in that organization

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.870
remain.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.710
And these people, they are the

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.690
carriers of those beloved cultural norms.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.730
In terms of the social sciences,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.950
we have looked at such elements

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.210
as general psychology, social

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.910
psychology, work psychology,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.290
ethico-culturalism.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.250
Naturally, we could also

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.230
talk about other social disciplines,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.650
but it so happens that it is these

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.710
approaches that have the most

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.410
significant impact on organizational

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.650
behavior.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.090
It is these disciplines that have accumulated

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.690
the necessary volume of facts,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.110
the necessary regularities that

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.050
are used in the analysis of organizational

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.670
behavior and prove useful

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.590
for its understanding, for its

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.650
changes, for its correction, for

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.930
its modification.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.510
This is what concerns the social

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.730
disciplines that are directly

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.530
related to organizational behavior.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.970
Another discipline that also

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.390
has an impact on organizational

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.130
behavior is management

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.890
psychology.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.050
Here is what concerns management psychology,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.410
in fact, of course, it also belongs

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.730
to psychology, but because

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.490
of its importance, because

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.170
of its importance, because of its

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.790
tradition, it is singled out as

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.350
a separate direction, because any

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.030
organization is first of all

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.130
a hierarchy.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.170
It is a hierarchy, in which there are different

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.030
levels of approaches, different levels

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.170
of connections.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.010
Connections of one level are

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.890
horizontal hierarchy, connections of different

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.650
levels are vertical hierarchy, connections

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.690
of subordination, connections of management.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.490
And since the entire organization

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.290
is people, this structure is

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.590
primarily held together by

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.170
psychological relationships.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.550
So the discipline of management

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.310
psychology is a very important element

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.710
that is studied in many courses,

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.110
including MBI courses, and,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.350
accordingly, when we talk about

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.550
organizational behavior,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.230
it is very important for

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.030
us to keep in mind those

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.330
patterns that work on organizational

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.290
management.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.190
How management is done, whether it's

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.990
authoritarian, and, accordingly, it doesn't

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.570
matter what you think, it doesn't matter

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.630
what you think.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.610
You have been told what to do and how

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.410
to do it, and your initiative is irrelevant here.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.330
You have to do what you are told.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.350
That's one approach.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.430
And these are approaches that

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.050
exist, including in many successful

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.630
organizations.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.810
Moreover, with regard

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.510
to the authoritarian approach,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.170
this is the approach that is

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.530
often very present in domestic

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.570
organizations.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.490
And later on, we will talk about

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.770
this again in more detail.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.330
There are other types of

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.250
management which take into account

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.370
your interests, your initiative.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.010
Moreover, tasks are set for you, and

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.130
then you start to solve this task.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.110
And you are not told how

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.610
to solve it.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.310
This is your choice, your capabilities.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.230
This also belongs to a democratic

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.590
style of management which

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.290
also delegates the

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.030
responsibility for various

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.610
acts you perform.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.670
There are other styles of management.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.570
And, as you understand, naturally,

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.410
organizational behavior will

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.690
be largely determined

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.270
by that management style,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.030
by those psychological patterns

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.230
that will be present in terms

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.230
of management, that

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.270
are present in this organization,

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.370
and it is the psychological

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.030
basis of management that will

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.990
largely shape the organizational

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.630
behavior that exists

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.230
in the organization.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.350
In any organization there

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.090
are the managers, the top

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.510
managers and the managed, those

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.190
own executives who work in that

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.970
organization, who have their

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.590
own section of executive

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.130
activity and who are responsible

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.710
for that section.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.110
Naturally, these people, ordinary

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.890
employees, line workers, have

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.610
little chance, little

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.050
opportunity to influence

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.750
the entire organization

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.010
as such, simply because

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.970
their field of activity

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.530
is a very small area.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.290
And so they are embedded here in this

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.850
system of hierarchy in the structures,

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:01.910
hierarchies that exist in the organization,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.790
And they perform only those actions that

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:11.970
are required to be performed according

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.450
to the business plan of the company,

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.690
according to the organizational

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.750
structure of the company,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.610
according to that management

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.310
style that exists in the company.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.690
In this regard, in addition to management

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.750
psychology, a discipline such as sociology

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.250
of organization is of great

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.410
importance for analyzing organizational

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.550
behavior, for its understanding,

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.630
for its systematization.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.310
Sociology is a science that deals

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.290
with the analysis of the social

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.330
aspects of human behavior.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.150
But this is no longer an analysis of human

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.110
behavior as psychology, subjective

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.670
analyses of a person's desires,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.330
motives, emotions, that is, what comes

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.310
from the individual.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.950
Sociology comes from the group

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.450
a person is in, and, in fact, sociology

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.330
studies those tasks, patterns,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.450
requirements that

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.790
the group places on the

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.790
individual.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.290
Sociology is not interested, unlike

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.430
psychology, in what you think about

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.150
the organization, what your emotions

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.610
are, what your experiences are.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.950
Sociology is only interested

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.670
in the external, or what are called

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.890
objective regularities

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.730
that the organization you

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.710
find yourself in imposes

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.570
on you.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.850
In the later parts of our course,

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:34.930
we'll just be looking

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.530
at research methodology,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.090
and psychological approaches,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.730
and sociological approaches.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.650
For now, it is important for us to understand

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.310
this very difference, that the sociology

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.070
of an organization is essentially

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.610
a list of the rigid requirements that

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.050
the organization imposes on you as

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.730
a member of that organization.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.370
You chose the organization, you

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.290
came to work for it, but since

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.390
you chose it, you have to obey

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.170
those patterns, those corporate

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.070
ethics, that corporate culture,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.390
those corporate norms, that

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.090
corporate hierarchy that exists

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.730
in that organization.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.270
And consequently, depending on how

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.250
these relations are built,

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.130
the norms of organizational behavior

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.130
will change, the freedom of

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.430
those actions that you are allowed

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.110
to take, the degree of activity

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.490
that you are allowed to

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.430
be involved in.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.200
The next block of disciplines that

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.380
is very closely connected

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.100
to organizational behavior is

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.220
managerial science.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.820
What you see on the slide.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.440
Again, what the management sciences

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.040
are concerned with is the field of management.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.440
Naturally, we've talked to you about

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.780
this many times before, but as far

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.860
as management is concerned, there

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.540
are also several disciplines that

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.060
approach management from different

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.140
perspectives.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.780
And naturally, each of these

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.620
perspectives has its own impact,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.500
its own impact on organizational

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.680
behavior.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.480
First of all, of course, is management

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.520
itself, the general science

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.760
of management.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.080
What management styles exist in an

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.960
organization?

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.980
How does delegation of authority,

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.940
delegation of responsibility take place?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.360
Who takes responsibility for the

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.020
decision being made?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.920
Who takes responsibility for implementing

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.560
those decisions?

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.360
What is the degree of freedom, this

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.780
is the backlash that the employee

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.240
has in the degree of solving his problems?

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.180
How can he be subordinate?

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.940
What co-subordination exists.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.320
These are all things that are addressed

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.220
in management courses, and what

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.660
you and I will look at further

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.800
in our course.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.580
The next discipline that plays

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.440
an important, even in a sense,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.240
also a determining influence

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.640
on organizational behavior

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.760
is, of course, marketing.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.440
The study and analysis of the market.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.020
For all those market laws that

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.880
are known in marketing are naturally

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.660
at work in organizational

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.560
behavior.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.920
This market is not an abstraction.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.580
The market is the action of the people

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.780
who are on this market, the action

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.460
of an organization which has

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.320
either a different or a different

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:28.620
market.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.900
All those laws on the promotion

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.000
of goods, services which are known in

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.420
marketing, they naturally find

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.720
their manifestation and realization

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.640
in organizational behavior.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.620
For it is precisely those people

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.820
when they are in the organization,

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.700
They also function, according to

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.800
these or those laws.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.540
And the organization either achieves

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.880
certain heights on the market,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.340
develops new niches, displaces competitors,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.820
produces new products, or,

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.900
as they say, the organization

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.280
gradually comes to naught, the

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.020
death of the organization

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.820
occurs, its disbanding, absorption,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.600
and another organization with

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.520
new laws of organizational

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.380
behavior, with new ethics,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.060
with a new culture, new regularities,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.040
new opportunities emerges.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.120
The organization, again, does not exist

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.860
in a vacuum.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.740
Well this is what I have already talked about,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.260
which again, I want to draw your attention to.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.880
An organization always exists

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.860
alongside other organizations.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.700
People who are in one organization

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.800
act and function together

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.380
with people who are in

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.180
other organizations.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.820
And this, too, is organizational behavior.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.820
And here, too, are those marketing

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.340
regularities that need to be considered

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.840
and taken into account.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.080
We have talked mostly about management

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.240
and marketing, about these sciences

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.760
of management.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.720
But I constantly emphasize, I constantly

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.700
speak about the fact that the

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.000
organization is people.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.980
So people are the staff of the organization.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.040
In this regard, when we talk about

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.600
organizational behavior or when

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.780
we talk about organization, of

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.360
course, it's imperative

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.220
to talk about a discipline

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.980
like human resource management.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.280
What human resource management

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.580
is about, it covers the whole range

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.460
of issues related to human

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.180
performance in an organization.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.080
Personnel selection.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.280
If a person, some organization starts

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.760
to work, he was found, he turned

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.620
out to meet the requirements,

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.700
those competencies that

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.760
are required for the

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.180
position he occupies.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.780
And consequently, the person

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.660
was employed by that organization,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.560
and then he begins to function

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.900
in that organization.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.520
He begins to behave in

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.660
this organization in a certain way.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.520
He behaves according to the requirements

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.780
that are imposed on him.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.980
Behave in accordance with the function

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.600
that functions and operates.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.640
And, accordingly, the selection

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.720
of personnel is the first

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.460
task that arises here for any

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.340
person who begins to work somewhere.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.840
A person works in an organization, and

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.360
here, of course, you have to pay attention

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.140
as a training and development

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.100
of the person who is in the organization.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.600
If you're good at something,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.180
if you're a successful manager,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.300
then naturally the organization

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.800
is interested in improving,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.120
developing, focusing

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.820
those skills that are useful

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.700
to you, adding those skills

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.740
that you lack.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:33.120
Building a career ladder, a

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.160
career learning structure are

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.240
all things that hunt too to this area.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.860
In addition to developmental training, the

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.980
same organization will be in the business

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.320
of evaluating and motivating the person as an employee.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.860
You can be put in the talent pool,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.760
you can depend on that assessment,

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.880
on the evaluations that you get

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.900
in the organization, in

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.300
terms of solving certain tasks,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.380
in terms of the assessments,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.080
it determines that level of achievement,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.920
that level of development that

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.320
you're going to have in

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.420
that particular organization.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.600
That's the whole area that

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.580
goes into human resource management.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.880
Well at the end of the day, we don't usually

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.880
talk about it, but it's the same personnel

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.420
business of production.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.640
Sick days, vacations, business trips,

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.540
this is all organizational behavior, too.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.980
Modern organizations

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.160
are quite mobile and mobile.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.540
And a person can be sent on a business

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.300
trip, a person can fall ill.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.160
All this, again, requires those

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.320
or other documentary forms.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.300
And then, each of us, coming

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.940
to work, presents a

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.860
resume.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.900
A resume is in a certain way

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.800
somehow confirmed your labor,

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.700
personnel successes that

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.220
you had.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.100
This is all something that belongs to the field

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.280
of human resources management.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.900
And when we talk about aggressive behavior,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.680
then personnel management

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.060
is, perhaps, to the greatest extent

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.500
with all of its regularities,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.180
with all of its possibilities,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.140
incorporated into this organizational

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.480
behavior.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.580
Very often there is even a dispute

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.820
between specialists in HR and specialists

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.860
in organizational behavior,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.260
that in fact the HR-function

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.660
is the same organizational

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.200
behavior, and therefore one more

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.380
discipline does not make sense.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.220
But due to the fact that we have

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.040
already talked about the links

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.940
of organizational behavior with various

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.320
social disciplines, we can still

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.680
see that these very links, which

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.580
arise with a large complex of psychological,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.640
managerial, sociological,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.480
organizational problems, testify

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.340
to the fact that organizational

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.820
behavior in its tasks,

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.620
goals and solved problems

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.780
is much broader

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.700
than personnel management.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.860
Moreover, we can even say that

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.380
the field of HR, it is largely

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.360
included in organizational

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.680
behavior.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.500
In modern management, there

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.600
is such a concept as organization

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.600
theory.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.540
After all, the same organizations come

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.480
in different forms.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.880
An industrial organization,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.360
a service organization, organizations

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.540
that are related to the performance

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.220
of certain functions.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.760
There are different types of organizations.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.400
And naturally, each of these organizations,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.680
if it has a different type, a different

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.860
scope, has its own organizational

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.940
behavior, its own goals,

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.640
its own tasks, its own approaches.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.540


00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.340
And of course if we want to understand,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.740
to analyze the organizational

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.120
behavior that emerges in this

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.660
or that sphere, it is essential for

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.120
us to understand what kind

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.720
of organization a person

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.480
is in, what kind of organizations

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.900
we are talking about.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.400
Again I draw your attention, it makes

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.760
no sense to talk about organizations

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.080
in general, about the market in general.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.680
Organizational behavior is a

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.680
significant specific discipline.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.800
It deals with the analysis of the behavior

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.920
of concrete living people in this or

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.020
that organization.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.820
It applies the general scientific

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.240
laws that have been discovered in

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.940
this or that field to the analysis

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.280
of human actions in the

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.840
organization where he is.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.980
Again, there are many managerial

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.620
sciences, and we talked about management,

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.060
marketing, personnel management,

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.620
organization theory, just

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.320
as in the analysis of the social

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.660
branch, these are far from

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.520
all sciences, but traditionally

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.060
it so happened that organizational

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.580
behavior is largely

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.220
based on them.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.620
The only other thing that is important

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.360
to mention, and to which one should pay

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.800
attention, is the area of innovation

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.620
management, which is currently developing

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.300
very strongly and successfully.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.020
Naturally, as far as innovations

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.280
are concerned, they came to us

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.180
from the Western tradition, because,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.300
after all, business there is

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.560
much more actively developed and

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.600
on much higher quality

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.880
aspects than in Russia, and

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.120
I think there is nothing surprising

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.960
in that.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.600
So, as for the Western

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.620
management, they paid attention

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.500
to the fact that a great number

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.700
of modern organizations,

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.460
huge investments are

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.320
made in innovations.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.000
It is significantly connected with the

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.560
development of information structures, with

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.380
the development of computer structures,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.200
with the development of virtual

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.300
organizations, which we will

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.780
talk about later.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.480
So innovations, they just imply

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.200
the process of constant changes.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.780
It used to be that there was an organization,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.400
you came to this organization,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.280
you worked in it until you retired,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.080
and nothing changed.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.900
That was characteristic of

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.080
the 1960s, 1970s, even 1980s,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.220
when there were quite certain

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.400
norms and attitudes in organizations

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.020
that practically

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.280
didn't change.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.380
People were changing, but the

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.780
functions were the same.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.080
Today we live in an era of

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.380
constant change.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.460
New commercial areas are emerging,

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.020
new areas of business are emerging.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.180
And, accordingly, a different

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.800
number of innovations are constantly

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.640
being introduced, which must

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.880
be applied if you want to defend

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.160
your market niche, at least, or

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.920
expand that niche accordingly.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.340
It is in this connection that different

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.640
innovative enterprises and venture

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.240
companies are being developed

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.700
more and more.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.580
Today no one can say which

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.340
sphere, which part of the

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.180
market will largely prevail

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.080
tomorrow.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.880
Analysts are fighting over it, but

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.720
if everything were that simple,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.180
we would not be witnesses

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.560
of constant innovations, which arise.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.700
Constant creation of new

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.580
structures, new organizations,

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.160
new approaches, new

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:23.840
tasks.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.100
That's why great importance

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.440
is now given to innovations

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.480
in the same management.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.980
And from the whole management as a

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.040
theory of management,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.220
the Innovation management as

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.040
the management of innovations,

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.140
management of those new

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.200
alternatives, new approaches, new

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.000
elaborations, which exist, stood out.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.060
Today the one who was the

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.020
first who was able to develop

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.220
any innovative idea, he wins,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.600
he is ahead of competitors,

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.320
he makes profit.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.840
Innovation management is

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.080
very risky management.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.520
But if you realized this risk, if

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.260
this risk is realized, then

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.020
accordingly you get a very

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.980
good return, a very good

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.580
return on your investment.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.100
Of course, if we talk about

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.840
risky behavior, it puts very

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.060
strict requirements on the

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.860
behavior of those people who

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.340
are in organizations.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.440
You now have to know that either the

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.100
organization in question, and hence

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.880
you in that organization, will be successful

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.720
and get results, profit and so on,

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.060
or the organization will be

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.500
forced, will go bankrupt, and of

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.140
course this will also affect your

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.640
development, your career to a

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.640
large extent.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.260
So these innovations now have

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.580
a very, very strong influence

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.760
on organizational behavior

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.360
and they are a very good indicator

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.900
of how progressive that

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.640
behavior is, organizational

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.800
behavior or how

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.320
stable, standard,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.360
schematic it is.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.340
Modern organizational behavior

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.080
and modern management require

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.760
a departure from the

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.040
old, time-proven, schema.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.620
Today if you want to succeed in

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.120
business you have to be able to take risks.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.440
And so there are certain criteria,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.920
certain requirements which are

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.460
imposed on you, on the person

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.680
who is in the organization

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.420
and behaves in a certain way

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.740
in that organization.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.960
We have now looked at those basic

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.800
scientific disciplines, those basic

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.520
industries that have a direct

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.100
output, a direct impact, a

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.240
direct impact on organizational

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.320
behavior.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:58.860
Again, I want to say that, of

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.980
course, you can name others as well.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.620
And, of course, depending on who's

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.280
in what field, the disciplines

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.300
that I've named

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.620
may be present here.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.280
A lot of it has to do with IT technology.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.900
Again, it has to do with telecommunications.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.860
So these are the disciplines that

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.380
are developing right now.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.700
But if you refer to

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.200
organizational behavior as a kind

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.520
of already existing scientific

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.560
discipline, then you and I have just

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.980
looked at the main points with

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.980
which it is connected, with other

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.160
sciences, the advances that it

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.040
uses, the results of which it takes,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.380
the laws of which have

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.280
to be considered in order

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.600
to organize effective organizational

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.340
behavior within the organization

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.060
that exists.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.300
Again, it is immediately apparent

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.600
that organizational behavior is a fundamentally

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.340
interdisciplinary field of

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.120
knowledge.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.960
It is pointless to argue here which

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.140
is more important, the general psychological

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.340
pattern or the marketing pattern,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.680
or, on the contrary, only on innovation

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.140
management because of its importance

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.540
at the present moment.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.060
If we want to have a comprehensive,

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.280
holistic understanding of human behavior

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.560
in an organization, the functioning

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.800
of the organization itself,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.820
we need to take into account at

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.100
least all of these disciplines,

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.340
all of the results that we

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.340
have already talked about.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.960
On the one hand, this interdisciplinarity

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.000
is a very progressive

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.560
element; on the other hand,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.180
it leads to the fact that researchers

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.300
are usually fixed on one

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.760
aspect, and so it turns

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.580
out that their analysis of implementation

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.140
behavior goes in this

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.020
or that key.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.460
This is especially common in Western

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.640
studies as well as in Russian ones.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.100
There are now a large number

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.800
of textbooks, including those that

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.520
are recommended to you, you have

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.640
received the appropriate materials,

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.500
but still we must keep in mind that

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.780
each textbook is written by one

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.880
or another author, or a team

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.780
of authors who are more successful

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.580
in a particular direction.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.620
In this regard, of all the

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.860
textbooks that exist,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.460
there are some classic ones.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.080
In particular, this is a textbook by

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.940
Francis Lutens on organizational behavior.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.020
It really is a classic.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.420
And if you want to know how

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.640
organizational behavior

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.860
was formed, why it lasted,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.980
and to know the general approaches

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.660
that exist to it, you

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.560
have to go to it.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.100
But it's a textbook, after all, that came

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.220
out 20 years ago.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.980
Of course, it will not be able to reflect

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.160
all the innovations, so here we need

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.660
to insert already more modern

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.680
textbooks, but again, remember

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.000
it is the fundamental interdisciplinarity

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.420
of organizational

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.180
behavior, and, accordingly,

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.560
do not try to look for answers

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.080
to your questions only in one

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.060
or another discipline.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.900
Let us now briefly review the

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.200
history of the discipline of

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.400
organizational behavior.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.400
Surprisingly enough,

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.580
organizational behavior has

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.720
a history of over 100 years.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.980
The first studies of organizational behavior,

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.920
not yet naturally so named, began

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.420
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.900
centuries.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.040
This was largely due to the

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.400
fact that there was industrial

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.200
growth, new factories, plants,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.800
a stage of industrial development,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.340
the end of the nineteenth

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.600
century.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.540
And, accordingly, a great

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.620
number of people were included

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.420
in this industrial production.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.620
Of course, at that time,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.480
a person's job was to stand

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.640
at a machine, or you stood

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.140
at some other mechanism,

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.040
and your task was

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.620
to reproduce these

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.560
or those actions,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.600
to make the mechanism

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.440
work.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.260
The fact that the end of the XIX century,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.560
and in general the formation of industrial

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.500
production was largely associated

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.320
with advances in technology, mechanics.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.760
New machines, new devices, new

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.840
machines were created, which

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.920
were connected both with the

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.880
gasoline engine, and with

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.680
the internal combustion

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.920
engine, as they developed

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.880
further, and in this situation,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.800
man was regarded as a principal

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.100
adjunct to this mechanism.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.820


00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.860
Here is a very important approach.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.140
In principle, it was with this

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.620
approach, or rather, not agreeing with

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.040
it, that the analysis of

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.160
organizational behavior began.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.040
The end of the 19th century, the industrial

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.700
revolution, the development of those either on

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.460
their production, but the factories, and the main

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.320
influence, the main importance in them was

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.340
given precisely to devices, precisely to mechanisms,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.120
precisely to machinery.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.100
Man was not simply a service

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.060
mechanism; he was seen

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.620
as the same part of technology.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.300


00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.440
And if machinery was

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.920
reliable, well-equipped,

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.080
invested in, then man was

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.920
the weakest part of

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.140
technical progress.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.080
He got tired, he made mistakes, he

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.980
had to be interrupted, he had

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.360
to be fed, he had to be trained.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.920
After all, that man could break

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.420
an expensive machine.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.280
And if that or our tank cost a

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.460
lot of money and had to be

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.360
bought, the man could always be

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.580
easily replaced.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.220
If you can't work, then it wasn't

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.480
a question of if you wanted to.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.900
If you can't work, I'll find

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.240
someone who can work and put

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.360
him on that machine.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.980
If he makes mistakes, I will

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.380
change him and find someone else

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.860
who makes fewer mistakes, and so on.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.560
That's the situation that arose.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.440
In this case it was a question of

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.200
the man being a traitor to the machine.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.080
And that was the prevailing view of

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.820
the late nineteenth century, early

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.560
twentieth century.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:54.730
It is worth mentioning here such

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.030
a man as Frederick Winslot Taylor.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.930
The thing about Taylor is that he

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.610
was just thinking about this question.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.670
What is man's place in this

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.850
industrial production?

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.670
Is man really

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:17.950
just a certain trait

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.850
to operate the machine.

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.410
Taylor began to investigate the behavior

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:28.190
of the workers, at the time he had

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.650
no problem because no one was asking

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.590
for these workers' consent, their wishes,

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.850
and yes, let's just say he wasn't

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.650
really distracting them, he was just

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.110
observing how they worked, when

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.510
they made mistakes, when they

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.410
began to get tired.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.070
He was the process of working, he was the observer.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.890
And, accordingly, Taylor drew

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.130
attention to the fact that the

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:58.830
person working on the machine

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.930
was not such an

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.550
auxiliary element.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.730
Moreover, he observed that

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.310
the success, the efficiency

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:11.210
of any particular machine,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.550
any particular mechanism,

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:18.590
depends largely on how

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.050
the man works with that machine.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.110
How he likes to work, how he dislikes

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.010
to work.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.130
How motivated he is to work with that

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:29.850
machine.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.270
In addition, Taylor drew attention

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.290
to another aspect.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.110
Depending on what kind of

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.470
workload on a person, how much

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.910
time he works, the number

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.010
of errors increases.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.350
And, accordingly, just by purely

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.510
empirical way he drew attention

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.030
to the fact that if a person works a

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.390
certain amount of time, I'll

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.990
replace him with another person,

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:01.870
so that the first one has a rest,

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:06.370
then the number of errors decreases,

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.470
as long as the person has

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.170
an opportunity to rest.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.110
The person, as they call it, takes a breather.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.530
And after he goes

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:19.050
back to work on his machine,

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.190
his mechanism,

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.230
his productivity increases.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.250
And then Taylor simply began

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.810
to make all sorts of experiments,

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.010
in order to grasp how much

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.870
time it is desirable for a

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.590
man to work in order not

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.650
to commit all sorts of mistakes.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.330
Those studies that Taylor conducted,

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.410
and let only he published them,

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.430
got the name, and now widely

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:52.650
known, as the scientific

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.330
organization of work.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.030
And with the name of Frederick Taylor is

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.390
precisely the creation of this concept

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.190
of scientific organization of labor.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:02.970
This concept has already proceeded

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:07.630
from the premise that man cannot

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.250
and should not be viewed simply as

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.850
a traitor to some system.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.330
It is not a traitor, it is a defining

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.410
element, a defining mechanism,

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.170
whose functioning largely

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.650
determines the efficiency,

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.810
the quantitative output that

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.670
results from the work of

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.570
this or that machine.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.300
Taylor proposed a number of effective

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.800
measures which helped to

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.480
increase labor productivity.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.920
Naturally, he faced the same

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.740
problem.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.080
There is a machine, there is

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.180
a man working on that machine, but

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.720
he was interested, and he was not so

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.960
much interested in making the man

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.000
work well, he was interested in a

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.580
pure business problem.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.660
The machine can produce, roughly

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.660
speaking, 100 parts.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.780
Because of the fact that there is a man

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.440
working on the machine, who gets tired,

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.900
out of these 100 parts you get 20, 30,

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.580
40 rejects.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.860
So the machine produces

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.200
60 parts.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.040
How do you make sure that

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.080
the capacity of the machine, these

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.980
100 parts, they were 100 parts

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.960
in a working day?

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.360
That's the question Taylor was solving,

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.420
and in this connection he came

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:28.220
to the conclusion, in order for a machine

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.320
tool to work at its full

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.020
efficiency, it is necessary

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.780
to provide a person working on this

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.020
machine with certain working

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:36.740
conditions.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.580
It was Taylor the First who introduced

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.080
such a procedure called timekeeping.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.360
He stood with a stopwatch and measured

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.440
how much time passed, until the

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.420
man began to get tired, how much

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.820
time it took a person to perform

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.780
one operation, another operation,

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.160
a third operation, how easily

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.100
a person could switch

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.460
to perform these or those

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.640
operations.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.380
And, of course, a person did not work

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.600
alone, because if we take a

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.880
manufactory, there were several machines.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.500
Each successive one worked on a part

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.060
that had been made by the previous one.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.680
And here again a situation

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.080
arose which is also very often

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.720
found in modern factories.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.040
There were very many pieces,

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.260
excess of them, which could

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.940
not be processed on other

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.800
machines.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.360
There were more complicated operations,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.040
more time was required for machining,

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.980
and, accordingly, the problem

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.200
arose of an overabundance of some

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:42.440
parts and a shortage of other parts.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.700
As a result, the production schedule was

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.320
not followed, and the machines worked at

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.740
odds with each other.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.900
It was the introduction

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.460
of timing that made it

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.780
possible to synchronize

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.700
production of one

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.640
part or another.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.620
After all, it was possible to take

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:09.100
different numbers of machines so that

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.200
all parts were in continuous production.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.900
There was no assembly line yet, but it

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.560
was thanks to Taylor that timekeeping,

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.740
the timing of working hours,

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.380
was first spoken of.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.620
In fact, it was this timekeeping

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.300
that was the precursor to later

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.700
assembly-line production.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.320
But, of course, Taylor did

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.660
not limit himself to timekeeping.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.620
This is his idea of timekeeping, which,

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.160
among other things, has its development

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.380
today in what are known as

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.920
photographs of working time, photographs

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.380
of the workplace.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.980
When it is written down by the time

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.700
stage of the employee's performance

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.680
of this or that activity during his

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.300
working day, during those or other

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.380
tasks that he is solving,

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.360
all this comes from Taylor.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.120
But the same Taylor drew attention

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.000
to another aspect.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.360
In order for a worker to work effectively

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.220
on this or that machine, he

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.640
must understand what to do.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.080
That is, roughly speaking, which button

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.200
to push, when to push it,

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.180
and, accordingly, how hard to push it.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.680
It was Taylor who drew attention

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.740
to the fact that, in fact.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.560
It is precisely because the worker

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.420
does not quite understand the technique

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.900
of the machine mechanism, the machine control,

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.480
that a large number of defects occur.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.460
What is experience according to Taylor?

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.660
According to Taylor, experience is that

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.240
an experienced worker already knows

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.060
where to stand, which side to stand on,

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.100
how to hold the part, and

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.060
therefore he will not commit

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.400
a huge number of defects.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:55.580
As a result, Taylor initiated

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.380
the creation of so-

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.640
called instruction cards.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.440
Cards that had written instructions,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.820
step by step, step-by-step instructions

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.600
of what to do, how, when,

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.300
and in what order.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.960
And, accordingly, when a new worker

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.180
came to work on this or that

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.120
machine, he would study

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.360
those instructions beforehand.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.220
Again, today we know very well,

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.380
and it persists.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.340
It's essentially a safety technique.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.820
Just as now we sign for safety

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.860
procedures, though we sign without

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.220
reading them, so back then

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.400
the worker studied the

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.560
instruction card.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.200
And if now, after you studied it,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.740
after you asked all the questions,

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.180
after you understood what to do,

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.100
you did the defect, then it was your

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:49.620
own fault, and, accordingly,

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.600
you were fined and sanctioned.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.460
And you yourself understood that

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.700
it was really your fault, because you

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.920
didn't comply with something, you did

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.860
something in the wrong way, or in some other way.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.060
So the instructional cards that

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.780
Taylor introduced, they, again,

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.000
still have this or that existence today.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.200
And not without reason, when you buy

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.060
any complex device, a computer, a camera,

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.740
a video camera, to Taylor, he always

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:16.340
has an instruction card for the activity.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.280
This, again, is something that goes back to

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.220
Taylor by the late 19th century.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.640
The same Taylor drew attention

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.980
to the following fact.

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.020
Machines are different,

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:35.180
and naturally, when a worker

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.960
works on the same machine, eventually

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.580
he gets bored with that machine.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.960
It is because man is not

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.180
a machine that the same

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.600
Taylor pointed out.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.900
The fact is that man constantly wants

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.740
some kind of novelty.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.900
And so, if you learned to work

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.660
well on one machine, the factory

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.020
owners used to leave you

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.080
on that machine.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.680
Why would he take someone else, you're already

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.100
successfully working on that machine,

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:05.060
you already know what to do and how

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.440
to do it.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.220
But Taylor pointed out that if

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.560
you work very long hours, you lose

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.080
interest in working on that

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:11.600
machine.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.920
Your attention dulls, and you start

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.180
getting defective again.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.740
That's such a protoxic situation.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.060
If you don't know how to do it, understandably,

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.580
you're learning, so it's a marriage,

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.240
but you already know everything,

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.680
you do everything with your

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.940
eyes closed, and you still get

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.380
a marriage.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.520
And it was Traylor who formulated

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.280
the problem as worker retraining.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:40.840
And, of course, back then psychology

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.580
wasn't as developed and there weren't

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.680
the terms that there are now.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.680
And, of course, Taylor wasn't

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.620
talking about any career development,

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.580
but the idea was simple, and the

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.700
idea was the same as building

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.260
a modern career tree.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.760
You've successfully learned to work

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.620
on one machine, but you

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.880
AND naturally want to develop further.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.920
If only because working on

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.800
another machine pays more.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.940
If only a material incentive.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.400
Taylor had only material incentives.

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.240
Taylor did not offer non-material

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.640
incentives at that time.

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.560
Although, a little later on, the

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.640
rudiments of non-material

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.720
incentives were also suggested by Taylor.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.200
Correspondingly, you want to move

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.680
to another machine, you will have

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.500
renewed interest, you will have

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.560
renewed concentration.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.320
And so the same retraining

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.100
that you do, it can be successful

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.740
because it will be

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.400
an incentive to your

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.220
work.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.000
Once you've mastered one machine, you

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.440
can move on to the next machine.

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.780
And if a worker knew that he had

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.200
a job prospect, that if a

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.380
machine was replaced, it didn't

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.800
mean that you'd be out the factory

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.300
gates and you'd be mastering

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.180
another machine.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.500
It was in his best interest, and his

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.080
motivation to work increased.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.060
When Taylor proposed the idea

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.240
of retraining, it was not

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.540
received with enthusiasm,

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.280
naturally, because retraining

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.200
is, again, an investment.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:23.660
But then it turned out, and the

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.840
factory owners, the shipyard

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.000
owners saw this, that this change

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.540
in attitude to the workers, it would

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.260
be very effective in maximizing

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.400
the efficiency of the equipment

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.920
with which they worked.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.380
Taylor drew attention again to the

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.360
next step, that when the work

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.740
takes place in this factory, in the

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.240
manufactory, then another very

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.840
important structural element

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.740
has to be included, the planning

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.580
bureau.

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.780
The work shouldn't go like this, you've

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.340
got so many parts, you've got so many

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.780
parts, and then we'll figure it out from there.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.520
The work must be planned.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.520
There has to be a plan of how many

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.740
parts, how many blanks to make.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.280
It must be planned how many of these

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.240
or that kind of part after

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.020
each machine to be able to plan what,

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.060
the amount of work during the working

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.180
day, how many pieces will

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.220
be made, how efficient these

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.040
pieces will be, what the relationship

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.720
should be between the delivery

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.800
of new pieces and the dispatch

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.240
of finished results,

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.640
and so on.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.460
Work planning is again associated with

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:43.180
the name of Taylor, and in fact just

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.220
very often it is planning

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.700
that is often cited as one of

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.840
his most important accomplishments.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.820
Although, of course, it is pointless

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.160
to argue which of these elements

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.800
seemed more or less important.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.100
Today we, again, understand very

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.280
well that all of the things we

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.960
are talking about are used in

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.980
the daily activities of any company.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.700
But in addition to planning these

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.340
objective indicators, Taylor pointed

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.880
out that the social condition

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.420
of workers also plays a role

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.080
in the quality of work.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.720
If a worker knows that his children

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.120
are looked after while he is working,

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.540
then, accordingly, his thoughts

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.440
will not be scattered to something

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.300
else, and he will be able

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.320
to concentrate all his efforts

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.780
directly on work.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.760
So, as I said, although Taylor

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.860
did not deal directly

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.280
with the intangible stimulus,

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.440
the ideas were laid out here.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.020
Taylor emphasized that if we

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.540
engage in collecting socially

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:00.440
meaningful information about that

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.220
particular worker, about

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.220
that particular social

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.860
group, and promote meaningful

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.940
social needs of the worker,

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.100
then he will perform better.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.960
Naturally, this idea was later applied

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.800
very widely, especially in the

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.160
next stage of the development

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.300
of organizational research,

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.040
which we will discuss

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.200
a little later.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.180
In addition to these measures,

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.180
which, in fact, constituted the scientific

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.480
organization of labor, Taylor was one of

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.240
the first to explain scientifically

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.980
such a phenomenon, characteristic of

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.820
industrial production at the end

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.240
of the XIX century, as restrictionism.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.460
The point is that workers had certain

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.480
standards of production.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.880
And, naturally, the workers

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.020
were interested in keeping these

01:02:59.020 --> 01:02:59.720
norms low.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.540
That is, they deliberately

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.300
limited the output of certain

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.720
products, always finding a lot

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.600
of objective reasons.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.540
Taylor was just pointing out

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.680
that if we provide timing, instruction

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.180
cards, work scheduling,

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.180
then we will have the data

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.380
to say that we can actually increase

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.980
the rate of production here,

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.400
and this increase will

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.540
be absolutely correct and

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.620
not be a further exploitation

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.800
of the survival

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.940
of the runoff

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.940
workers.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.320
And if we provide social support

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.600
for the worker, as it is now called,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.240
then in gratitude for the

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.820
fact that the owner cares not

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.480
only about his profits,

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480
but also about his family and

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.460
his children, he will be interested

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.960
in working better and producing

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.840
more.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.800
In this way, the problem

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.400
of restrictionism, which confronted

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.520
industry in the late 19th century,

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.220
which had been battled over

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.460
in various ways, was solved scientifically.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.040


01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.500
Moreover, when he substantiated

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.460
all this, and when, accordingly,

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.980
appropriate measures were taken,

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.080
the principles of scientific

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.700
organization of labor he proposed

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.300
were introduced, then indeed

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.080
the phenomenon of restrictionism

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.360
gradually began to come

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:31.900
down.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.880
Well of course, within certain limits,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.900
but nevertheless this problem was

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.540
also deprived by Taylor.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.100
Again, Taylor had followers,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.060
there were predecessors,

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.060
but here are the results that

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.940
were obtained at this time, they

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.920
led to the creation of the

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.360
classical model of organization,

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.960
and accordingly the classical

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.020
model of organizational

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.040
behavior, which was developed

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.340
and created by Henri

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.780
Fayle.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.960
Again, of course, it was not only

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.020
Fayele who had a hand in this,

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.020
but in his works it was well structured,

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.780
and accordingly, the classical

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.500
model of organization,

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.580
it correlates with

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.920
Henri Fayele.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.360
As far as Fayele and as far as the classical

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.760
model is concerned, there are

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.060
four principled approaches that

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.280
have characterized organizational

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.620
behavior in the late 19th,

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.220
early 20th century.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.880
First of all, the first

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.320
point is that there was a rigid

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.360
division of labor.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.240
The worker worked on the same

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.880
machine, the work on the same machine.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.960
Some workers handled parts,

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.500
others handled them, others

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.040
did other work, and still

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.940
others carried parts.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.980
But the main thing here was that there was

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.080
a narrow specialization.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.860
Everyone had to do a certain

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.200
part, a certain element

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.160
in the work.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.640
To a large extent this was precisely

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.000
what came into play under the influence

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.440
of Taylor's scientific organization

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.260
of labor.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.660
The second important element

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.640
of the classical model is that there

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.440
are certain commands and

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.540
orders that are passed from the

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.100
top down, and only from the

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.860
top down.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.200
There is a supervisor who knows what

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.000
you have to do, how you have to do

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.180
it, when you have to do it.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.840
If you succeed, if you fail, that's

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.620
your problem.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.240
You have to fulfill those prescriptions,

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.680
you have to fulfill those functions

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.180
that are assigned to you,

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.860
that are passed down to you.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.900
In this connection, the third point of

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.760
the classical model, the one-man rule,

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.560
the existence of a single commander,

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.340
was very important.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.700
This consensus was called

01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.880
one boss.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.580
The simple fact is that

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.600
if more than one boss

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.060
appears, they can often

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.240
give different orders.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.560
And that will introduce a certain amount of confusion.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560
I'll always cite, that boss

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.440
told me to do this, and you told me

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.360
to do the other thing now,

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.480
so you figure out amongst yourselves

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.480
who's going to do what.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.060
I got the instruction, I did.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.000
Well, which instruction was more important,

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.420
that's not my problem, as they say.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.500
The commands come from the top.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.560
And in this way it turned out that

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.040
the worker was not interested in improvement,

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.560
in optimization of work and labor.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.120
And another important

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.040
element of the classical

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.800
model of organizational

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.840
behavior was the so-called range

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.940
of control.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.160
There was a limited number of

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.960
subordinates of a given leader.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.760
And, accordingly, even if the actions

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.340
of those subordinates overlapped

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.100
with the actions of other workers, you,

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:06.060
as the leader of those particular

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:07.640
subordinates, had no right to interfere

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.780
with the work of those who were

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.560
not within your sphere of influence.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.060
It was a rigid mechanical model.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.640
One leader, this leader's subordinates,

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.560
a rigidly circumscribed sphere

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.640
of your interests, a rigidly

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.040
circumscribed sphere of your

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.480
enterprise, where you work

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.600
and where you do things.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.840
Naturally, this model of

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.700
gradational behavior was very rigid

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.940
and did not allow for any backlash

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.540
from the executive.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.120
There are instructions, there is work.

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.560
As far as the managers were concerned,

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.360
there was also a rigid hierarchy,

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.080
and this rigid hierarchy led to

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.840
the fact that everyone knew what

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.800
to do, and everyone knew what he

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.920
was responsible for.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.700
It was always possible to identify

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.360
at what element and at what stage a

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.180
failure occurred, and to find the culprit,

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.020
who could be punished.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.480
This rigid hierarchy, it introduced

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.660
the function that professionals

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.200
had to work in every field,

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.520
and it was always possible to find

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.980
out who made the mistake that caused

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.040
the defect in the overall work.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.660
In principle, as far as this

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.880
model is concerned, this model

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.960
of research existed somewhere,

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.580
well, perhaps until

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.980
the 1920s.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.360
And it was only in the 1920s that

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.080
this model became necessary, not even

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.720
in the sense that it was

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.440
necessary, but it became clear

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.080
that this model had exhausted itself.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.860
Naturally, to a great extent this

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.280
happened due to the fact that production

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.720
was developing, science

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.940
was developing, new equipment

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.660
was appearing, new machines

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.400
were appearing, new aggregates

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.040
were appearing, and more and

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.820
more workers were stuck to

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.160
maintaining one machine.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.040
So the problem was that

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.140
this maintenance required

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.500
a lot of initiative.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.140


01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.140
And it was initiative that would

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.120
not be rigidly declared, simply

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.020
because sometimes a worker with

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.220
extensive experience on certain

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.800
kinds of machines might be

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.760
more competent than the

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.980
supervisor above him, who

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.960
was giving him instructions.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.400
The worker might know that if a

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.640
given machine worked at the same

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.840
load, at the same speed, then after

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.440
a while the cutter would go bad, the

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.820
chisel would break or the worker

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.600
knew this from his own experience,

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.240
but of course nobody listened to

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.580
him simply because he was the

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.000
worker and it was the supervisor.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.580
As the equipment became more and

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.020
more complex, as more and more

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.200
new equipment appeared, as more

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.120
and more new connections emerged,

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.840
as industry developed, as industry

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.980
developed, the problem

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.760
arose that the classical model

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.500
of organizational behavior, which

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:19.960
had been introduced, which had

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.160
been substantiated, which

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.760
had been cradled by Taylor,

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.880
by Fayol, by other authorities,

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.880
needed at least a modification.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.240


01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.960
And, as always,

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.700
a significant contributor to

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.080
this modification was, again, the

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.660
scientific experiments that were conducted

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.660
in the late '20s, respectively, formally

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.320
they lasted from 1927 to 1932,

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.040
these experiments that were

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.460
conducted in the town

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.640
of Hawthorne at the Western

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.740
Digital plant.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.460
Usually these experiments, now

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.320
called the Hawthorne experiments,

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.600
are associated with

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.140
the name of Elton Mayo.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.820
But in fact, a whole group

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.680
of authors were involved in this

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.780
experiment.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.760
Which included Fries, Rettlisberger,

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.460
Elton Mayo, William, Dixon, and others.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.680
When these experiments were

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.860
carried out, the main idea

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.740
that came out of them was that

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.340
in addition to these objective characteristics,

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.240
which must be taken into account,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.700
which are considered in the

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.880
classical model, it is necessary

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.940
to take into account informal

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.420
relationships, informal

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.300
ways of organizing within

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.700
work teams.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160
And if the organizational behavior

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.760
of the classical period, of the

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.400
Taylor period, it was still

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.500
formal organizational behavior,

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.880
it was necessary to identify

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.420
those modes of action that

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.140
exist, that hierarchy of

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:10.900
relationships that exist.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.440
That hierarchy of commands, that function

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.480
of authority that exists, and you

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.140
were not to deviate in any

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.160
way from those characteristics.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.340
The Hatonn experiments drew

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.800
attention to the fact that

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.040
the informal attitude,

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.420
the informal interaction of people

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.980
in the whole team has a very

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.960
significant impact on

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.660
the end result.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.860
Again, there was nothing new

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.020
here, because, as you and I just

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.680
mentioned, Taylor had already

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.980
drawn attention to this, but

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.000
Taylor just didn't emphasize it.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.940
The main thing for Taylor, after all, was

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:54.320
to formalize this or that relationship.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.260
That's right, up to the 1920s,

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.460
up to the 20-30s this is the

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.840
classical Fayol model that

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.200
we've been talking about.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:20.120
But in 1927 in Hawthorne, the owners

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.460
of the Western Digital

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.200
plant were interested in

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.320
how to increase the productivity of

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.380
their workers.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.340
As far as the workers were concerned,

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.580
they were mostly women.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.580
The plant, basically the engine, was

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.060
in the business of assembling electric rolls.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.060
As for assembling the roles, it

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.840
was a rather pedantic and

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.560
meticulous job, because the role

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.360
had certain elements that had

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.540
to be connected in a certain

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.500
way, put together, and the

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.020
role itself included about

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.300
13 elements.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.320
Naturally, the person who was

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.360
assembling the trillet

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.200
gradually got tired, he had

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.260
mistakes, and, accordingly,

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.280
the final trillet was

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.640
defective.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.540
Again the same old task

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.540
arose.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.120
I need a certain amount

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.820
of trillet output, and

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.660
I get a lot of rejects.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.220
How to get rid of this scrap?

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.540
All previously carried out approaches

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.460
of classical model, Taylor, Fayol,

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:36.060
they gave a certain result,

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.180
but nevertheless, this result

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.000
alone did not suit the owners

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.700
of the plant.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.760
And accordingly, the owners

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.740
turned to Rettlisberger, Mayo

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.300
Dixon to the scientists in order

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:56.500
to explain, give their

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.260
recommendations on how to reduce

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.180
the number of defects

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.260
and increase labor

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.300
productivity.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.780
Mayo approached the matter, again,

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.620
from an experimental point of view.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.320
A group of female

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.420
workers was assigned

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.500
to collect this role.

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.780
They were put in a separate room,

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.700
and then they began to experiment on them.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.100
And what concerns this experiment,

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.140
the experiments were, shall

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:36.080
we say, quite extensive.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.340
We, his staff, monitored completely

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.100
the behavior of the girls during

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.880
the workday, what they did,

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.400
how they did it, when they interrupted,

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.380
when they ate lunch.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.840
They monitored what they ate, how

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:56.720
they ate.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:59.400
What's more, later on we widened

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.200
the scope of interest and began

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.000
to wonder what girls do outside

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.260
of work hours, even to the point

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.560
of measuring, as ridiculous as

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.220
it is, girls' sleeping hours, how

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.280
much they sleep, and how much

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.040
of this sleeping time is

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.380
significant in terms of mistakes,

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.760
in terms of marriage.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.620
How much time do girls have to work

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.200
so that marriage doesn't show up?

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.060
How often do they need to take these or

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.980
those breaks?

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.260
Naturally, initially Rhett Lisberger,

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.560
May Dixon, they went in the

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.720
vein of Taylor and just did

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.140
timing, made instruction

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.360
cards, enumerated

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.860
operations, engaged

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.000
in teaching girls behavior.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.920
And then they began to analyze the

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.280
external conditions of work, what

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.440
a little later Heisberger would

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.940
call the hygienic factors of work.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.120
They were interested in what the

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.380
lighting should be, what the noise

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.400
level should be, what kind of

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.140
room the girls should be in,

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.760
how far apart they should sit,

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.240
how far they should stretch

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.780
to get the finished piece, how

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.680
tired they were from this, and

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.040
so on.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.240
We studied lighting conditions,

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.560
time-work conditions,

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:40.260
lunch-break conditions,

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.780
time conditions, how long

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.960
it took to pick up

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.460
a tool, pick up a part,

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.380
and so on.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.660
Accordingly, it was these external

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.620
factors that were changing, and

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.940
Mayo and the authors noticed

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.020
that some change corresponded

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.560
to an increase in productivity,

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.960
some worsened it.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.060
These were factors related to

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.160
production, what Taylor was doing.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.520
And then Rettlisberger, Mayo, and

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.960
Dixon decided to introduce these very

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.680
social elements.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:26.420
The girls began to receive meals from the

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.460
factory, that is, they no longer

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.520
brought food with them as they had

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.000
done before.

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.720
They started getting hot

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.920
meals, hot lunches.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.460
During the breaks they received buns,

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.480
milk, something else.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.720
And they did not get it at their own expense,

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.700
it was at the employer's expense.

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.660
Accordingly, if a girl was

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.640
tired, she could interrupt her work,

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.820
rest, not according to the

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.080
time you were supposed

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.320
to, for example, two hours of

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.920
work, 10 minutes to rest.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.480
Here you feel like you're tired now.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.680
You interrupt, have a little

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.180
rest, and then continue your

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:06.780
work.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.860
That is, gradually, they allowed the

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.440
subjective needs of the girls to manifest

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.640
themselves, that is, they themselves

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.320
regulate these or other conditions

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.220
of work.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.780
And the researchers noticed that

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.320
productivity has increased

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.560
dramatically.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.060
The researchers conducted everything

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:28.720
as it should be.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.240
There was a group of girls

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.560
or an experimental group they

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.300
worked on.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.280
There was a control group that was

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.300
working under normal conditions

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.740
for that Western Digital plant, assembling

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.240
the same relays.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.440
And naturally, the researchers

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.700
noticed that productivity began

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.760
to increase dramatically.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.440
It was a dramatic increase.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.460
Naturally, this was reflected,

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:53.620
especially, again, note, these

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.980
experiments lasted 5 years,

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.320
and as for those 5 years, it

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.920
was quite a difficult time

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.760
for America, it was the

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.480
time of the Great Depression.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.560
And yet, all the same, money was given

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.020
to Litwinningram and her to

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.020
allocate the experiments.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.120
So, the researchers noticed,

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.220
productivity, the more attentive

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.260
you were to the female workers,

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.720
the more interested you were

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.280
in their work, their

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.980
productivity increased.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.140
And then the researchers, after looking

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:40.020
at ways to increase labor productivity,

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.420
asked themselves a second question.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:45.140
Now how do we reduce these

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:45.900
costs?

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.460
And they started slowly depriving the

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.140
girls of what they were used to.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:22:00.900
Lunch, buns, reduced rest time,

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.300
reduced lighting conditions,

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.060
increased the noise conditions,

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.100
because, of course, it

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.020
was a specific task, set

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.520
by the owners, to find

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.640
the best conditions.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.600
That's what they were doing.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.720
And here the most interesting

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.060
paradox happened.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.660
The girls who were, shall we say, used

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.360
to paradisiacal working conditions.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.160
They were paradisiacal compared

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.020
to how other female workers in the

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.480
same factory worked.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.960
After all these conditions

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.220
began to be abolished,

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.000
labor productivity

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.920
hardly dropped.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.020
Now this was a completely incomprehensible thing.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.940
It went completely against

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.720
the classics, the same Taylor

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.940
Fayolly had a huge amount

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.240
of evidence that if I change

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.460
the working conditions,

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.360
it affects productivity.

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.980
There was a clear deterioration

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.920
in working conditions,

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.960
and yet productivity hardly dropped.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.940
Moreover, well, let's just say, maybe

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.480
from an ethical point of view, those

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.180
experiments that Red Lisbergellar, Mayo

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.480
Dixon produced would be criticized

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.340
now because they were, I should say,

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.640
so unethical, but let's just

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.540
say that first the girls are promoted

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.920
to good things and then they

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.060
start depriving them of that.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.520
But then Mayo did get

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.260
interested, and until when can I

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.080
worsen these conditions of

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.540
labor so that the productivity

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:43.080
of labor It does fall, because

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:43.980
he got interested again.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.700
According to the classical model, they

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.000
should be falling, but they're not.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.300
He had already started to make them significantly worse.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.600
The girls were working almost in semi-darkness.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.640
Naturally, this had a negative

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.360
effect on their vision.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.840
It was going down, but her productivity

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.560
was not going down significantly.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.220
She was in this group of girls who

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.960
were already working in conditions

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.700
worse than other workers in the

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.120
factory, almost in semi-darkness.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.100
Naturally, this was not the case in the factory.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.460
The productivity of this

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.780
group was still higher than

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:18.820
that of the girls in the

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.660
control group.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.560
Well, naturally, the researchers were interested.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.520
So what's going on?

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.260
They were interested in everything

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.660
naturally from a scientific point of view.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.820
After all, this was a refutation

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.880
of the paradigm, the paradigm of classical

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.800
labor organization.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.760
And these were facts from which there

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.720
was no escaping.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.180
The girls who were used to working

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.960
in semi-darkness, who were used to working

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.360
in perfect light, noise was added, other

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.700
disturbances were added.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.140
Work productivity was still

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:47.600
higher.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.620
Yes, it certainly dropped

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.840
compared to what these same girls

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.620
had before.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.960
But it still didn't drop

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.760
so much that the girls could

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.720
be fired and therefore

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.780
recruited.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.520
Rürth Lisberger, Mayu Dixon,

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.620
and the others next I worked

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.040
with wondered what the

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.460
reason was.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.020
Naturally, they were interested in this

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.720
from a scientific point of view, and it

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.660
was then that they turned their

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.920
attention to what might be keeping

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.840
the girls in these already hellish

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.280
working conditions.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.600
And, since Mayo and Dixon were

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.640
psychologists, they suddenly

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.320
noticed that girls tend

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.440
to stick together, they

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.380
are interested in being

01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.640
with each other.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.120
Yes, and working conditions worsened,

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.700
yes, the lighting worsened, but

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:54.520
it was interesting for them to

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.320
talk to each other during this work,

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.300
it was interesting for them to

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.220
criticize and scold these bad

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.820
researchers, because of whom

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.180
we lose our eyesight.

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.340
They had an inner understanding,

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.360
an inner unity.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.760
They formed a kind of

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.020
close-knit group.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.620
This situation was completely unexpected

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.320
and ran completely counter to the

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:22.940
classics.

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.460
It turned out that all these external conditions,

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.760
of course, they are important, but, nevertheless,

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:31.040
they are not the only ones.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.080
In addition to them, there is another factor.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.740
The factor of human relations,

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.160
or this informal attitude.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.660
These are all the things we talked

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.980
about, about the ethics of relations in

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.720
the beginning, about the culture of relations.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.420
And this factor, this factor

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.220
of informal relations that exist

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.600
within the group is so

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.500
important and so strong that

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.480
it is able to suppress all

01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.680
external objective negatives.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.820
And we based it on... What

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.660
concerns the Hutter

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.260
experiments, a great number

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.180
of results were formed on their basis.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.540
They gave rise to the development

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.280
of all of social psychology,

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.660
all of industrial-organizational

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.040
psychology, all of those

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.520
very disciplines that

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.560
we spoke about at the

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.660
very beginning.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.720
It was Mayo who formulated the

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.340
doctrine of human relations on the

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.540
basis of these experiments.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.340
He was the first to formulate this

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.860
doctrine in management, in

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.000
the manager as such.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.460
What Mayo did was to point

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:43.520
out that in addition to all

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.380
those points that are very

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.780
well covered in the classical

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.560
model, we should also consider

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.800
such an element as these

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.240
subjective human essence,

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.260
these human relations.

01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.600


01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.980
Because these human relations

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.180
have no less of an influence

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.140
on the result of production

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.900
than all the objective factors.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.200
What concerns the doctrine of

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.600
human relations, at first it was not

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.880
accepted, a lot of business owners

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.780
were against it, because they

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.460
thought it was just another blasphemy

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.200
of scientists, whose goal was to

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.340
conduct this or that research, and,

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:32.500
accordingly, they were not

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:37.240
interested in commerce itself,

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.080
they were interested in their own

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:39.920
interests.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.460
But what concerns Majori, Lisberg,

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.620
Dixon, their followers,

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.020
their collaborators, they showed

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:51.940
that it is possible to treat their

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:54.680
ideas, these informal relations,

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.500
and the doctrine of human relations

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.080
itself in different ways.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.380
However, if you take it into account,

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.880
there is a sharp increase

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.260
in labor productivity.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.360
This has been proven

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.320
experimentally, and there is no getting

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.260
away from it.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.000
As far as businessmen are concerned,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.100
they are people of facts, and

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.820
when they are shown the facts, they

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.560
accept them.

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.520
What is the doctrine

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.620
of human relations, as it

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.100
was formulated by mine, as

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100
it was formulated by

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.440
my followers, and, accordingly,

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.580
as it is formulated

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.860
now.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.700
The main fact is that man

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:40.420
is a full-fledged and equally

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.680
important element of production.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.640
And if we want to understand, to

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:50.300
understand why production functions

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.380
successfully or unsuccessfully, why

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.980
we are either ahead of our

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.580
competitors or not ahead of them,

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.080
we must take this very human factor

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.480
into account.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.720
There is a lot of talk about

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.020
this now, but the very notion

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.480
of the human factor, in fact, was

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.800
introduced by her inspiration

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.900
of human relations.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.820
It came from the fact

01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.560
that man is a social being.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.620
Again, this was obvious to

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.520
him, being a psychologist, he

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.400
naturally knew this.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.660
But the important thing was that

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.440
as a social being, man is oriented

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:27.020
toward other people, and his organizational

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:30.080
behavior, that is, his work,

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.640
his behavior in the organization,

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.460
is included in the context

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.460
of group behavior.

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.220
If we want to understand how a person

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.160
works, we must first of all study

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.920
the group of people in which he

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.860
is located.

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.200
This is the group

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.380
of his immediate environment or the

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.780
primary group.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.100
After her, the massive study

01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.660
of primary groups began.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.640
There are many researchers here,

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.280
for example, Charles Cooley, other authors.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.580
But the main factor from our point of

01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.660
view, from the point of view of the

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:10.020
pattern of behavior, was that a person's

01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.660
behavior in an organization

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:15.420
is not determined by his individual

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.180
psychological characteristics alone,

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.360
but is determined by the behavior

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.440
of the group in which he is

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.340
included.

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.580
We have drawn attention to the fact that

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.100
the behavior of the individual as such and the

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.200
behavior of the individual in the group are

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.000
two great differences, as they are called.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.580
And, therefore, if we are looking

01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.500
at organizational behavior, which

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.620
is the behavior of large groups

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.140
of people engaged in an organization,

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.820
then we need to study not only

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.480
and not so much the behavior

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.360
of a single person, what Taylor

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.420
was doing, in fact, what

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.460
Fayol was talking about.

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.180
We must first look at group behavior,

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:52.460
group norms, group values, and it

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:55.060
is these group norms and values,

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.580
they are precisely then that

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.340
will be accepted by the individual,

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.240
perceived, and will be realized

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.480
by his behavior.

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:06.960
Not his norms and values, which is very

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.020
important, but the group norms and values.

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.160
The correlation of individual

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.220
norms and group values

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:13.580
is a separate problem that

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.100
exists in social psychology.

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.520
Many regularities have

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.800
been found out there, and, naturally,

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.260
the theory of organizational behavior

01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:22.920
studies and takes these regularities.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.720
This is the area that is taken

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.240
from social psychology in

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.600
the theory of aggressive behavior.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:33.960
But this is the first and important

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.760
aspect when the emphasis is placed

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.960
first on human relations,

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.540
the human factor, and then on the

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:40.500
group factor.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.360
The next thing that Mayow drew attention

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.040
to with his doctrine of human relations

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.280
is that, and this again was obtained

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.220
experimentally during his

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.860
Hatong experiments, human nature

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.360
appears to be incompatible

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.500
with the rigid hierarchy

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:01.000
and bureaucracy of subordination

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.260
that is found in organizations.

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:04.440


01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.260
Man can be forced to perform

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:12.020
certain actions,

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:16.360
certain factors, but he

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.220
will tend not to do them,

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.120
and he will consciously

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.060
sabotage certain actions,

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.640
which will manifest

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.660
itself in marriage, affecting

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:33.300
labor productivity and

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.200
the effects that arise

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.400
here.
