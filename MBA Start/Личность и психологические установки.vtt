WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I am the Director of the Department of Leadership and Personal Effectiveness of the Moscow Business School.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
I am a teacher and have 20 years of experience in business education.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
I have been a manager for 10 years in consulting, investment and insurance companies.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Today we will look at the organizational behavior course,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
which is a very important part of the course.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Today we will look at the organizational behavior course,

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
the topic of personality and psychological institutions.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
Personality and psychological institutions are topics that have interested psychologists, philosophers, sociologists

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
and all people who are interested in the organization of the soul of a person for centuries.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
That is why there are countless theories of the description of a person's personality and psychological institutions.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
It is clear that within the framework of our video course,

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
we cannot cover all possible theories and approaches to studying a person.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes, there is no need for this.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Our task is to get acquainted with some approaches to studying a person's personality.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
And the most important thing is how to apply knowledge about a person's personality and psychological institutions in business.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
Thus, our main tasks that we will solve during the course of the course of personality and psychological institutions will be as follows.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
We will get acquainted with the main types of personality theory.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
We will also get acquainted with the concept of personality in the theories of Freud, Jung and Bern,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
on the basis of which the typology of the personality Myers-Briggs was created.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
We will also consider how the typology of the personality of MBTI is applied today in the organization.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
We will also consider the self-perception of feedback and the window of Johari, which is well known in business.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
First, let's define what a personality is.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
A personality is a combination of stable physical and psychological characteristics that allow an individual to identify himself in society.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Chiadaev said quite correctly at one time that without the opportunity to communicate with people,

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
we would simply pinch the grass and not think about the subtleties of a person's mental structure.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
After all, a person's personality affects society in the same way as society affects a person's personality.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
We can talk about a person's personality and psychological institutions only by looking at them in the socium.

02:42.000 --> 02:53.000
The main types of personality theory presented on this slide give you a description of three approaches.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
Psychodynamic theories explain the dynamics of a personality based on the interaction of structural elements of the psyche,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
unconscious attractions, fears and complexes.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
The followers of the psychodynamic theory of personality study were, for example, Freud and Jung.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Sociodynamic theories.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
The leading role in the development of the psyche is given to the social conditions of the existence of a personality and its social environment.

03:24.000 --> 03:40.000
And, accordingly, interactionist theories, where the psychosomatic structure of a person's personality and the socium in which a person is located affect the dynamics of a personality.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Psychodynamic theories.

03:48.000 --> 03:59.000
Today we will look at the main approach of psychodynamic theories, as I said, the followers of which were Freud and Jung.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
So, the classical psychoanalysis of Freud.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
The classical psychoanalysis of Freud can be represented as an iceberg.

04:09.000 --> 04:20.000
As Freud said, the area of the conscious is the top of the iceberg of the human soul, and the area of the unconscious is what is hidden under water.

04:20.000 --> 04:29.000
It is 80% of the mental processes that control the life and actions of a person.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So, what is the personality of a person in Freud's theory?

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
Or, if we visualize it, as you can see on the slide, in the image of an iceberg hidden under water.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So, what is the area of the conscious?

04:44.000 --> 04:56.000
This is the open part of the iceberg, these are the mental actions and processes that a person realizes, which he controls.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
According to Freud, the super-I, the area of the conscious, is influenced by society.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
The super-I is the control over the criteria of assessment of good, bad, good and evil.

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
However, according to Freud's ideas about the personality of a person, this is only 20% of the motivation of a person's actions.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
As I said, the rest of the 80% is hidden in the area of the unconscious.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
What is the area of the unconscious in Freud's teachings?

05:30.000 --> 05:40.000
So, the I, or as Freud says, is all the attractions, passions, suppressed thoughts, feelings, fears.

05:41.000 --> 05:58.000
This is the so-called pot of passions, where the main impulses boil, which a person inherits, which he is given from birth, which, unfortunately or fortunately, cannot be changed according to the theory of classical psychoanalysis.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
At the same time, they control our lives by 80%.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
So, the pot of passions is the area of our unconscious, it is what Freud calls it.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
These are our attractions, fears, suppressed thoughts, feelings and complexes.

06:15.000 --> 06:28.000
It is this number of passions and impulses, according to the theory of classical psychoanalysis, that controls the motivation of a person's actions, the behavior of a person by 80%.

06:28.000 --> 06:46.000
Between the I, the pot of passions, and the area of the conscious super-I, which I just told you about, there is the so-called mediator, the censor, or, as Freud designated it in his classical psychoanalysis, the I.

06:46.000 --> 07:08.000
This is an internal censor, which is also not subject to the control of a person, but nevertheless it controls these unconscious impulses, unconscious attractions, unconscious passions before they enter the area of the conscious and get involved in words, actions and actions.

07:08.000 --> 07:22.000
Therefore, according to Freud's theory, the life of a person or the psyche of a person is a constant struggle, a constant interaction between it, passions and desires, and the I, the internal censor.

07:22.000 --> 07:48.000
The most important thing is that a person cannot influence their interaction by means of desires and by means of control. Therefore, this energy that a person receives to perform his actions is exactly in the process of an internal conflict between it, desires and passions, and between the unconscious I, the control.

07:48.000 --> 08:03.000
Thus, a person receives energy in the process of constant interaction, or, as he says, struggle between impulses, it, and between the I, the censor, the control of these desires.

08:03.000 --> 08:28.000
Thus, according to Freud's classical psychoanalysis, a person is controlled by the actions of a person, 80% of it is controlled by his subconscious, and only 20% is taken away from the area of the conscious I, and that which is formed in the process of social influence and divides all actions into good and bad.

08:29.000 --> 08:56.000
Freud came to this theory in the process of many years of practical psychotherapeutic practices. However, the strongest influence on the formation of the essence of classical psychoanalysis of Freud was played by the works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Gardner, philosophers, whose works Freud was particularly involved in in recent years.

08:56.000 --> 09:23.000
If we talk about the followers and disciples of Freud, of course, we remember Carl Gustav Jung, a famous Swiss psychotherapist, who in some way repeated Freud's theory of the structure of Personality and at the same time brought his researches and new discoveries to the structure of Personality, which, at one time, let's say, even pleased humanity.

09:23.000 --> 09:49.000
Because if Freud argued that a person is not subject to his reactions and actions, Jung introduced a completely new concept, the so-called self, which is intended to control all these conscious and unconscious parts of Personality that are in a person.

09:50.000 --> 10:14.000
So, what does the structure of Personality look like according to Jung? Well, almost the same. There is a deeply unconscious, so-called shadow, there is a mediator, the so-called mask, there is a conscious I, or I, as Jung said, and, accordingly, there is also the image of a man and a woman, anima and amus.

10:14.000 --> 10:41.000
That is, Jung called this part of the theory of the structure of Personality. So, all these four structures that you see on the diagram are intended to control the self, that is, the higher conscious part of Personality, which is a mediator and has the ability to interfere in the negotiation processes of impulses and control, which Freud could not do.

10:41.000 --> 10:51.000
At the same time, Jung introduced another interesting element into the theory of the structure of Personality, the so-called conscience or collective unconscious.

10:51.000 --> 11:11.000
Here he gives an interesting example in his works. Once a businessman came to him for a consultation and told him about his recent dream. He was preparing for a very important financial deal and in a dream he saw his hands and shoulders dirty with dirt.

11:11.000 --> 11:38.000
He came to Jung for a consultation, what to do to him. Of course, Jung said, interrupt the deal. Based on this dream, Jung draws a certain conclusion that ethical norms or the so-called conscience of a person is an uneducational moment, it is deeply embedded in a person's subconscious and is inherited.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
This is reflected, for example, in such mental processes as sleep.

12:08.000 --> 12:26.000
Now we will consider another theory of the structure of Personality, the so-called Bern Transact Analysis. Why exactly the Bern Transact Analysis, along with the classical theory of psychoanalysis of Freud or Jung's analytical theory?

12:26.000 --> 12:46.000
In order to study the structure of Personality in detail according to Freud and Jung, you need to go very deeply and seriously into the field of psychology. In business, there is no need for managers who are not engaged in psychology to study the structure of Personality in such depth and detail.

12:46.000 --> 13:11.000
Therefore, one of the most successful theories of the structure of Personality, which is applicable in business, which is very easy to apply to the person's idea of ​​himself and other people, which is very effective in the use of coaches in any training of personal growth, sales, interpersonal communication, customer service and management skills.

13:11.000 --> 13:26.000
It is a very clear, simple and accessible theory of the Bern Transact Analysis, which, in fact, is very close and very effectively repeats the theory of psychoanalysis of Freud and Jung.

13:26.000 --> 13:44.000
So, what does the structure of Personality look like according to the Bern Transact Analysis?

13:56.000 --> 14:18.000
The structure of Personality is the same as in childhood up to the age of 3 years. And, as Eric Bern claims, it never changes. That is, all these psychological and mental patterns of behavior, all these installations and reactions that we have learned in childhood up to the age of 3 years live with us and accompany us all our life.

14:18.000 --> 14:35.000
So, if I ask you a question, how does a child behave most often when he encounters an annoying external environment factor? You will answer me, crying, capricious or silent, going into himself.

14:35.000 --> 14:57.000
That's how we learned to react in childhood to the annoying external environment factor. That's how we grow up and become adults, we carry these behavioral patterns all our life. This is our unconscious, this is the lower part of the iceberg, according to the theory of psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud.

14:57.000 --> 15:22.000
This is the second part of Personality, which Eric Bern calls the parent. If we follow Freud's psychoanalysis theory, this is the I that constantly controls and conducts strict censorship between the impulses and desires of a child, or as Freud calls it, it.

15:22.000 --> 15:49.000
So, according to Freud, a child, according to Bern, according to Freud, is it, a parent is me, according to Freud. Who is a parent? How do patterns or behavioral patterns of a parent appear most often? Bad is good, good is bad, black is white, good is evil. That is, a parent is categorical in their assessments, he is always right.

15:49.000 --> 16:02.000
This part of Personality that a person, each of us, got, was inherited from those people who influenced us when we were little.

16:02.000 --> 16:20.000
These are not necessarily only mothers and fathers, but also teachers, teachers, older brothers and sisters, neighbors, friends, in the yard or in the school, in the kindergarten, but it is those people who had, influenced us in childhood.

16:20.000 --> 16:44.000
These behavioral patterns we learn from adults, and they live with us and become a part of our personality. In other words, if a child was brought up very strictly in childhood, there were very strict parents, then there is a possibility that the child will grow up and repeat the pattern of parental behavior.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
He will be as strict and categorical in his attitude to other people.

16:50.000 --> 17:02.000
So, these two parts of our personality are our unconscious, this is the lower part of the iceberg, which we examined in Freud's theory of psychoanalysis.

17:02.000 --> 17:14.000
And another personality, our conscious, or as Eric Bern calls it, our adult.

17:14.000 --> 17:27.000
This is the part of Personality that is devoid of individuality and emotions, this is our consciousness, this is our conscience, as Jung says in his teachings.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
This is the part of our personality that we control because we are well aware of it.

17:34.000 --> 17:46.000
So, our unconscious controls our actions. This is our childhood, which we were brought up with, which is brought up in us at the age of about 3 years.

17:46.000 --> 17:59.000
And this is our parental part, which is passed on to us by inheritance, that is, we learn certain behavioral patterns from those people who at one time had a certain influence on us.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
So, according to Eric Bern, this is how the structure of a person's personality looks like.

18:06.000 --> 18:17.000
Let's discuss whether it is good or bad to have a capricious child or a very strict parent in your personality.

18:17.000 --> 18:25.000
If I ask you a question, please tell me, have you ever been offended, have you ever cried, have you ever been capricious?

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Of course, if you answer no, it will be from a sly person. Of course, yes.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
This is a part of Personality that is necessarily in each of us, to a greater or lesser extent.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
It manifests itself, as a rule, in stressful and critical situations.

18:41.000 --> 18:49.000
In this part of Personality, the creativity of a person is hidden, the potential of his creativity.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Here is his individuality and self-expression.

18:53.000 --> 19:01.000
Why does too oppressive upbringing deprive a person of his individuality in the process of his growth?

19:01.000 --> 19:23.000
Because a person inherits the instillation of his parents, and when he grows up, he does not live his own life, but inherits the instillation of parental influence.

19:23.000 --> 19:32.000
Another question is how a person with a pronounced childlike part can manifest itself in society.

19:32.000 --> 19:43.000
If we draw it symbolically, here is such a childlike part, and the other two are small, the childlike part is very large.

19:43.000 --> 19:59.000
We call them so-called great-old children, who are to a lesser extent deprived of control of this censorship, and behave not as society would like.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
As a rule, these are very talented and extraordinary people who are engaged in art and creativity.

20:07.000 --> 20:21.000
Thus, Eric Bern, to summarize, states that a child and a parent are unconscious in a person, who control the actions and motivations of a person by 80%.

20:21.000 --> 20:37.000
It is impossible to change these two parts of a person, but, as Eric Bern and other psychologists claim, this can be learned to manage and can be learned to live with it organically.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But it is impossible to change it.

20:39.000 --> 20:54.000
How can we use the knowledge of the psychology of a person's personality in business?

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
How can we influence people's behavior or understand the motivation of employees' actions?

21:04.000 --> 21:16.000
At one time, incredibly talented Americans, Katerina Briggs and Isabella Myers, a mother and a daughter, used the discovery of Carl Gustav Jung very effectively,

21:16.000 --> 21:28.000
which had been lying on the shelves for more than 40 years, because it was considered very difficult to access and not quite understandable to the ordinary person to study the type of personality.

21:29.000 --> 21:43.000
Katerina Briggs and Isabella Myers studied Jung's works very carefully and conducted observations and studies of the behavior of people, different people, in the same situations.

21:44.000 --> 21:59.000
They came to the conclusion that different people in the same situations behave differently. Moreover, certain types of personality in certain situations behave in a completely predictable way.

22:00.000 --> 22:20.000
Thus, during the Great Patriotic War, which accelerated the creation of the typology of personality, Katerina Briggs and Isabella Myers observed the behavior of people in non-standard situations, in military conditions, when people had to perform functions that were not their own.

22:21.000 --> 22:39.000
Thus, already in 1980, Katerina Briggs and Isabella Myers created the most interesting and today considered the most popular survey tool for the typology of personality, which is called MBTI.

22:39.000 --> 22:54.000
What is this survey tool, what is its basis, what characteristics of personality types are included in this survey tool, and how to determine each type of personality of each person and, in fact, for what.

22:55.000 --> 23:17.000
Katerina Briggs and Isabella Myers give a very clear answer that the knowledge of the typology of personality in business will help to manage people in the most effective way, knowing their strengths and using them for effective work and concentrating on the strengths,

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
since each person has more powerful and less powerful sides of nature.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
So, the typology of personality and 8 main characteristics of personality types are represented by pairs.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
According to Myers-Briggs, the type of a person is represented in 4 formats.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
The first of them is the source of energy, from where a person draws energy in life.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Extrovert, introvert. We will consider each type sequentially and separately, now all 4 at once.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
The second is the center of human attention and the way of obtaining information from the environment.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
It turns out that different people get different information from the outside world.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
The third characteristic is the way of making decisions.

24:10.000 --> 24:18.000
According to Jung, Freud and the statement of Myers-Briggs, people make decisions in different ways.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Some people make logical decisions, others make heart-shaped decisions.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
And the last characteristic is the lifestyle of an individual.

24:27.000 --> 24:39.000
So, let's consider each characteristic separately and see how it can be applied in business, in work, in the formation of working groups and working teams.

24:40.000 --> 24:52.000
So, extrovert and introvert. As I said, this is a characteristic that determines the source of energy, from where a person draws energy to perform certain tasks.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
So, extrovert is the outside world, tasks, objects.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
In other words, this is a person who needs to interact with someone all the time and communicate all the time.

25:05.000 --> 25:15.000
And this is his way of survival, because it is in communication with other people, in the process of exchanging information, that he receives energy, a push for development.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
And introvert is a person who loves solitude, feelings and reflection.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
This is a person who receives energy in solitude, feelings and reflection.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Probably, each of you has now thought about yourself.

25:32.000 --> 25:44.000
Where is it more comfortable for him to be? Most often in constant communication and interaction with other people, or still in reflections, solitude and feelings?

25:45.000 --> 25:52.000
Well, I will give you two simple examples so that you can understand who is an extrovert and who is an introvert.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
An extrovert is a consultant, a seller in a store.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
A visitor comes to him and asks a completely strange question.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Tell me, please, can I buy half a bunch of parsley?

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
To which the seller, the consultant, I note, the extrovert, goes for advice to his manager.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
He goes to the manager, followed by the buyer, although the consultant does not see this.

26:19.000 --> 26:28.000
The consultant approaches the manager and asks, Boss, just some weirdo came and asks, can I buy half a bunch of parsley?

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
Accidentally turns around and sees a buyer standing next to him, to which he immediately reacts and notes,

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
but this nice person agreed to buy a second bunch of parsley.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
That is, this is a person who is in constant communication and contact, and, they say, he will not go out of his way.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Or the second example is an introvert.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
A teacher ties shoes to a boy in a kindergarten.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
She puts them on his feet for a long time, then she ties them up for a long time.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
At the end, when she ties the last bow, the boy says, these are my brother's shoes.

27:09.000 --> 27:17.000
To which the teacher gently unties his shoelaces, unties the shoes, carefully removes the shoes.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
And in the end, the boy says the following phrase, but my mother has already allowed me to wear them, because my brother grew up from them.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.000
Yes, an introvert, who needs to concentrate and get ready a lot in order to say the following phrase.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
You can now understand that if you have an extrovert in your department, in the department, in the organization,

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
and your subordinate, your employee, an extrovert is next to you,

27:44.000 --> 27:51.000
if you make an extrovert do reports and routine monotonous work for a week,

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
he will not survive for a long time in your group, just because he will lose energy, he will run out of energy.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
This is not him.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
Or vice versa. This often happens when an introvert is sent to a presentation.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
After the second or third presentation, for some reason, it is strange, the person writes a statement and leaves,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
because he does not receive energy there, he loses it there.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
What is the effectiveness?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
The clearer we determine whether a person is an extrovert or an introvert,

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
the more effectively we can use his strong sides in the process of performing work tasks.

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
So, the next feature is the center of attention and the way of obtaining or collecting information.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
There are two categories of people who receive information thanks to five senses,

28:46.000 --> 28:52.000
they collect information in the present, what is next to them, or in the past.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
This is a sensory type.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And there is an intuitive type.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
This is a person who collects information, sees the task and sees the end point.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
These are people who are able to see the whole picture on top, unlike sensory people,

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
who can make a mosaic, step by step, step by step.

29:15.000 --> 29:23.000
For example, two sensory and intuitive thieves climb to the 13th floor to rob an apartment.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Suddenly, a figure moves towards them.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
The intuitive says, let's jump faster.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
What does the sensory answer?

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Wait, the 13th floor, I managed to count quickly, sensory.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
What does the intuitive answer?

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
You know, now is not the time for superstition, jump.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
So, the next feature of a person according to the typology of the personality MBTI is a way of making decisions.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
As Myers-Briggs claims, people are divided into two categories according to the way of making decisions.

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
There are also two categories, the thinking ones, who make decisions based on logic and the concept of right or wrong.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
And the sensory ones, who make decisions based on personal values.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
As an example, the thinking ones.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Two brothers, one of them goes on a long trip and leaves his dog with his younger brother Jim.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
A few days later, the brother calls from the trip and asks, Jim, how is my dog?

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
To which the thinking Jim replies, your dog is dead.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
How is it dead? You could not prepare me for a few days, you should have said on the first day that the dog was not feeling well.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
The next day I would call you, you would say that she was getting a little worse.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
And only on the third day, when I would be morally ready for this, you would tell me that the dog was dead.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
By the way, how is my mother doing? Your mother is feeling very bad, says the thinking brother Jim.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
So, the sensory ones.

31:04.000 --> 31:13.000
The person swallowed a glass eye, walked for a long time, then finally he had a stomachache, he decided to turn to the doctor.

31:13.000 --> 31:20.000
When he came to the doctor and reported that he had a stomachache, the doctor began to examine the patient from behind.

31:21.000 --> 31:33.000
He saw an eye there, to which he said the following phrase, the sensory one, F, to the patient, if you do not trust me, I will not be able to cure you.

31:34.000 --> 31:47.000
Thus, you also have employees in your department who are related to the type of thinking, who make decisions based on logic, whether it is correct or not,

31:48.000 --> 31:56.000
and to the type of the sensory, the feeling, who make decisions based on their personal inner values.

31:57.000 --> 32:09.000
And the last characteristic of the personality type, according to the typology of BTI, is the lifestyle, it is the judgment of J and the perception of P.

32:10.000 --> 32:18.000
People of J, as Myers-Briggs calls them, live in an orderly and predictable world.

32:18.000 --> 32:31.000
People of P live in a deep, spontaneous world, where the options of choice and decision are open, and, by the way, decisions are not made until the very last moment.

32:32.000 --> 32:41.000
Well, if we draw two parallel characteristics, for example, how J is going to buy a car, and how P is going to buy a car,

32:42.000 --> 32:51.000
J will plan for a very long time in which garage he will put his car, if he has a garage, he will definitely put it in order in time,

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
if he does not have a garage, he will definitely choose a place where he will put it for a long time, if it is possible.

32:58.000 --> 33:10.000
Only after that he will buy a car. P, unlike J, makes a decision at the very last moment, first he will buy a car, and then he will choose a place or clean the garage.

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
Or, for example, parents call J, a person who lives by the judgments in a predictable world.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
I missed you, would you like to come to visit me? What will J do?

33:26.000 --> 33:36.000
First, he will check his timetable, his schedule, he will go for a while, take tickets, every day he will wake up and check whether the day of departure has come to his parents.

33:37.000 --> 33:48.000
What will P do if he makes a decision now, he will go to the station now, he will buy a ticket, and only then he will understand that he cannot go to his parents tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
because it turns out that he has a schedule and he is going to return this ticket.

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
So, J is a predictable world, P is an impulse and a momentary decision.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
Based on these four criteria, there are several temperaments.

34:10.000 --> 34:23.000
In other words, Myers-Briggs highlights four main temperaments, which to some extent affect the development and business.

34:24.000 --> 34:34.000
So, one is the NF temperament. As you understand, each temperament, if you pay attention to the table, consists of four defining letters.

34:35.000 --> 34:47.000
Remember, the first is the method from which energy is drawn, the second letter indicates the method of searching and gathering information, the third is the method of making decisions, and the fourth is the lifestyle.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
So, the NF temperament is people who always see the prospects.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
These are very deeply sensitive people, personal qualities of others are always important to them.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
They can notice the best in other people, they can inspire others to achieve their goals.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
These are leaders. As you remember, N is sensitive and intuitive people.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
Let's consider each temperament in the same situation.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
The NF temperament is a person who is driving on the road and sees the speed limit.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
Please slow down to 30 km per hour, fasten your seat belt, otherwise you will be fined.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
Of course, the NF temperament is a person who will tell you if you do not fasten your seat belt next to him.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
Please fasten your seat belt, I do not want to lose you, I will worry about you.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
These are people who talk most often about feelings and attitude to others.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
So, the next temperament is the NT temperament.

35:52.000 --> 35:59.000
These are people who can collect information on a large scale, while making decisions using logic.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
N is large-scale perspectives, T is logical thinking.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
These are people of strategy, people who see the prospects.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
They are very ambitious and have no authorities except themselves.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Because they are guided by their own standards and always put the authorities and sources offered to them in doubt.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
These are people who are very good at strategic projects.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
They are very enthusiastic and take risks.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
What will the NT say if you do not fasten your seat belt next to him?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
He will support you.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
He will say that this is a violation of human rights, this is a pressure on my freedom.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
In general, I decide whether I should fasten my seat belt or not.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
I decide whether I am ready to pay a fine or not.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
This is a person who puts all the authorities in doubt.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
The next temperament is S temperament.

37:01.000 --> 37:12.000
As you remember, S is a sensitive person who makes logical decisions and lives by the standards set by the so-called SJ.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
These are very practical, very organized, very structured employees and people in general.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
They obey the rules and order.

37:23.000 --> 37:32.000
Of course, you can guess without me and answer the question how SJ will react if you do not fasten your seat belt next to him.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
He will definitely tell you to fasten your seat belt.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
This is the law.

37:39.000 --> 37:46.000
Because these are people who know how to establish laws themselves and know how to follow these laws very clearly.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
They know how to organize others to comply with these laws.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
And the last temperament is a rather rare temperament.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
This is S temperament.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
This is a person who can collect information using five senses.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
Remember, S is a sensitive person and at the same time very impulsive and makes quick decisions.

38:10.000 --> 38:18.000
Therefore, they are called so-called crisis managers because they act very effectively in the conditions of crises and conflicts.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
What will the SP temperament say if you do not fasten your seat belt next to him?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
This is a risk environment for him, this is his environment.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
Therefore, he will say, yes, it will be funny to fly at a speed of more than 30 km per hour to the window with a seat belt on.

38:36.000 --> 38:51.000
So, according to the typology of the personality MBTI, you can now see such an unusual picture, which consists of 16 types of personality,

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
each of which, each temperament that we have just described, is marked in a certain color.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
In vertical, temperament NF is leaders who feel and inspire.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
This is NT, green color, these are strategists who see the prospects, know how to generate ideas and interesting projects.

39:13.000 --> 39:22.000
This is the blue color of temperament SJ, these are people who are very organized and very good at organizing others to work.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
And, accordingly, so-called risk managers are people who work effectively in the conditions of crises and conflicts.

39:29.000 --> 39:38.000
This large table is divided into two parts because the two lower lines are extroverts, the two upper lines are introverts.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Temperament is the same.

39:41.000 --> 39:50.000
Thus, if we are talking about creating an effective team and within the framework of organizational behavior,

39:51.000 --> 40:01.000
it is simply necessary to know the structure of the personality and take into account the typology of the personality, according to Myers-Briggs.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Why?

40:04.000 --> 40:20.000
Now I will give you an example from a real business, in which the research of the top managers team was carried out on the percentage of temperaments that exist in it.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And what was revealed?

40:24.000 --> 40:35.000
So, people who are able to generate a large number of ideas and see on a large scale, this is a green salad column, temperament NT,

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
there were 39% of such people in the company at the top managers level.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This is a fairly high percentage.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
Pay attention to people who could execute and implement ideas.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
These are good, responsible executors, they are marked in blue in the gray line, SJ, 46%.

40:58.000 --> 41:07.000
Pay attention, approximately equal number of those who create ideas and equal number of those who can implement these ideas.

41:08.000 --> 41:17.000
At the same time, the company experienced incredibly large problems in that it suffered from these mega-projects.

41:18.000 --> 41:29.000
That is, there were a lot of people who generated interesting ideas and a very large number of top managers who could pick up ideas and start to prescribe them at the business process level.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Look at what an interesting phenomenon.

41:33.000 --> 41:41.000
It seems that there are enough people who can generate ideas and there is no shortage of ideas.

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
At the same time, there are people who are able to implement ideas at the business process level, to describe their implementation process.

41:50.000 --> 41:58.000
However, all ideas, for some strange reason, died at the second step of implementation.

41:59.000 --> 42:07.000
The company could not pick them up, not financially, but simply could not pick them up for some reason.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
They died at the level of the executors, the same operators, the same operators who directly communicate with the clients.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
The reason is the following.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
The readiness to disclose the best qualities and persuasiveness in people is the NF temperament.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
Pay attention, the team has only 10%.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
That is, there are ideas, there are executors.

42:31.000 --> 42:41.000
A large shortage of people who could convey these ideas, inspire and convince the ordinary employees of new projects.

42:42.000 --> 42:49.000
Therefore, in this company, according to the results of the research using the typology of the personality of the MBTI,

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
an offer was made to include several people with the NF temperament in the top managers.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
That is, leaders who could convey ideas to ordinary executors.

43:03.000 --> 43:11.000
Accordingly, the situation leveled out in six months, because there were these stakeholders,

43:12.000 --> 43:20.000
who could very effectively convey ideas and changes to the lowest levels of the company employees.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Thus, dear listeners, knowing the typology of the personality of the MBTI,

43:26.000 --> 43:32.000
you can learn to effectively build a team and manage the efficiency of the work of this team.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
For example, the task of generating ideas, developing some strategic plans.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
Of course, you will assign people who are related to the temperament of the NT, the strategists.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
This is the meaning of their work, and in this place they will be the most effective.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
But if you assign them to create some reports or describe business processes,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
you may not always get an effective result,

44:00.000 --> 44:08.000
because the temperament of these people is their less powerful side, monotonous and non-creative work.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
Of course, you will assign monotonous and non-creative work to the temperament of the SJ.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
These are sensitive, consistent and predictable people,

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
who, if you say that the report should be on the table tomorrow at 9 am,

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
you can sleep peacefully, because this report will be on your table at 9 am.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
If you need to introduce a person to the team,

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
who can build interpersonal communication between all the team members,

44:38.000 --> 44:44.000
of course, remember that it is necessary to concentrate the search on the temperament of the NF,

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
on people who can build interpersonal communication and inspire other people.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
However, if you assign them to monotonous and sensitive work,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
related to weekly reports and creating routine and consistent actions,

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
you will not get results from such people, not because they do not know how to do it or do not want to do it,

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
but because the personality and determination of these people are completely different.

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
It is clear that when you have crisis situations in the group,

45:19.000 --> 45:27.000
of course, the most effective way to use the temperament of the SP is to get out of the window with unbuttoned belts.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
It's funny, because these are the elements of a crisis situation.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
If you assign the temperament of the SP to monotonous and routine work,

45:37.000 --> 45:44.000
or to build interpersonal communication, you can only think that they can spoil everything.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
Therefore, knowing the typology of the personality Myers-Briggs or MPTI, as it is called in the world,

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
you can very effectively build a team and manage organizational behavior,

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
knowing the stronger and less strong sides of your employees.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Personality and self-perception

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
So, now we will get acquainted with the concept of self-perception and feedback,

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
and what psychological institutions are at the heart of the perception of one individual over another.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
So, what is personal perception?

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
Personal perception is the obtaining and processing of information about one subject over another.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
As an object and a subject of information, both individual and a group of people can act.

46:44.000 --> 46:52.000
However, the complexity of the process of perception is that the ability of a person to process information is not limitless.

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
When forming the image of a partner, a person encounters a certain amount of fragmentary information,

46:59.000 --> 47:07.000
that is, with pieces of information, and evaluates them taking into account personal psychological and emotional institutions.

47:08.000 --> 47:16.000
The entire restlessness of information in these fragments is built up by a person based on his personal subjective experience.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
Thus, information distortion occurs.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
Now I will demonstrate to you what the distortion of information looks like on a small game.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Please get ready.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Prepare a sheet of paper and a pen.

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
I have a drawing on a flip chart that consists of geometric figures.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
This is a complete drawing, a semantic drawing, consisting of geometric figures.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
You do not see this drawing.

47:51.000 --> 47:58.000
I will describe to you how the drawing on my flip chart looks in parts.

47:59.000 --> 48:09.000
At the same time, I have a clear establishment that I cannot use any geometric terms in the process of describing my drawing.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
Otherwise, I will use associations associated with these geometric terms.

48:16.000 --> 48:23.000
For example, if I need to say that this is a circle, then instead of the word circle I will use an apple.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
Or if I need to say that this is a rectangle, then instead of a rectangle I will use the term table top view.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Clear?

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
Thus, I will also play the role of one of the participants in the game

48:40.000 --> 48:48.000
and I will demonstrate to you how he sees the information I provide and how it goes through the stages of distortion.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
So, attention.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
Please draw the lower part of the woman's dress in the middle of the sheet.

48:58.000 --> 49:10.000
Now please draw an inverted iron without a handle over the upper part of the figure that you have depicted.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
After you have drawn an inverted iron without a handle,

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
from the middle of it up, please draw a pencil.

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
On the right of the pencil, please draw a figure that looks like a bag of milk.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
The game is over.

49:34.000 --> 49:41.000
Now please compare your drawings, the drawings of the imaginary participant in the game,

49:42.000 --> 49:49.000
with the original drawing that I tried to convey to you without using any geometric terms.

49:49.000 --> 49:59.000
In other words, I tried to convey some parts of the information to you not just in a hidden way, but in a figurative way.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
So, the original drawing looked like this.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
The lower part of the woman's dress,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
an inverted iron without a handle,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
a pencil in the middle and up,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
a bag of milk on the right,

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
which was used in the Soviet era.

50:22.000 --> 50:30.000
Thus, a psychological phenomenon called openness is of great importance for mutual understanding.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
What is openness?

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
Openness is a psychological phenomenon that depends on the level of awareness of one's inner self

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
and self-perception at the personal level.

50:44.000 --> 50:52.000
It should be remembered that an inadequate idea of ​​one's own self creates many psychological barriers to communication.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
But the conditions for forming an adequate idea of ​​one's own personality

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
are its perception and analysis of one's behavior from the point of view of others.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
The process of receiving feedback in interaction,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
based on which the image of one's own self is formed,

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
can be demonstrated on the model created by Joseph Loft and Harry Ingham,

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
which is now called the Johari window in psychology and sociology.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
What is the Johari window and what does it look like?

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
The Johari window consists of four squares,

51:32.000 --> 51:42.000
each of which represents a definition of a person's awareness in society and awareness of a person himself.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Please pay attention to the slide.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
There are two lines in the Johari window, horizontal and vertical.

51:53.000 --> 52:00.000
In this case, the vertical line divides the Johari window into two parts, the right and the left.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
The left part, the blue one on your slide,

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
is all the information that a person knows about himself,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
that is, his open zone and his hidden zone.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
But the orange part, the right part,

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
is all the information that a person does not know about himself,

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
that is, his blind zone and his unknown zone.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Also, along the horizontal line,

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
only here we have the lower part of the Johari window and the upper part of the Johari window.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
The lower part of the window represents the information

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
that a person does not know about himself, society or group,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
that is, his hidden zone and unknown zone.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
And, accordingly, the upper part along the horizontal line

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
is the information that a group knows about a person,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
that is, his open zone and his blind zone.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Thus, let's consider each zone separately.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
So, zone number one is open.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
This is information about an individual, about a person,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
known to him or herself and to others.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
It is quite clear that the larger the open zone,

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
the more trust relationships are established.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Zone number two is the so-called blind zone.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
This is information about a person, which is known to other people,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
but unknown to him or herself.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
That is, it is the opinion of others about a Personality.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
Here is the following situation.

53:44.000 --> 53:50.000
If the opinion of others about me coincides with my idea of ​​myself,

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
I have good and normal relations with these people or with a group of these people.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
If the opinion of others does not coincide with my idea of ​​myself,

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
but is somewhat subdued,

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
there are likely conflicts and, in general,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
there are likely to be no relations at all.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
If the opinion of others is somewhat subdued with my own assessment of myself,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I perceive it as a leap.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
It should be noted that everything related to the blind zone

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
can become a manipulation of an open person's consciousness.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
That is, a subdued assessment is a manipulation,

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
and, accordingly, a deliberately subdued assessment of a person's actions

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
is also a deliberate manipulation of another person's consciousness.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
The next zone is the hidden zone.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
This is information about a person, known to him or herself,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
but hidden from the group for various reasons.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
The reasons can be different,

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
it is just not possible to demonstrate one's knowledge,

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
skills, skills, behavior patterns, behavior manners,

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
or for some specific reason a person was even given the opportunity,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
but he did not want to demonstrate it.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
If in the previous case the so-called blind zone

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
in order to get feedback,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
you need to ask more questions and ask,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
listen to the opinion of others,

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
then in order to develop your hidden zone,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
you need to talk more,

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
talk about yourself, demonstrate your qualities, skills, and skills without hesitation.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
And, accordingly, the fourth sector is the unknown zone.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Otherwise, we say that this is our unconscious part,

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
our Personality, which is not known to us,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
is not visible, is invisible to others.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
And this part of our Personality or our psychological institutions

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
is manifested only in stressful and extreme situations.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
Sometimes, as the research of psychologists shows,

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
this zone in a person never appears throughout his life.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Accordingly, each square in the window of the jahari

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
at different times and in different situations

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
has a different size.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
It is quite clear that at the stage of establishing contacts,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
at the stage of establishing relationships,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
we will have a very small, small open zone,

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
accordingly, the unknown zone, the blind and the hidden will be quite large.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
However, in the process of interaction,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
in the process of communication, in the process of life and interaction in a group,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
we receive feedback from the group,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
we provide information about ourselves to the group,

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
and, accordingly, our open zone becomes larger.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Thus, if a person is closed from others,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
he begins to realize himself worse.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
And, on the contrary, when a person behaves openly,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
others can learn more about him,

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
and, consequently, he will receive more feedback.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
And this increases the possibility of mutual understanding in a group

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
or in a pair of personal contact.

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
The problem of perception is well-developed in social psychology.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
The term social perception

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
was first introduced by the American psychologist Bruner.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
He conducted numerous experiments,

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
thanks to which he established that it turns out

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
that our personal perception is influenced not only by our personal psychological and emotional institutions,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
but also by sociocultural factors.

58:01.000 --> 58:07.000
For example, it was proposed to children from poor families to determine the size of coins.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
And it turned out that children from poor families

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
somewhat exceeded the size of a real coin.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
And, on the contrary, children from rich families

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
imagined the size of a coin a little smaller than it is in real life.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
Or, for example, the same deformation in the studies on the growth,

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
on the perception of human growth.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
A group of students was proposed to assess the growth of certain people.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
At the same time, each person was assigned his social status

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
as a lab assistant, teacher, teacher, professor.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
It turned out that the higher the social status of a person,

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
the higher his growth was perceived by a group of students.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
Thus, I emphasize, Bruner introduced such a concept as sociocultural factors.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
That is, not only our psychological and emotional institutions,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
everything related to the type of personality,

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
remember, the theory of personality of Freud, Jung, Bern,

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
what we have already studied, but also sociocultural factors.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
The psychological mechanisms of perception in intergroup communication

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
are related to the process of so-called social stereotyping.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
The essence of this is that the perception of a certain person's image

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
is based on certain type schemes.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I will give you a simple example.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
For 10 years I have been teaching at various universities.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And students come to my first course.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Here is a very noticeable effect of social stereotyping.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Let's take students of recent years.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because social stereotyping differs from students of 5, 7 and 10 years ago.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It turns out that a student who wears a certain brand of certain clothes,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Versace, drives a certain brand of a car,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
is perceived by the group as more successful,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
more intelligent and more intellectually developed student.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
All other students, who, according to their intellectual characteristics,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
may outperform those above, are not perceived by the group.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Everything is equated to the second and third courses,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
when people enter into closer relations,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and when the effect of the initial perception,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
that is, the attitude of a person to a certain group

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
due to social stereotyping, ceases to work,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
then, accordingly, other characteristics come to the forefront,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and, accordingly, other students become smarter, more intellectual.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
However, the important characteristics,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
those that allow to attribute a partner or a person to a certain group,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
are quite precise.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That is, in terms of how a person dresses,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
what manner of behavior he has, how he talks,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
we, in the initial perception, attribute him to a certain group.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
This is true.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
However, the mistake is different.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We refine the other features of the personality,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
the intellect of this person,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and here we make a mistake,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
because we can overestimate the personality of a person,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
or vice versa,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
by some certain factors that he does not have,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
we can underestimate him.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Thus, these initial perception mistakes are due to three main factors.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
These are superiority, attractiveness, and attitude to us.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So, the perception scheme is as follows.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Each of us has important criteria for us,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and information about superiority is usually

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
embedded in clothes and manner of behavior.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
For example, I have a certain inner criterion,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I have a car of a certain class, of a certain value,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and my inner criterion is that a person who drives the same car as me is successful,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and if he drives a car of a higher class and more expensive,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
he is even more successful.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Therefore, all people who fall into my field of view,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
who drive other cars of a higher class and more expensive,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I tend to overestimate them.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It seems to me that they are smarter, better, stronger, and more successful.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
However, if a person falls into my field of view,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
who has a car of a lower class, or does not have a car at all,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I tend to underestimate him.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It seems to me that he is less successful, less intelligent, less interesting.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I repeat, this is a perception error.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
There are certain social stereotypes that we attribute to the class,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000
while we underestimate or overestimate other deeper personal characteristics.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Now let's see how the attractiveness factor works in life.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
The attractiveness factor is, as noted in psychology,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
a beautiful, I quote, and ugly appearance.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
It is that we also, focusing on the beautiful and ugly appearance of a person,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
we tend to overestimate or underestimate his personal characteristics.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Once there was an interesting experiment.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Teachers were offered the personal affairs of their students

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
in order to assess their intellectual abilities,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
their abilities, their relationship with peers, and some plans for the future.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The whole trick of the experiment was that there was one personal affair,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
but it was pasted on by different photos of different children.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
There were photos of beautiful children and ugly children.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It is interesting that as a result of this experiment,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
all personal affairs with photos of beautiful children received the highest marks

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and the highest promising prospects for development.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Photos with the personal affairs of children on which ugly children were pasted,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I quote, and ugly children received low marks

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and low opportunities and prospects for development.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So, attractiveness is not only our individual personal impression,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but, as psychologists have proven, it also has a social nature.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And the third factor that is a companion of information distortion and perception

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
is the factor of attitude to us.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
In fact, everything that indicates agreement and disagreement of a partner with us.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
A lot of different experiments were also conducted here,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and, accordingly, a group of people perceived the lecturer.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
If the opinion of the lecturer coincided with the group of participants,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
the lecturer was perceived as successful, intellectual, his own, as a relative soul.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
If the opinion of the lecturer did not coincide with the opinion of the group of participants,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.000
it was strange and it was customary to underestimate the intellectual and personal characteristics of the lecturer.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
He was not perceived as his own, and, accordingly,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
the attitude to this lecturer in the group was completely different

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
than that whose opinion coincided with the group.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Thus, we have just considered three key factors that affect the primary perception,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
that is, in the process of primary contact.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So, it is attractiveness, superiority and attitude to us.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
However, when people enter into a longer, longer contact,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
completely different perception factors act here,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
such as identification, empathy and reflection.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Now we will consider the psychological mechanisms of perception and understanding in the process of constant communication.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
These are three components — identification, empathy and reflection.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
What is identification?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It is an assimilation of oneself to another person.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That is, in the process of interaction,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
people are accustomed to putting themselves in the place of another person and predict,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
how I would act in the place of this person if…

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
In the book by Dale Carnegie, How to Influence People,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
the process of identification is described very well,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
that is, the ability to put oneself in the place of another person,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
how I would act in this situation.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The next point of perception is empathy.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Empathy is an understanding not at the level of thoughts,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
how I would act, but at the level of feelings.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It is an attempt to emotionally respond to the problems of another person.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The founder of the humanistic psychology, Rogers,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
once spoke about empathy,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
that it is the ability to enter into the feelings of another person

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and live them as another person lives them.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Well, the feeling of empathy is a very serious psychological load,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
because if we live through the emotional state of all the people

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
we encounter in life,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
there is a syndrome of burnout,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
especially among those employees,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
those categories of employees,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
who are associated with communication with clients,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
support services, call centers, operators,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
those professions that are associated with constant interaction

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
with the problems of other people.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Therefore, the level of their empathy is very strictly controlled

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
at the level of skill training,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
because if you go deep into the problem of each client,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
accordingly, I repeat,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it is a very serious psychological load.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And people, as a rule, burn out very quickly during the year,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
they have such a stress syndrome.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And the third point of perception and understanding is reflexion,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
it is the awareness of the acting individual

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
of how he is perceived by the partner in communication.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That is, if at the level of empathy and identification

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
we are trying to understand the feelings of others or thoughts of others,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
then at the level of reflexion we are not only trying to understand the feelings and thoughts of others,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
but also to build a scheme of how another person perceives me after that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
That is, such a double reflection of actions of each other.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Actually, these three main psychological mechanisms

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
lie at the base of perception and understanding

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
when longer relationships are established.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
What are the key issues of the psychological system?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Thus, today we have considered the key issues

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
related to the Personality and psychological systems.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Personality and psychological systems are a topic

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
that can be discussed for more than one, two, and even a whole week.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Therefore, we have taken the key points

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that are very applicable and understandable in business.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So, we have considered the main theories of personality structure.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
This is Freud's classical psychoanalysis,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Jung's analytical theory of personality structure,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
and Bern's transactional analysis.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Next, we have learned about Myers-Briggs typology,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
which is based on Carl Jung's theory,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
and on the points that can be applied in practice,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
at the moments of the typology of the personality of MBTI.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
We have also learned about the window of Jahari

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and such concepts as self-perception and feedback.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I wish you further success in your work.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I sincerely hope that the knowledge gained in today's course

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
will be useful not only in business, but also in personal life.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Thank you.
