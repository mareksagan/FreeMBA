00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
So, friends, we have finished the first chapter,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.820
we have defined the main parameters of planning,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.020
and now we are moving directly to the planning process.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.420
First of all, we are engaged in forecasting the money flows.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.720
In general, planning of finances,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.620
strategic, operational, tactical,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.220
is the final stage of planning

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.220
of the entire business activity.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
In order to make a financial plan,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
we need the data of the marketing plan,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.220
production plan, organizational plans,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220
and all other types of business plans.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
But to follow the composition of these plans,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.220
usually in parallel,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
since it is necessary to ensure feedback,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.220
to take into account the production realities,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
and, on the contrary,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220
to make adjustments to the management plans

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
according to the parameters of the financial planning.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Financial planning is based on the concept of money flows.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.220
You remember this scheme,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.220
this is the basic scheme of German financial management.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.220
This scheme allows us to look at the enterprise

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
in a relationship with other enterprises.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
The scheme of money flows.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.220
Here we see how the enterprise is connected

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.220
with other enterprises in the markets of production,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.220
in the markets of purchases.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
We have a state, we have financial markets

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
from which the enterprise receives loans,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.220
and all this is aimed at one task,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
to ensure the continuity of money flows.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
We need to ensure liquidity.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
Therefore, in the planning phase,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.220
we first link commodity flows with financial flows

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.220
and provide for all the upcoming payment obligations

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.220
to be paid in due time

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
to suppliers, to creditors,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.220
to employees of the enterprise on the salary,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
of course, to the state.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.220
Thus, the task is to cover all possible deficits in due time

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.220
or, again, we do not forget that money should work,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.220
so we provide for the effective use of free financial resources,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.220
of surplus.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.220
The planning process involves a certain sequence,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.220
certain steps of planning.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.220
In general, they are universal and go in one scheme.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.220
First of all, we need to consider all commodity flows.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.220
What commodity flows we have from the markets of purchases,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220
what resources we buy,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220
how much, with what frequency,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.220
and, accordingly, we must determine how much financial funds

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220
will be needed for this in the financial planning.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
We must develop an investment plan,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.220
additional investments if we plan to expand activity

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.220
or, in general, investments if we create a new enterprise.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
In parallel with the investment plan,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.220
accordingly, we have an amortization calculation plan.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.220
Then we must calculate the cost of revenue

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.220
and calculate the cost for this revenue.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.220
In addition, when growing revenue,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.220
we must take into account that we will need

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
some additional investments,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
investments in reserves.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.220
This is the sphere of turnover calculations,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.220
pure turnover capital.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.220
After that, we can start

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.220
directly forming the main document of financial planning,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.220
the table of money flows.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220
Well, first we can conditionally call this table

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.220
the table of real commodity exchange.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.220
Here we apply only the positions

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.220
associated with the movement of goods,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.220
namely, revenue, cost,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.220
the purchase of necessary machines, equipment,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.220
the creation of stock of return funds.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.220
The result of this table shows us

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.220
the need for financing.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.220
This table is necessarily made up

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.220
for the entire horizon of planning

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.220
with a breakdown of planning steps.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
We are talking about a forecast document,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.220
a document that is made up for several years,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.220
at least 5 years, 3-5 years,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.220
and is broken down into smaller planning steps.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.220
In the simplest form, this is according to the years.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.220
Sometimes the features of planning,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.220
the features of the enterprise's activities

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.220
can imply quarterly planning.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.220
Even forecast planning

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.220
is a breakdown by quarters.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
We see that this table reflects all the flows

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.220
and outflows of funds that are necessary

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.220
for the maintenance of operational processes,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.220
real commodity exchange processes.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.220
Here is the sequence of components.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.220
Revenue from implementation,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.220
which comes to us from the marketing plan,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.220
how many goods, what price we produce,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.220
is reflected in the revenue,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.220
and the cost of the budget,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.220
the cost of the cost of the budget,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.220
is calculated.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.220
Next, we determine the need for investment.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.220
That is, the manufacturers calculate

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.220
the number of machines.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.220
We calculate the money we need

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
to purchase the main resources

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.220
and to create a supply of return funds.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
And finally, this table,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.220
when we put the funding sources,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220
provides liquidity.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.220
That is, the net cash flow is not negative.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.220
This is the parameter

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.220
that guarantees the profitability of our business

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.220
along with increasing profitability

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.220
and profitability,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.220
the growth of the business's cost.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.220
This kind of table is simplified,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.220
but it allows us to summarize

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.220
and show the interconnection

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.220
of all inflows and outflows of funds.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.220
In practice, they are more often

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.220
in a slightly different form.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.220
They divide the cash flows

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.220
in the sphere of their occurrence,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.220
highlighting operational,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.220
investment and financial activity.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.220
This is a detailed scheme of cash flows

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.220
in an electronic textbook.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.220
I ask you to carefully understand this scheme.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.220
It shows all accounting realities

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.220
and the correspondence of these flows

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
and the primary sources,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.220
what it means in accounting language

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220
and where the primary information

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.220
is located.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.220
This table shows the inflows and outflows

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.220
of funds and the financial result of the net cash flow.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.220
This is nothing more than a direct method

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.220
of forecasting cash flows.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.220
I think it is very convenient and clear.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.220
The main goal of this table

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.220
is not to miss any of the components

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.220
of the cash flows.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.220
In addition to the direct method

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.220
of forecasting cash flows,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.220
the broad spread received

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.220
a indirect method of forecasting cash flows.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.220
That is, when we deduce

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.220
our resulting indicator,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.220
the net cash flow,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.220
from the data of other financial documents.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.220
In a very simplified concept,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.220
the net cash flow is calculated

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.220
from the total net profit,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.220
depreciation deductions,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.220
as well as the change in debt,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.220
plus or minus the credit and debit debt.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.220
These quantities are calculated

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.220
at any enterprise

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.220
according to accounting or planned forms,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.220
form 1 and form 2.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.220
Most companies use the indirect method

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.220
because it is easy to use.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.220
If you look at the financial reports

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.220
of international companies,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.220
you will see that after the main positions

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.220
there is a turnover, a profit,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.220
and a cash flow.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.220
This is exactly what we get

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.220
in the process of financial planning.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.220
In addition, I want to remind you

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.220
that cash flows and horizon of planning

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.220
are a matter of time.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.220
The cash flows we receive

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.220
and pay out at different times

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.220
are not equal to us.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.220
The later we get the financial result,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220
the less interesting it is for us.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.220
I remind you about discounting,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.220
about how to provide data compatibility.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.220
If we want to calculate the financial result

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.220
by the growing result,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.220
by summing up the net cash flow by years,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.220
we do not have the right to do this directly

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.220
by adding up the net cash flow

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.220
of the first period of 100 units,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.220
adding up the net cash flow

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.220
of the second period of 100 units,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.220
these units are not equal to each other.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.220
Before adding them up,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.220
we need to discount them.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.220
In total, the discounted amount of the cash flow

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.220
is equal to the total discounted value

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.220
of the current value

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.220
that summarizes the financial result

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.220
of the activity during all periods of planning.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.220
This indicator is usually necessary

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.220
for the new enterprise.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.220
We are now starting to calculate

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.220
the investment needs.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.220
We should remember that this is

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.220
the investment in the property,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.220
in the assets of the enterprise.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.220
Investments are used in the capital,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.220
the connection of capital in production,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.220
the acquisition of property.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.220
On the diagram you can see

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.220
the investment classification

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.220
and the division of investments

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.220
into real and financial investments.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.220
Real investments are strategic decisions

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.220
that determine in the forecast plan

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.220
what capital is needed

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220
to purchase buildings,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.220
structures, machines and equipment,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.220
and what capital is needed

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.220
to create or increase stocks.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.220
Financial investments are planned

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.220
as long-term investments

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.220
in other enterprises,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.220
acquisitions of shares of another enterprise.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.220
Or we can plan short-term investments

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.220
in short-term financial securities.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.220
We plan short-term investments,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:30.220
that is, the acquisition of short-term financial securities.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.220
Accordingly, in the balance sheet, they are reflected as short-term financial investments in the second section of the balance sheet.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.220
The calculation of investment needs

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.220
includes the assessment of the necessary

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220
capital, the total cost of the necessary

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.220
equipment, machines, structures,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.220
vehicles and other assets.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.220
These calculations are calculated

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.220
in the production plan

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.220
as part of the justification

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.220
of production capacity.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.220
They are connected with the established

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.220
strategy of the enterprise

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220
and are used in the final form.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.220
The only thing we pay attention to

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.220
is the correct planning

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.220
and calculation of amortization calculations.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.220
The next component of investment

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.220
is the turnover capital.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.220
It is the most important part

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.220
of the strategic financial planning.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.220
The turnover capital

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.220
is the most important part

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.220
of the strategic financial planning.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.220
Why do we need it?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220
It is a barrier

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.220
between the perception of this concept

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.220
and the mixing of the turnover capital

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.220
with the current activity,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.220
with direct acquisition

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.220
and with the writing of raw materials.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.220
The turnover capital

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.220
should be minimally necessary

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.220
but sufficient.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.220
If we create unnecessary reserves,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.220
it will affect the efficiency

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.220
of our activities.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.220
A shortage of reserves

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.220
can lead to breakdowns.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.220
The turnover capital

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.220
should be minimally necessary

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.220
but sufficient.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.220
The situation of the turnover capital

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.220
is the absence of stock in the warehouse,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.220
the absence of a position in the trading room,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.220
the absence of fresh bread every day

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.220
or the absence of money for payment from the accounts.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.220
The importance of the turnover capital

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.220
should be remembered

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.220
because it is the main factor

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.220
that determines the value of the project.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.220
The turnover capital increases

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.220
when the enterprise develops.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.220
The reserves of the enterprise increase

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.220
and certain funds are needed.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.220
It should be remembered

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.220
that the turnover capital

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.220
can exceed the main capital

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.220
if the enterprise develops.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.220
The calculation of the turnover capital

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.220
follows the plan of revenue

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.220
and the cost-benefit ratio.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.220
We use the existing data

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.220
such as the revenue,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.220
the cost of the finished product

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.220
and the cost of the material costs.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.220
These are the main parameters

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.220
that we take from the strategic plan.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.220
We take the annual cost from the meta

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.220
and remember that we have 360 days per year.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.220
According to these data,

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.220
we proceed to the planning of the turnover capital,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.220
sequentially moving from each position

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.220
of the current assets.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.220
We start planning the reserves

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.220
The quantity of the material and the resources

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.220
depends on the supply interval.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.220
For example,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.220
if we receive materials every 10 days,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.220
it means that we have to form reserves

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.220
for these 10 days.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.220
Therefore, we take the material costs

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.220
from the cost of the finished product

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.220
and the cost of the finished product

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.220
and the cost of the material resources

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.220
and the cost of the material resources.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.220
In other words,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.220
the turnover capital

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.220
will work in the resources of the resources.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.220
The next component is the unfinished product.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.220
This is a component

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.220
that is only for production companies.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.220
For commercial companies,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.220
this is a component

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.220
that is only for production companies.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.220
depends on the production cycle.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.220
For example,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.220
we have 15 days.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.220
I will insert specific numbers

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.220
so that it is more clear.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.220
depends on the material costs

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.220
depends on the material costs

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.220
The next component of the turnover assets

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.220
is the debitor's debt,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.220
which is formed due to the fact

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.220
that we provide a delay to our buyers.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.220
Accordingly,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.220
we do not receive some part of the revenue

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.220
as much as we give a delay.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.220
As much as we give a delay.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.220
For example, 30 days.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.220
Next, we can plan

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.220
the minimum necessary remainder

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.220
of the finished product in the warehouse.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.220
of the finished product in the warehouse.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.220
For example,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.220
we have a store for 3 days.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.220
This also means

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.220
that we do not sell it immediately

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.220
and, accordingly, do not receive the revenue.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.220
All these intervals of time

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.220
are interconnected.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.220
We put here nothing but points

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.220
that make up segments of the financial cycle.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.220
All these standards work

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.220
and determine the amount of turnover capital.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.220
The more these management standards,

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.220
the more turnover capital.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.220
If we sum up the resulting component,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.220
the calculated component,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220
we get the total amount

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.220
of turnover capital

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.220
produced in the warehouse.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.220
The turnover capital is the capital

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.220
that must be invested in our stocks.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.220
the turnover capital is the capital

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.220
that must be invested in our stocks.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.220
But, of course, you immediately thought

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.220
that in addition to the fact

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.220
that we provide a delay,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.220
we are also provided with a delay.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.220
We have a credit debt

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.220
and we will pay for it 45 days later.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.220
We have a credit debt

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.220
and we will pay for it 45 days later.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.220
And for financial planning,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.220
we are interested in the amount

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.220
of net working capital.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.220
of net working capital.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.220
This is the amount

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.220
that shows us

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.220
the amount of money

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.220
that is needed for investment

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.220
together with the main capital.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.220
together with the main capital.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.220
The less the net turnover capital,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.220
the shorter the financial cycle of the enterprise.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.220
The less the net turnover capital,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.220
the shorter the financial cycle of the enterprise.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.220
The financial cycle is a normative one.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.220
It is an operational cycle

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.220
and after 45 days

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.220
we have a 13-day financial cycle.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.220
The shorter the financial cycle,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.220
the faster the turnover,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.220
the more significant the financial results.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.220
In addition to this scrupulous method

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.220
of calculating the turnover capital

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.220
by all components,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.220
we can calculate the turnover capital

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.220
by the turnover capital that has been formed.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.220
We can calculate the turnover capital

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.220
by the turnover capital that has been formed.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.220
In addition to this,

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.220
there is another method

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.220
of calculating the turnover capital

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.220
that is calculated at $100 per turnover.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.220
If we have this normative,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.220
we can multiply any planned annual turnover

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.220
by this normative

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.220
by adjusting the number of days in the period

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.220
This is a similar calculation,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.220
but here we determine

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.220
the separate costs

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.220
and the separate costs

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.220
for $100 of revenue.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.220
According to the accounting,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.220
it is easy to calculate the costs of raw materials,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.220
amortization, and other expenses.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.220
And we can set the same standards

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.220
for storing raw materials in the warehouse,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.220
the time of production,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.220
the storage of products in the warehouse,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.220
and get the total cost of stocks

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.220
and the normative of the turnover capital

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.220
for $100 of revenue.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.220
You can use any method.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.220
The point is not to forget

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.220
to take into account the need for turnover capital.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.220
This is the main problem.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.220
Why does the enterprise have no money?

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.220
This is the first problem that arises.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.220
It shows that all components are not taken into account.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.220
All components are taken into account incorrectly.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.220
The components are not thought out,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.220
or the normative was taken into account during planning,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.220
but in reality, the situation has changed

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.220
and no operational measures have been taken.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.220
I want to emphasize the importance

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.220
of calculating turnover capital.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.220
I want to emphasize that turnover capital is very mobile and variable.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.220
It is the first component that reacts to any changes

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.220
in the market or within the company.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.220
The need to calculate turnover capital

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.220
and monitor business activity

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.220
should be the basis of the work of financial services.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.220
should be the basis of the work of financial services.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.220
To monitor, it is necessary to regularly

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.220
monitor the balance of turnover funds,

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.220
monitor the warning options

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.220
and break-downs in any position.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.220
There may be problems with the suppliers,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.220
or something is not in order in production.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.220
or something is not in order in production.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.220
Or the finished product is stored in the warehouse,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.220
so it is necessary to put the marketing in order.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.220
I would like to draw your attention to the financial indicators.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.220
I would like to draw your attention to the financial indicators.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.220
These are external indicators

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.220
that easily react and show the situation

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.220
at our company.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.220
They are followed by a system of organization

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.220
of production processes,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.220
ensuring the production of products.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.220
But, of course,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.220
the head of the warehouse does not understand

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.220
what the cost of stock is.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.220
But he understands well

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.220
that the delivery interval is 10 days.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.220
Therefore, this parameter should be voiced.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.220
Unfinished production is a financial

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.220
and economic parameter for the organizers

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.220
of production.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.220
It is not clear, but 15 days

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.220
is the norm for which the head of the warehouse

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.220
or the head of the warehouse

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.220
or the head of the warehouse

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.220
is responsible for the production.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.220
This is a purely financial parameter

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.220
and requires a lot of work,

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.220
meticulous work, regular work

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.220
with suppliers and customers.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.220
This includes monitoring the reliability

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.220
of customers, the reliability of suppliers,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.220
the payment ability of customers,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.220
whether the supplier can withstand

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.220
the regularity of the delivery.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.220
And you want to provide the supplier

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.220
with goods with a payment delay.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.220
The more you provide the suppliers

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.220
with the editor's post,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.220
the longer the delay period

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.220
is, the more the cost of delivery

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.220
is.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.220
The more the cost of delivery

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.220
is, the longer the delay period

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.220
is, the longer the cost of delivery

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.220
is.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.220
The turnover is an indicator of business

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.220
activity. If business activity increases,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.220
the turnover is released.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.220
If there is a slowdown in the process,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.220
a new infusion is required

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220
in any of these components.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.220
So, we have determined how much money

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.220
will be needed to purchase equipment,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.220
how much will be needed to create

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.220
or increase the stock of turnover

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.220
for the accepted program.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.220
Now we must determine the sources

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.220
of funding.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.220
Please see the slide

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.220
with the information about the source

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.220
of funding.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.220
Please see the slide with the information

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.220
about the source

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.220
of funding.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.220
Please see the slide with the information

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.220
about the source

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.220
about the source

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:42.220
about the source

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.220
about the source

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.220
about the source

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.220
about the source

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.220
about the source

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.220
about the source

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.220
about the source

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.220
about the source

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.220
about the source

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.220
about the source

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.220
about the source

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.220
about the source

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.220
about the source

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.220
about the source

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.220
about the source

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.220
about the source

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:33.220
It is important to separate the source of capital from the external and internal sources of capital.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.220
External sources are those that come to our enterprise from outside,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:46.220
and internal sources are those that are formed during the enterprise's activities.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.220
Here is an interesting example.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.220
The accumulated profit is the component of the capital itself,

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:02.220
the so-called self-financing, the internal source of financing.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:08.220
An interesting position is the debt on taxes and fees, the internal source of financing.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.220
The effect of financing here is that these obligations are fulfilled with a certain delay.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.220
The payments of the current period are reduced.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.220
For example, the special value is the pension fund.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:26.220
This is the component of the cost of this period.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.220
It reduces the taxable profit of this period,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.220
and is reimbursed within the next 15 days.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.220
That is, within 15 days, we have some amount of funds

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.220
that will serve as a source of financing.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.220
In this case, it is short-term financing.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:56.220
A specific source of financing is the financing of the re-laying and changing of the asset structure.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.220
We are talking about amortization.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.220
As you know, amortization payments are intended to reimburse the cost of the worn-out equipment

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.220
after a certain period, after 10 years.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.220
But today, this money, together with others,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.220
can be used to finance some current needs.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:23.220
Or even to finance the development, to buy new machines, equipment,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:29.220
production areas, trading areas, without waiting for the wear of the old ones.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.220
At the moment, this allows you to increase your revenue

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:39.220
and in 10 years, to earn money for replacing the worn-out equipment.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.220
These components, the internal sources of financing,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.220
are the highest qualifications of financial management.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:55.220
Financial managers are forced to work every single penny.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.220
Amortization is used to finance the reserve payments.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.220
Debit debt is sold.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.220
This is the position of the factoring of the sources of financing.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:15.220
The division of the sources of financing into long-term and short-term is understandable.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.220
For example, the long-term source of financing is, of course, the capital itself.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.220
But the capital is divided into both long-term and short-term.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.220
The long-term source of financing is, of course, the long-term loans.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:39.220
The short-term source of financing is the debt of the creditor.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.220
Short-term financing is the most frequently discussed,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.220
more lively topic.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.220
In order to resort to short-term financing,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.220
you need to take into account the existing realities,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.220
the possibility of obtaining short-term loans, their price.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.220
In addition, there are formal requirements for bank institutions

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.220
for liquidity and turnover indicators.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.220
These conditions for providing short-term loans can change

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.220
depending on the liquidity indicators.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.220
The creditor considers liquidity indicators,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.220
identifies less or more risky borrowers,

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:27.220
and increases the loan rate depending on this analysis.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:36.220
The Russian reality today is a strict control of the amount of clean assets in the borrower's balance.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:51.220
Financial support for creditors is a very interesting and profitable article in financing.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.220
It is free financing.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.220
Here, of course, it is necessary to clearly control the payment deadlines

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.220
of the creditors and debitors.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:09.220
In order to ensure the level of the contract,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.220
we provided favorable conditions for us.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:20.220
For example, we did it in the account of the turnover capital.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.220
There were 45 days and 30 days,

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.220
which gave us 15 days of opportunity, 15 days of advantage.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.220
What else should be taken into account when we solve the issue of financing?

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.220
An important component for a financial manager

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.220
is the ability to save on tax payments.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.220
In particular, simple mechanisms.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.220
It should be remembered that interest on loans is included in the cost.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.220
However, in our realities, this is limited to the limit of the refinancing rate of 10%.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.220
This will reduce the taxable profit.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.220
You can save on tax payments by accelerating amortization.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:08.220
In general, accelerated amortization is a powerful tool for saving on taxes around the world.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.220
It acquires slightly different forms.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.220
Because a limited number of enterprises

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.220
has the opportunity to save by using accelerated amortization.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.220
In particular, leasing.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:26.220
Leasing is one of the most interesting and best laws.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:33.220
It provides that leasing payments can be increased by three times.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:39.220
In general, leasing is a powerful tool.

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:44.220
In addition to using leasing, we save on one-time costs,

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.220
on the purchase of leasing items, on the purchase of equipment.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.220
From a financial point of view, it is very important to save on taxes.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.220
Leasing payments in full, with accelerated amortization,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.220
with interest on loans, with insurance contributions,

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.220
are included in the cost.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.220
Thus, the taxable profit is reduced.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:15.220
These are the civilized ways to save on tax payments

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:20.220
within the framework of the existing laws.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:25.220
When we talk about determining the source of financing,

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:31.220
we must remember the well-known rules and principles of financing.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.220
Let's look at the principles of financing.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.220
The first one is the principle of economic value.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.220
What does it mean?

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.220
The price at which we spend our financing.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.220
The average cost of capital.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:53.220
That is, we must attract the funds that we need for financing

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.220
with minimum costs.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.220
And if we have free excess funds,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.220
we must use them in a profitable way,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.220
by investing in securities.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.220
The principle of purposeful use of funds

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.220
is associated with the so-called golden rule of financing.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.220
That is, long-term funds should be used

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.220
to purchase machines, equipment,

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.220
long-term property.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.220
And short-term sources of financing are used

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220
to finance current needs,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.220
to cover cash outages.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.220
This is a clear rule.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.220
It is actually violated at every step.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.220
And what happens?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.220
Let's take a short-term loan

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:54.220
and buy a machine, equipment.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.220
The source of repayment of loans is always

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.220
profit and depreciation.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.220
Profit is an indicator that may not exist.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.220
Depreciation is 10% per year.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.220
Compare 10% and the interest rate for a short-term loan.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.220
Let's recall the golden rule of financing.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.220
Why is it so important?

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.220
If we use short-term loans with a rate of 20%

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.220
to purchase the main funds,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.220
which have a 10% depreciation,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.220
and there is a little profit,

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.220
we are pre-claiming ourselves

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.220
to be unpayable.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.220
For the next turn,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.220
for the next snowball,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.220
we need new loans.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.220
New loans, new loans,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.220
new money.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.220
The next principle of financing is

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.220
the independence of financing.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.220
Of course, when we use loans,

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.220
we must somehow protect ourselves,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.220
minimize our risk.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.220
We also have a 50-50 rule.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.220
We measure the volume of the loan

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.220
with our own funds.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.220
Limiting the size of the business

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.220
to the size of our wallet,

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.220
as the Americans say.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.220
Let me remind you again

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.220
that the security of financing

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.220
is related to ensuring financial stability.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.220
We talked about this

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.220
and said that it is a cornerstone

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.220
of financial balance.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.220
In connection with the price of financing,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.220
the price of capital,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.220
with balancing on the verge of risk and profitability,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.220
we can give an example.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.220
Let's say the expected return on shares

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.220
of the company is 14%,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.220
and the obligation is less than 9%.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.220
What does this mean in terms of risk?

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.220
A higher return on shares

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.220
means that they are more risky

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.220
if I want to purchase shares of this company.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.220
In order to protect myself,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.220
I am not inclined to risk,

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.220
I will purchase bonds.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.220
On the management side,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.220
on the contrary,

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.220
my own financing is considered less risky,

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.220
and therefore the managers are ready

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.000
to pay a higher price for capital shares.
