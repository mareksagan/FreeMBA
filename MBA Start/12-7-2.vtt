00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Let's move on to the next question.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Why do we need to talk about warehouse equipment in more detail?

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
First, the warehouse equipment is related to the investment costs of the company, which, supposedly, decided to rent a room.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
On the other hand, depending on the function of the warehouse, the equipment of the warehouse should be different.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
You don't need to buy equipment that will increase your costs, storage and maintenance costs,

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
while being inapplicable to this type of storage.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Therefore, the main principle of the equipment is the principle of proportionality.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
What is the proportionality? First of all, the form of ownership.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Is your warehouse rented or is it something else to which you transfer services?

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Of course, the warehouse that represents the outsourcing services tries to be equipped with the latest technology.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
It is usually a type of warehouse A and B and performs all these above-mentioned functions.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
The second point is the function of the warehouse.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
If your functional purpose is a warehouse at a shopping mall, then you don't need high-rise storage.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
High-rise storage is often not needed for distribution centers.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
Several levels of storage are enough, but not necessarily 7-8 levels.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
The type of storage. Imagine a very heavy metal structure.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
It is unlikely that it will be possible to store it on shelves.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Accordingly, it is assumed that the height of the ceiling is not important here, there will be field storage.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Variants of warehouse processing of goods.

01:52.000 --> 02:11.000
If you have a small-sized product, for example, a book, then the warehouse processing of goods can be automated.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Then it is probably more profitable to transfer such a warehouse to the outsourcing specialized bookstores,

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
where special cassette storage places can be automatically completed.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Features of the cargo flow.

02:29.000 --> 02:43.000
Where the cargo flow is quite rich, where the cargo flow passes through the warehouse, you must choose various types of equipment for it.

02:43.000 --> 03:00.000
This option of vehicles, for example, a car or a road vehicle, will affect the choice of warehouse equipment.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Now let's look at some types of warehouse equipment in more detail.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
The main place of storage, except for field storage, is the storage structure.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
And, first of all, the storage structure is divided into two types.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
These are hook mounts and bolt mounts of these structures.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
What is the difference?

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
If you have a hook mount, then such a storage can be adjusted faster at different heights of stored goods.

03:36.000 --> 03:49.000
But the bolt mount of the storage already has a fairly rigid structure, which, so to speak, needs more time to be adjusted to some type of product.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Nevertheless, both options are used quite actively.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Hook mounts are mainly used in modern high-rise automated warehouses.

03:59.000 --> 04:11.000
The next type of storage, which is designed on the basis of the previous version of front pallet storage or archive storage, is mezzanine.

04:11.000 --> 04:24.000
It is assumed that mezzanine storages are organized in the upper tiers of storage after the lower tiers are filled with more permanent storage.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Accordingly, such mezzanine storages allow you to use the entire storage area more densely.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
In this case, in this photo, a separate unit of goods is stored in mezzanine in the form of small boxes.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
There may be, of course, more, but, of course, mezzanine storages can be used primarily as a components area.

04:48.000 --> 05:00.000
And in the components area, some large large pallets must already be decomposed and distributed to units of storage for artificial goods or in some boxes.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
Moreover, offices or some sub-units can be organized in mezzanine storages.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
The levels of mezzanine storages are connected to each other, as can be seen in this photo, by stairs.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
But, in principle, if there are enough of such floors of mezzanine, you can even attach a certain technical elevator.

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
In principle, mezzanine is often used in distribution centers.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The next option is console storages.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
The main purpose of these storages is to store long-term goods, both on pallets and on special packaging cassettes.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
It is important that these console storages are flexible enough in rearrangement.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
You can set the different height of the shelves and, accordingly, adjust them to a certain length of the goods that will be stored here.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, except that usually in console storages there are some technical requirements,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
which suggest that the main weight of the cargo should still be located closer to the wall,

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
or if we have such a cargo stored, so to speak, quite heavy.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
As can be seen from this photo, the approach to such console storages is possible from two sides,

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
so they somewhat resemble front storages, and, accordingly, the processing of goods here at speed will not take, so to speak, a lot of time.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
The next system and classification is loading and carrying-out deep storages.

06:35.000 --> 06:49.000
A deep storage can be imagined as a storage place, where, so to speak, you put some supplies for some non-risk purposes.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
What is the name of the loading and carrying-out?

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Basically, it is related to how the maintenance equipment passes into this storage.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Neither the other deep storage, neither the production nor the loading, can be serviced manually.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Therefore, of course, a high-lifting technique in the form of rack tracks or electric stabilizers is used here,

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
which just move pallets with cargo and fill this very storage.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
What does the filling rack mean?

07:24.000 --> 07:37.000
It means that the last unit of this cargo unit, in this case loaded with the pallet, will be loaded, supposedly, the last one.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
In order to pull out the penultimate unit from this rack, you will also have to remove this first unit.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
Therefore, the last pallet will be the first one.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Last in, first out.

07:54.000 --> 08:11.000
In this case, it is assumed that there are usually some slots here, through which the pallets can move towards the end of the rack of this structure.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
It is assumed that a technique entrance, which would, so to speak, pull out these pallets, is possible from both sides.

08:19.000 --> 08:29.000
Based on this, moving along the rollers or, so to speak, being pushed by some loading rack tracks or stabilizers,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
the pallet moves further and further into the depths.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And on the other hand, it can be accepted from the opposite side.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Therefore, the FIFO principle, first in, first out,

08:40.000 --> 08:53.000
Accordingly, the earliest pallet will eventually reach the end of this storage area, and it will be the first to be pulled out for cargo processing.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
The disadvantage of deep racks is a fairly high cost, much higher than front racks.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
Of course, such deep racks are mainly used for storage units of Groups A and B, in general, specialized in the supply of logistic services.

09:11.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, the most, so to speak, expensive are shelf racks, in the sense that they can be located in some kind of trading complexes.

09:22.000 --> 09:34.000
And their main advantage is that some small parts and cargo, some containers with this artificial product can be stored on the shelves.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
And shelf racks are used for the completion of cargo, for processing orders.

09:42.000 --> 10:01.000
And they, at least, allow workers who process orders to take goods from each cell and form an order.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
I would also like to draw your attention to the gravity of the shelves, which are essentially a means of low-mechanization.

10:09.000 --> 10:26.000
Since they have roller bars installed on the frames at an angle to the horizon, then, under the influence of gravity, if such bars are tilted a little, goods can move along these shelves.

10:26.000 --> 10:36.000
And the orderer does not have to make great efforts to remove the box, for example, from such a gravity rack.

10:37.000 --> 10:47.000
The advantage of gravity racks is essentially the same as that of deep racks.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
First, the FIFU principle. I mean deep-drain racks.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
That is, the box that was put first, it can be taken from the other end of this rack.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
Of course, these shelves can still be used for additional control over the shelf life.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
The orderer usually moves along such shelves minimally.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
Here, perhaps, the block principle of cargo storage, which gives a gain in area, high sliding of those cargoes.

11:23.000 --> 11:36.000
And, in principle, due to these additional means of low-mechanization, it is possible to reduce the errors of the order completion and, accordingly, also highlight the unloading and unloading zones of the goods.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Gravity racks are mainly used in combination with gravity conveyors.

11:44.000 --> 11:58.000
And in the completion zones, as shown on the slide, for goods of groups A and B, that is, for goods that are most in demand,

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
they are most often moved for the completion of orders.

12:03.000 --> 12:19.000
Together with such gravity conveyors, they represent the design of the order completion zone.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
I would also like to draw your attention to the docking equipment of the warehouse.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
Imagine a dock, which is actually the name of the warehouse entrance.

12:31.000 --> 12:46.000
And if, for example, the entrance to the building is supposed to have stairs, then in order for the cargo vehicles to drive well enough to this entrance to the warehouse,

12:46.000 --> 12:58.000
a ramp is usually organized there, or an inclined platform, a log lift, on which a vehicle drives in the form of a truck.

12:58.000 --> 13:10.000
It is very important to equip the place of loading, because modern warehouses, as I said, often maintain a special temperature regime.

13:10.000 --> 13:21.000
And just the ramp, on which the truck, which has arrived, stands on this inclined platform, can be subject to all winds and rains in different weather conditions.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Based on this, it is impossible to disassemble this cargo right here.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
The equipment that we have is designed to enter the warehouse, special automatic modern doors, called a dock shelter.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
They come in different types, inflatable, curtain, and pillow, as shown in our photo.

13:43.000 --> 13:51.000
The inflatable ones are more hermetic and cover this transport equipment from all sides, quite tightly.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
They can be used just for refrigerators of warehouses with a special temperature regime.

13:56.000 --> 14:08.000
The curtain ones are more versatile. It is possible that the transport equipment here is of different volumes, and the curtains are more flexible.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
And the pillow versions of such doors can be very popular.

14:13.000 --> 14:24.000
But, as you can see, they are not suitable for pallets, for moving pallets, and, accordingly, are limited in use.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
There is also a variant of special storage gates, these are high-speed gates.

14:30.000 --> 14:41.000
They are, of course, more applicable inside the premises, maintain a temperature regime, and allow you to design a warehouse with different storage areas.

14:41.000 --> 14:51.000
That is, in one warehouse you can have a storage area with a low temperature regime, or with some high temperature regime, a common storage area, and so on.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
I have already said that the ramp is a kind of lift that helps the transport equipment to enter the warehouse.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
But as soon as the car has entered the warehouse, it is assumed that the goods must be unloaded from this car.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
And, of course, you can unload manually, so to speak, by shifting these boxes on the carrier.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
But on the other hand, there is such a device as a dock leveler.

15:22.000 --> 15:37.000
That is, this is a leveling platform that allows you to align the distance between the vehicle and the means on which the overload of pallets, boxes, or some other types of products is carried out.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
There are quite a lot of them.

15:39.000 --> 15:49.000
Here is a mini-dock leveler, it is cheaper to use, hydraulically, of course, more expensive, since it involves such a more complex design.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
Another variant of storage equipment, low-mechanization, is lifting tables.

15:55.000 --> 16:05.000
I have already said that one of the principles of adequate work in the warehouse is the ergonomic working place.

16:05.000 --> 16:21.000
And here, in this case, the equipment manager does not have to bend over to the boxes when he unboxes this pallet, but it is possible to make a normal slope for loading.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
There are different options of these lifting tables, the level of lifting is also diverse.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
The most popular equipment for more or less high-rise warehouses is a warehouse stacker.

16:33.000 --> 16:43.000
It is assumed that in different variants, manual, electric, or even self-propelled, it lifts loads to different heights.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
As you can see, this is a device with a fork, a fork device.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
Accordingly, it is assumed that this stacker moves pallets or pallets in the warehouse.

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
And again, a kind of low-mechanization means allows you to move not one pallet at once, but several at once.

17:01.000 --> 17:10.000
For example, up to 3.5 tons or more than 3 tons, depending on the capacity.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
It is worth mentioning the equipment for packaging.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
We have already discussed such an example of an additional service, additional cost, as cross-docking.

17:21.000 --> 17:30.000
I said that an order comes to the warehouse, packed in stretch film.

17:30.000 --> 17:43.000
So, just the pallet packers, either for pallets, which are presented to us in the photo, or smaller stripping machines for boxes, or some manual machines.

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
They are supposed to pack the order after the order packer has completed the order, and send it to the end consumer.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
This is how such equipment helps.

17:56.000 --> 18:07.000
Another device, of course, is mainly used in large warehouses, is the order packers or concessionaires.

18:07.000 --> 18:18.000
What is the difference between it and the previous mechanisms that lifted pallets or lowered pallets from some height?

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
It is assumed that there is a certain platform, and the order packer, as shown in this picture,

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
together with this platform rises to the desired level, where he collects the goods he needs.

18:32.000 --> 18:45.000
Moreover, there is some place on this order packer, where you can lay out various types of equipment that is being packaged.

18:45.000 --> 18:55.000
The intermediate position between the pallet packer and the order packer is a ridge track.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
This is a pallet packer with a moving carriage-mast.

18:58.000 --> 19:11.000
As you can see, he has a fairly high speed of movement along the warehouse, and a high speed of lifting up to 6 meters per second, and, accordingly, a fairly decent lifting capacity.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
It can also be used quite actively.

19:15.000 --> 19:26.000
In principle, we, unfortunately, do not have more time to dwell on other types of warehouse mechanization in detail.

19:26.000 --> 19:35.000
But I would like to talk about the object that I often talk about, about the warehouse of the pallet.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
The English name is Pallet, the Russian version is Paleta.

19:39.000 --> 19:50.000
This is the horizontal loading platform on which the order type is laid.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
The pallet has a corresponding stereotype.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Euro pallets, as indicated, are 800x1200x150 mm.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Another standard version is 1000x1200x150.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
In principle, it is precisely under such a standard of the pallet that it is necessary to select the appropriate equipment.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
Under such a standard of the pallet, it is necessary to install, so to speak, a range of storage structures and everything else.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Please note that there is also a phytosanitary standard ASPM-15.

20:25.000 --> 20:32.000
This is an international quality standard that, when transported internationally, exposes special requirements for pallets.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
It is assumed that they must be subjected to either chemical or thermal treatment when designed.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
But mostly, of course, pallet manufacturers are subjected to thermal treatment.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Why? Because what is the pallet made of? It is a tree.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Accordingly, there may be some insects and bugs.

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
And when crossing the border, unfortunately, there were already such cases when these pallets were, so to speak,

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
in terms of phytosanitary standards, without compliance.

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
Accordingly, measures have now been developed by all border services that carry out phytosanitary control

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
in order to control the movement of such an international product in pallets or on pallets.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Our next topic is the design and planning of warehouses.

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
We have already discussed some of the main components related to the equipment of warehouses.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
I hope you understand that the equipment of a warehouse depends on the type of storage,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
the flow of goods, the flow of goods through the warehouse.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Now let's take a closer look at the design factors of a warehouse.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
In principle, the design of each warehouse is individual.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
And each company will decide for itself what qualities this warehouse should have,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
what is its functional purpose.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Nevertheless, all these multifactorial positions can be combined,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
and we will consider some of the design factors of the warehouse.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
First of all, is it a corporate or a general warehouse?

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
We found out that corporate warehouses are usually a specific warehouse,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
where some one-type product is usually stored,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
some conditions of storage are weak,

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
and, accordingly, it requires tightness, and so on.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
It is impossible to store various types of products together.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Therefore, such a corporate warehouse will have special requirements

22:43.000 --> 22:57.000
for floors, various types of storage racks, doors, and other temperature modes.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
The second question that should be asked to the designers is

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
what type of goods and what volume of workflow.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
Why? Because, I repeat, there may be some chemical incompatibilities of goods,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and this should be taken into account.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
The volume of workflow greatly affects the design area,

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
what should be the zones of long-term storage, short-term storage,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
or some intermediate storage zones,

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
if your workflow is related, for example, to cross-docking.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
The speed of the implementation of this product,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
the frequency of selection of goods, and so on,

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
will certainly require not only the allocation of special zones in the warehouse,

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
but also the appropriate equipment and hiring of appropriate workers.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
What type of warehouse?

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Is it a storage warehouse or a distribution center?

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
I have already said that this will affect the level of warehouse mechanization.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
The picture shows the processing station of the order,

24:09.000 --> 24:19.000
which allows the scanner, using various computer software,

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
to form an order with sufficient accuracy.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Of course, if your warehouse performs both functions,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
that is, it is a storage warehouse and a distribution center,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
then you need to think about how to maximize the use of the warehouse area

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
and organize the mezzanine zones for the order.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
Moreover, modern mezzanines allow the movement of some equipment at certain levels.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
So, as you can see, the planners face a dilemma.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Three tasks are needed – space, mechanization, personnel.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
All these objects of planning, space, mechanization, and personnel,

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
will result in some costs.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
If we want to maximize the use of the warehouse area

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
and assume a special storage zone,

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
then, most likely, we will need to use the appropriate mechanisms.

25:27.000 --> 25:37.000
If the personnel is hired to this warehouse to save time and processing,

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
and you will have a manual processing of the order,

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
then this can affect the costs of the personnel's labor,

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
and may even have a negative impact on the quality of the order.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
What other additional factors of planning the warehouse I would like to note?

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
First, the permanent or variable place of the order.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
If you have automated warehouses,

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
then each type of product requires a permanent storage place,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
because it is included in the program.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
These transport devices that take the goods from the corresponding shelves

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
work with the permanent storage places.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
But if you have a permanent storage place,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
and this type of product is still missing,

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
or if you have a permanent storage place,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
for example, organized by type of brands,

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
then the shelves are being placed, and the useful area is being placed.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
But on the other hand, automation, as seen from the previous diagram,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
is a function that we perform,

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
and the processing times of orders are being performed quite normally.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Horizontal or vertical placement.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
As soon as the height of the warehouse increases,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
the requirements for special equipment are being issued,

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
which will process the most complex pallets of high-rise storage.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
On the other hand,

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
given that the squares, especially in the cities, are quite expensive,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
the increase in the warehouse floor area

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
reduces the costs of long-term investment,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
namely, the construction of the warehouse.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
Based on this, new warehouse complexes are usually considered

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
as the A-class complexes.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And here, in this diagram, in these photos,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
the horizontal and vertical placement of the warehouses is presented.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
A one-story warehouse is supposed to have floor storage,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
and, of course, it probably corresponds to this,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
and high-rise storage, as shown in this diagram,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
is already necessarily supposed to have some kind of transport equipment,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
in particular, here is a lift.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
In general, the planners of the warehouse have a dilemma

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
about what to choose, the area or the time.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
If the warehouse is oriented to the processing of orders,

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
then, of course, the choice will be preferable in favor of saving time.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
If the warehouse is designed for longer storage,

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
then, probably, the preference will be given to the area.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Although, often, these components cannot be satisfied at the same time.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
For example, saving time.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
In order to save time, we should have special areas for the completion of orders

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
and replenishment of the stock of goods for this intermediate completion.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Thus, there will already be three areas in the warehouse.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
The area of long storage, the area of replenishment of the stock,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and also the area of completion.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
The territory of the warehouse, in this case, is not saved,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
but time is saved,

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
because the component will be able to perform its functions faster.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
The economy of space.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Here is the main goal of storage.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Then we highlight these areas from our project.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
And on one site, just according to the schedule,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
different types of work are carried out at different times.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
Again, this is not possible if the flow is rich enough.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
If the flow of cargo that is to be processed is small,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
then, of course, it is possible to break the schedule operations

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
and carry them out on the same territory.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
For example, we can have active and reserve stocks for the economy of time.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
What does this mean?

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
Again, this is all a discussion about the completion area.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
Why? Because the component goes to the active stock area at once,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
and the cargo is processed there.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
The economy of space implies the presence of some minimum reserve stocks.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
But if the reserve stock is minimal,

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
then there should be some areas under the bunkers in the processing area of the order,

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
where the necessary products will be stored for the order.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
That is, every time we have to calculate this project individually,

30:28.000 --> 30:35.000
depending on the flow of work and the amount of cargo that is processed.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
The optimal option is, of course, automatic order compiling lines,

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
which are presented by the fast track conveyor system,

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
which in this case helps to form orders.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
The components are located along this conveyor,

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
and these boxes are delivered to them for cargo processing.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Here is another question.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Two loading platforms or one?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
This is again a question of saving space and time.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
The linear option is our top scheme.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
It is assumed that unloading and loading take place from different platforms.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Accordingly, the machines do not interfere with each other,

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
and the people who process these orders do not interfere.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
But, of course, space is not saved here.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Only time.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
U-shaped. This option saves us space.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Unloading and loading take place from one gate.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
In this case, the class of this warehouse is immediately reduced.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It is somewhere from class C.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
But unloading and loading take place according to schedule.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Of course, if your flow of goods is not so large,

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
then you can fit into the schedule and thus provide this warehouse.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
You can also highlight such private factors as intensive or highly mechanized work.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
Of course, highly mechanized work will increase the accuracy of processing,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
but it will also increase the costs.

32:18.000 --> 32:27.000
Accordingly, the price of labor and costs for automation or mechanization must be weighed every time.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
If low-paid employees work in your warehouse,

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
you will probably choose manual labor.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
If the flow of work is so large and requires such accuracy that you have a lot of mistakes,

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
then you will probably prefer a mechanized type of warehouse.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Space for passages or racks.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
In the application for the lecture, I suggest you consider a case

32:57.000 --> 33:03.000
where designers try to reduce the space for passages,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
increasing the length of the racks, and increasing the useful storage area.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Indeed, the useful storage area will be increased.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
But what will be difficult here?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The processing time will be increased.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
The next factor of planning is the system of compiling of warehouses.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
We also talked a little about this.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
This is a scheme of a person to a product or a product to a person.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
The first option, when the compiler moves along the racks,

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
assumes the presence of various transport and loading means,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
in particular, automated commissioners.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
But the scheme of goods to a person assumes that the compiler is already stationary,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
and the goods are delivered to it.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
In this case, it is quite likely that additional equipment,

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
such as various types of conveyors, will be needed.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
What other additional factors could be considered?

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Corporate warehouse or a place in the general use warehouse?

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
Taxes are added here,

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
the peculiarities of contractual relations with the owners of the warehouse when renting the territory,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
the questions about hiring workers, and so on.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Are the services of the cross-docking applied?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
We talked about this in detail.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
If it is a one-stage cross-docking,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
the trucks will be like a reserve zone,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
and if it is a two-stage cross-docking, then a reserve storage zone is needed.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
A paperless or a documented warehouse?

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
A paperless warehouse gives a more accurate account of the flow of goods.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
A fast location of one or another product saves time.

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
But a paperless warehouse certainly requires costs for various mechanization tools,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
such as a counting device,

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
and variants of radio markers, for example, which are marked on some cargo.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
If we consider the principal schemes of the warehouse,

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
based on everything that we have discussed,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
we have already found at least three zones.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
The zone of receiving goods, the zone of storage, and the zone of unloading.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
The ideal option is that the zone of receiving and unloading

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
is located at different ends of the cargo flow,

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
and it is ideal that the goods move linearly.

35:35.000 --> 35:44.000
This type of warehouse corresponds to the long-term storage warehouse.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
If this scheme of the warehouse is closer to the distribution center,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
then additional zones appear.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
In addition to the zone of receiving, the zone of unloading,

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
the zone of complementation and the zone of consolidation appears.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
In the zone of complementation, there is an intermediate storage of the individual goods,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
and in the storage zone there can be pallets and boxes.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
And in the zone of consolidation, there is a repackaging of the cargo and then unloading.

36:13.000 --> 36:24.000
All these zones require special equipment and special variants of racks.

36:24.000 --> 36:32.000
What else can affect the plans for placing products and racks in the warehouse?

36:32.000 --> 36:43.000
First, you can assess the flow of goods by the logistic marketing method ABC or XYZ.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
What does this mean?

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
Group A goods are goods that are transported most often by warehouse and are required by the consumer.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Group B goods are goods that are transported less often, but C is quite rare.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Accordingly, you place this product in the warehouse,

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
Group C goods will be placed in a far box, and Group A goods will be placed at hand.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
Next, there may be a requirement from the consumer stores,

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
which require to place goods in the orderly order in the distribution center,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
in which they are placed on the shelves of the store.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Of course, this is a kind of additional value service.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
But this service reduces the processing time of goods and, accordingly, the costs.

37:27.000 --> 37:39.000
Even the documents from such a store will be in accordance with the order of these shelves in the store and on the warehouse shelf.

37:39.000 --> 37:48.000
There may be an option to optimize the batch of goods,

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
multiple, for example, single goods, goods in a box or a pallet.

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
Accordingly, you need to choose the equipment that will serve different types of goods.

38:01.000 --> 38:11.000
For example, you have one box of ketchup, a whole pallet of paper towels,

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
and several boxes of other products.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
All this together will need to be somehow completed and have different storage areas for them.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
In this case, it will be a storage area for pallets, one for the storeroom,

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
and, accordingly, various forked conveyors that will transport all this.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
It will be a storage area in boxes,

38:40.000 --> 38:49.000
since, as I said, some products are forbidden to us in terms of the volume of the box.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Or maybe even a single product.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
In this case, this store may not need so many knives,

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
and it will take this amount of equipment in each order.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Next, the storage area for mixed storage.

39:06.000 --> 39:15.000
This is also an option when logistics providers offer you various storage options,

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
such as a refrigerator and a dry storage area.

39:20.000 --> 39:28.000
Or, as I gave you an example, a bakery store,

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
where at the same time there is a deep freezer and a storage area.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
This will certainly affect the layout of the warehouse.

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
Thus, there are quite a lot of factors, and they all need to be taken into account.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.000
To summarize our discussion, we could highlight several stages of decision-making when designing a warehouse.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
The first stage is, of course, marketing.

39:55.000 --> 40:04.000
You should assess the approximate demand for materials and the flow of work for the next five years.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
This is a long-term plan, but if you decide to spend money on the organization of storage areas soon,

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
then you need to assess the demand for materials and the flow of work for the next five years.

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
Then, the daily flow of materials through the warehouse is designed.

40:23.000 --> 40:30.000
The third stage is to compare the available equipment for cargo processing

40:30.000 --> 40:39.000
and choose the equipment that suits your type of warehouse, such as racks and so on.

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
The fourth stage is to determine the type of product for each type of warehouse.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
Because you work for a specific type of customer, not just a warehouse for unknown purposes.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
The place for storing each unit of product is determined,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
by type, size, dimensions, and so on.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Then the layout of the warehouses is determined.

41:04.000 --> 41:15.000
We must analyze the physical characteristics and take into account the demand in the ABC method,

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
take into account some physical properties in terms of temperature storage,

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
values, for example, of the storage safety option,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
requirements for separate storage of products,

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
and for each product type, determine the corresponding storage area.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.000
The seventh stage is to summarize all this material,

41:36.000 --> 41:43.000
and we form a general storage scheme for cargo processing based on modeling.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
When this model is created, it is necessary to clarify the details.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
Various groups of experts and employees are involved,

41:53.000 --> 42:00.000
and the final project and final development plan are chosen.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
In conclusion, I would like to say about the general principles of functionalization of warehouse planning.

42:06.000 --> 42:18.000
These principles of functionalization are available for the organization of any warehouse.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
The first principle is to ensure a continuous material flow.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
It is assumed that there should be no lags in equipment,

42:26.000 --> 42:34.000
no lags in employees, and no lags in vehicles that serve this warehouse.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
The next point is to simplify the number of movements,

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
and, accordingly, some types of movements should be combined,

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
and some types of movements in the warehouse should be reduced.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
It is possible to introduce high-rise storage or save space due to mezzanine storage.

42:55.000 --> 43:02.000
There is a recommendation to place offices outside the main working area of the warehouse or at least in the mezzanine,

43:02.000 --> 43:11.000
since such offices do not save space in the warehouse and make it difficult to work.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
It is necessary to take into account the space under the roof,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
and if possible, it is in this area, in the space under the roof,

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
that it is possible to organize the movement of materials and even their processing.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
The optimal places for passages should be developed.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
They should be narrow enough to save space,

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
but wide enough so that the equipment you have chosen can pass through them

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
and process the cargo at a sufficient speed.

43:42.000 --> 43:49.000
And the last principle is to develop such a warehouse layout,

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
so that there is a unidirectional linear movement of goods and cargo,

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
so that neither the suppliers of orders nor those who transport these cargo batches

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
between the various areas of the warehouse do not return.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Conclusion

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to two ways of developing the warehouse system.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
There is a special management direction called the management of the company's development.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
And, as you know, there are two ways.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
The first is a revolutionary or an e-strategy,

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
which involves engineering, automation.

44:36.000 --> 44:43.000
The revolutionary methodology of reforming and changing the warehouse requires large capital investments,

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
modernization of all processes, organization of all this.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
And the second option is an evolutionary or an e-strategy.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
This option is the most interesting for us in terms of organizational management,

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
because it assumes that you have already analyzed the existing resources

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
and are trying to organize them correctly and rationally,

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
perhaps by adding small means of small mechanization, computerization of processes,

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
since this is an integral requirement of modern work of any organization,

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
not only of warehouse systems and warehouses.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
So, let's see how the first, very short, way of automation,

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
as well as the e-strategy or the development of organizational factors of such warehouse systems.

45:36.000 --> 45:44.000
First of all, I would like to draw your attention to the automatic warehouses of vertical and horizontal type.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
What is it?

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
In this case, it is assumed that within the framework of reengineering of the warehouse,

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
you have generally abandoned low-level warehouses, so to speak,

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
or with manual processing, completely revolutionary reengineering was introduced,

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
you have abandoned capital assets, sold them, and bought new equipment,

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
created new automatic warehouses of vertical and horizontal type.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
As you can see, all the advantages are associated with various options of automation.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
Automation of the loading and extraction operation, the absence of errors,

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
since you have computerized information processing,

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
the control of the life expectancy due to the automated system.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Accordingly, you do not need to carry out inventorying,

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
it is carried out in automatic mode, the minimum number of workers,

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
the exclusion of the so-called human factor, the factor of laziness or other problems with labor.

46:54.000 --> 47:02.000
And, of course, a high degree of control and the flexibility of warehouse management is carried out in such a warehouse.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
But I will return to one more idea.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
Such a warehouse is quite expensive, because all the equipment here is automated.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Examples of an automatic warehouse.

47:13.000 --> 47:20.000
As we can see in the picture, where is the option of pallet storage,

47:20.000 --> 47:28.000
and this is a high-level warehouse, and it is operated by a vertical stabilizer,

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
and this is an automatic stabilizer, it automatically selects the necessary pallets.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
In another photo, an automated system with a high-altitude stabilizer is presented,

47:41.000 --> 47:47.000
and here is a small storage, medium-sized goods,

47:47.000 --> 47:57.000
such cells where you can select this product in automatic mode.

47:57.000 --> 48:06.000
You can read more about various options for the automation of the warehouse in the lesson application,

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
but I would like to draw your attention to how this automatic warehouse is built.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
Look, here the rack design is not inserted into empty spaces,

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
it is immediately a carrying skeleton of such a warehouse.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
That is, it is immediately built as a high-altitude storage warehouse.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
And then these rack designs are faced right on the foundation,

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
and these warehouses can reach 40 meters,

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
and various options of pallet processing and artificial processing are possible in such warehouses.

48:40.000 --> 48:47.000
But for small, let's say, in terms of the volume of types of goods,

48:47.000 --> 48:54.000
imagine pencils, pens, notebooks, screws, screws, and so on,

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
there can be automatic modular warehouses.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
Such a module in the form of such a cabinet, box, is installed inside the room of a normal warehouse,

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
and inside there is a cassette storage, and again, complete automation,

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
you can set the program for the formation and selection of goods.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
This process automatically helps to implement such a modular warehouse.

49:20.000 --> 49:25.000
Now let's consider the improvement of the warehouse work based on organizational solutions.

49:25.000 --> 49:34.000
You have already understood that organizational solutions for each type of activity should be specific,

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
but we can highlight some general questions of the organization here.

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
First of all, based on the forecast, it is necessary to develop a strategy for organizational work of the warehouse.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
That is, what is it for, what are the goals of its work.

49:49.000 --> 49:57.000
Then it is desirable to introduce such a strategy for constant improvement of work in the organizational plan.

49:57.000 --> 50:03.000
And for this you need to constantly collect feedback from employees,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
if you want to organize quality cups,

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
and within the framework of such a practice of constant meetings,

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
meetings in which the issues of the quality of processing of products were raised,

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
to implement this strategy for constant improvement of work.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
The next component of the organizational work of the warehouse is the improvement of staff management.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
Of course, there are issues of staff health, if you want, staff age,

50:32.000 --> 50:41.000
the payment system, how it should be, and the convenience of workplaces, ergonomics.

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
Accordingly, the more ergonomically convenient the workplace, the less load the staff experiences,

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
and, accordingly, the higher its productivity.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
As an example, let's say, of the wrong organization of the work of the workplace.

50:55.000 --> 51:05.000
Unfortunately, you can bring the work of such a conveyor shop when assembling at our Russian car factories,

51:05.000 --> 51:13.000
when the assembler had to constantly, for example, to install the windshield,

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
climb a step 40 cm high.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Accordingly, he was very tired, made mistakes, did not have time for the conveyor.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
The same negative principle can be presented in the warehouse,

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
when, for example, the order-maker has to climb a step or a small step to reach the top shelf,

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
which is also needed for the order.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
Of course, this will reduce the option of processing the flow of goods in this warehouse.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
Current operational control is required.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
Such formalized checks are formalized in the sense that they must be accurately specified,

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
the criteria according to which the work is considered to be of high quality or low quality,

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
that is, the terms, the number of errors.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
The more clearly specified in the framework of this operational control the options of error in the work,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
the better the work will be organized.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
It is also necessary to find out the possibility of the use of cross-docking,

52:12.000 --> 52:21.000
since such a variant of the warehouse work saves work time on the warehouse costs,

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
on the disbursement, repackaging of goods,

52:24.000 --> 52:31.000
and at the same time gives the opportunity to perform such a service and receive a certain share of profits.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
Next, it is necessary to control the placement of goods at the request.

52:35.000 --> 52:43.000
Of course, the groups A and B should be closer to the order-forming zone,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
and the other groups should be somewhere further.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Next, you should get rid of unnecessary and unusable property for work,

52:49.000 --> 52:57.000
because it does not contribute to the increase in productivity of the work,

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
but only clogs the warehouse and does not give the opportunity to organize either a storage area on the same territory,

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
or to spend money on more progressive equipment.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
It is necessary to concentrate resources on the work that brings the most profit.

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
In this case, you should define the competence zone of your warehouse,

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
and it is on these types of activities that human and technical resources should be concentrated.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
It is necessary to introduce the principle of integration.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Of course, this is not possible everywhere.

53:32.000 --> 53:39.000
Not every warehouse can be built into a rigid technological chain and receive a significant profit from it.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
But, let's say, you can agree with the supplier within the framework of the principle of integration,

53:45.000 --> 53:52.000
at least in the sense that the vehicles that bring you some product,

53:52.000 --> 53:59.000
the trucks loaded inside the vehicle can correspond to the order of shelves,

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
storage places in your warehouse, which makes it easier to disassemble the cargo.

54:05.000 --> 54:15.000
The last principle to pay attention to is the rational use of existing information technology.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
Of course, in a small warehouse, you can work with a modern program and DOS,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
manually, on paper, make some changes.

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
But modern information technology presented on the Russian market is quite rich,

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
and you can use less expensive, less expensive,

54:34.000 --> 54:42.000
if you have a large flow of goods and options of services.

54:42.000 --> 54:50.000
But any information technology significantly increases the productivity of the warehouse.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
The truth is that it is necessary to agree here.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
Just the equipment and the information provided separately do not give results

54:59.000 --> 55:06.000
if you do not work with the personnel and do not fulfill all the previous points that I have already mentioned.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
If we consider the principle of moving cargo and storage,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
it can also be rationalized.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
First, we need to speed up the process of transporting goods,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
thereby increasing the cargo turnover.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
For example, the maximum number of pallets should be transported.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
What is this often associated with?

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
For example, a worker carrying goods on his truck

55:27.000 --> 55:34.000
can not receive a ton of cargo, but a number of trips.

55:34.000 --> 55:40.000
As a result, each pallet is transported separately,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
earning checkboxes for the salary,

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
but there is no optimal cargo turnover.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
Therefore, this very loading technique must be used in the appropriate areas.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
It is unlikely that where you can get around with a cart,

55:57.000 --> 56:06.000
you need to use an electric loader that requires large costs to provide it.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Now, as for the selection of goods and the selection of orders.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
Here, again, the first thing to do is to use different types of racks.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
I remind you that these can be various racks using, for example,

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
the force of gravity and, accordingly, facilitating variants of unloading.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
Next, there must be a dynamic cargo selection channel.

56:28.000 --> 56:37.000
After all, a warehouse well-provided by the flow of work should have a packaging area.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
And it is imperative to have a scheme of the location of goods in the warehouse,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
which corresponds to the ABC principle.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
It is necessary to select the variants of the selection technique,

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
to process all orders at the same time on one type of goods.

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
I mean, again, an example with New Year's gifts.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
It is not necessary to go for each candy of a different type for one gift at different times.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
It is enough to take this, so to speak, variant of candy or, for example, cookies,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
and put them in each gift at the same time.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
At the same time, several orders are formed at once.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
You save time and movement.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
Accordingly, it is more correct to organize the selection of orders in batches.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
And, of course, goods that are in low demand,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
and, accordingly, the flow of these goods is small,

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
there is absolutely no need to move all over the territory of the warehouse.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.000
It is more profitable to organize the selection of these goods directly at the storage sites.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
The last question concerns the rationalization of the reception, packaging and unloading.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
First, the first proposal here is to use inexpensive conveyors without electric drives,

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
on which the cargo is moved due to the weight.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
The second point, which is now necessary to use in all warehouses,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
is to use barcodes.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
And, accordingly, the allocation of special storage places,

58:14.000 --> 58:20.000
in which goods are stored, also equipped with barcodes,

58:20.000 --> 58:27.000
and you can read the type of product that is there at the expense of the scanners.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
Draw up a schedule for the delivery of goods from the dock of the receiver.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
If you have a system of U-shaped docking options.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
Use the most productive cargo indexing systems,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
namely, barcodes,

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
a device, for example, for weight checking,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
for the identity of the assortment,

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
which helps to accurately calculate the number of individual goods in the package.

58:54.000 --> 59:00.000
And reduce the number of goods that are selected to a maximum.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
In particular, if you select goods in some boxes,

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
then this option can be used as a final packaging.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
To summarize the course presented,

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
I would like to draw your attention to the planning and organization of the warehouse individually.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Each project requires careful elaboration.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
Nevertheless, the solution to the problems is quite possible

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
due to the principle of proportionality,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
the selection of adequate racks,

59:41.000 --> 59:47.000
equipment, and personnel for your warehouse.

59:47.000 --> 59:56.000
And the solution to the problem of constant improvement of work within the framework of operational management.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Then, in principle, even a less equipped warehouse will be in a more working condition.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Let me finish my story.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Thank you for your attention.
