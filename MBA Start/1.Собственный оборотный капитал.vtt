00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Today we will talk about our own turnover capital.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
First of all, you remember that capital can be both private and borrowed.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
In this case, we will talk only about our own capital, not about the capital that is attracted to the enterprise.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
Secondly, all capital can be represented as the main and the turnover.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
As you remember, the main capital is the hard-to-realize assets,

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
such as land, buildings, infrastructure, equipment, non-material assets and other basic resources.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
We have already talked about this part of capital in the previous topics.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Today we will talk about the turnover part of capital.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
The turnover part of capital is the hard-to-realize assets, such as reserves,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
debit debt, short-term financial investments and money.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
You remember that all these parts of capital are represented in the left part of the balance sheet,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
where we have the assets.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
The turnover part of capital takes up a large share of the enterprise.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Each has its own share, but in general, their share is quite large.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
This is the most mobile part of capital,

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
and the state of this part of capital depends on the results of the enterprise's economic activity

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
and the financial state of the enterprise.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
It is very important for the enterprise to know whether it has turnover capital,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
what state it is in, and how it works.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
The state of the enterprise's own turnover capital depends on the stability of the financial state of the enterprise.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
It depends on the optimal distribution of funds at the stage of the process of turnover.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
The process of turnover includes the supply of the enterprise,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
then production and finally the production surplus.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
At each stage of the process of turnover there are their own turnover funds.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
The financial state of the enterprise depends on the optimal distribution of their shares at the stages of the process of turnover.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
If the state of the enterprise is not optimal, it starts to go crazy.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
At the optimal distribution, the enterprise feels great.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
At the first stage, where the supply is, there are the reserves.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
The reserves are a very important part of the asset.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
At the stage of production surplus there is the debt and cash.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
This is how the enterprise's own turnover funds are distributed at the stages of the process of turnover.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
As we can see, the financial state depends on the distribution of the funds at the stages of the process of turnover.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
It is impossible to find the optimal state and say that all enterprises should adhere to it.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
The size of the investment in each stage of the process of turnover depends on the enterprise's distribution characteristics.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
There are enterprises that require a lot of material reserves,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
where the material production is concentrated to a very high degree.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
There are enterprises with a long production cycle, where the largest part is in the unfinished production.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
Thus, depending on the enterprise's distribution characteristics, the distribution of the funds will be one way or another.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
If you want to know whether the distribution of the funds of your enterprise is optimal,

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
you need to look at the optimal distribution of the funds for the enterprise that belongs to your enterprise.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Then you can compare your enterprise with this optimal distribution.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
The turnover assets can be distributed depending on their liquidity level.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
You should remember that the balance of assets is based on the liquidity level,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
that is, on the speed of their transformation into monetary form.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
The higher the liquidity level, the faster it is transformed into monetary form,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
the lower the line is in the balance of the enterprise.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
The slowest, fastest and most liquid assets are the reserves of the finished product,

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
the raw materials and the unfinished production.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
The whole warehouse is full of reserves that are needed for production.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Today we will talk about this separately, specifically about the reasons for the need of reserves for the enterprise.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Today, at this moment, we are only saying that the reserves are related to the slow-releasing assets.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Moreover, some reserves can be so slow-releasing that they become non-liquid.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
The fast-releasing turnover assets are the debt and the funds on the deposits.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
The debt, as you remember from our previous lectures,

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
are the funds that other enterprises owe us.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
First, there are contractual relations, according to which the terms of the return of the debt are determined.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Second, each enterprise is actively working to return the debt,

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
so the debt is returned to the enterprise more or less quickly.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
This is why it is related to the fast-releasing turnover assets.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
The funds on the deposits are dependent on the enterprise.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
The enterprise deposits the free funds on the deposit accounts in the banks.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
It can deposit them or not, depending on the purpose and the need of the enterprise.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
The enterprise can't deposit the funds at the moment,

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
or they need to be saved for the near future, and they deposit them on the deposits.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
But you should remember that the deposits are temporary deposits,

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
so they can't be taken back at any moment.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
If you need the funds at any moment,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
you should not deposit them, but leave them on your account.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Then you can use them at any time, any day.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
The most liquid turnover assets are the funds and the short-term market securities.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
The short-term market securities are the funds,

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
so it is a given that you need to turn them into money.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
In some cases, it can be a foreign currency,

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
which can be transferred to any other country, including the Russian currency.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
But it will take some time.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
The short-term market securities are also an interesting document.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
You can quickly turn them into money if the term of their termination is approaching,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
or if you have a need to get rid of them and turn them into money.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
You can also divide the assets into stable and unstable ones.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
The stable assets are the main assets and some of the turnover assets,

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
which are at an unchanging level during the year.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
Some of the assets change their form during this period,

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
and some of them remain unchanged.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
The ones that remain unchanged are called stable assets,

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
and the rest of the assets are called unstable assets.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
The unstable assets are represented by the passive assets.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
The passive assets are the sources of the enterprise's funds.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Depending on the source of the funds,

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
the passive assets are divided into the own and the borrowed ones.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
The banks, other enterprises, and their partners

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
take the assets on the market.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
In any case, they are not the enterprise's assets.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
They are taken for a certain period of time,

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
and the enterprise's assets are the loans and loans.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
The short-term assets include the loans,

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
the debt, and some of the loans and loans

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
that will be taken during this period.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
It is very important for an enterprise to manage its assets and passives correctly.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
What does it mean to manage them correctly?

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
As we know from previous lectures,

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
the assets and passives are characterized by certain periods of their use.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
The main thing is that the time should match.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
The time period of the transition from one form to another should match.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
The time period of tracking the time period,

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
the coordination of the assets and passives,

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
and the coordination of the assets and passives.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
If we imagine a complex management system,

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
it includes the transformation of the current financial needs

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
into a negative amount so that the enterprise can work

11:39.000 --> 11:47.000
and manage the assets and passives.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
Now we will look at the steps of complex management.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
We will see how the enterprise uses them,

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
which of them is more important,

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
and how the enterprise uses them.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
First, we should look at the current needs.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
The enterprise needs to purchase stocks,

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
and other financial resources to cover the current needs.

12:37.000 --> 12:45.000
The enterprise uses various sources of money,

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
but among them we can distinguish a certain sequence of use of funds.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
First of all, the enterprise uses its own money.

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
Why? Because it is free, it is already its own.

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
It does not need to pay for anything,

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
it can use its own money.

13:25.000 --> 13:33.000
In any case, business does not allow to relax,

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
but nevertheless, it is the least evil.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
What can you do if you do not have enough money?

13:49.000 --> 13:57.000
It is not a big deal,

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
but the use of money is a sign of effective management.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
The second thing is the creditors' debt.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
The creditors' debt is what you owe to your partners.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
For example, they gave you the raw material for the production,

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
but you did not have to pay for it.

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
You did not have to pay in advance,

14:45.000 --> 14:53.000
you did not have to pay in cash.

14:53.000 --> 15:01.000
The easiest way to use the creditors' debt is to pay for the raw material.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Of course, it is not free,

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
but you have to remember that the raw material is free only in the mining industry.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
What if you do not even have enough creditors' debt?

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
What if there are cash-out breaks,

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
but you do not have enough money?

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
The creditors' debt is what you owe to your partners.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
The enterprise starts to contact the bank

15:53.000 --> 16:01.000
to get the cash for a short period of time.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
It is not more than one year.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
It is a short-term loan.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
It is a short-term loan.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
It is not a loan from the bank,

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
but a loan from another business partner.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
It is a loan.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
We talked about it in the previous lectures.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
If we need short-term loans,

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
we can use the sources of their payment.

16:57.000 --> 17:05.000
Different sources have different colors in terms of the benefit of their use.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
Some are more beneficial, some are less.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
We need to know the difference.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
The relationship between a businessman and the world is not only a contractual one,

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
but also a human one.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
The most beneficial sources of short-term loans are the ones from the creditors.

17:37.000 --> 17:45.000
Everyone in the business is doing it.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
It is a norm.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
It is a normal phenomenon.

17:57.000 --> 18:05.000
It does not cause any tension between the businessmen.

18:05.000 --> 18:13.000
The second source is the payment of the money from the employees.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Pay attention.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
The form of payment is very specific.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
It is called the delay of the salary of the employees.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
The businessman does not pay the salary in time.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
The money is used for the business.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
The employees of the enterprise are the ones who lend money to the businessman.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
It is a free form of payment.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
I have never met a businessman who would pay the salary in time

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
with the interest of his employees.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
It is a free form of payment.

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
It is not a payment from the commercial credit,

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
or from the bank loan.

19:29.000 --> 19:37.000
The salary of the employees cannot be increased to infinity.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
The employees are ready to suffer the delay of the salary

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
in order to make the enterprise better.

19:53.000 --> 20:01.000
But they are not ready to never receive the salary.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
Even if the businessman does not pay the salary,

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
the situation at the enterprise deteriorates.

20:17.000 --> 20:25.000
The current staff is increasing.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
The employees are getting better.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
The employees are more interested in the payment of the salary

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
than in the return of the active participation in the production process.

20:47.000 --> 20:55.000
The businessman risks to be left alone at the enterprise.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
He does not have any plans.

21:01.000 --> 21:09.000
Sooner or later he stops using this source.

21:09.000 --> 21:17.000
This source exists, but it is limited.

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
It is a life-saving circle that can be used for a short time.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
If you know that your situation at the enterprise will improve,

21:33.000 --> 21:41.000
you will be able to recover your situation.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
There is another source.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
It is a tax payment.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
The state does not pay the taxes in time.

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
The state is a machine that does not tolerate the lack of repayment.

22:09.000 --> 22:17.000
The state demands the payment of taxes.

22:17.000 --> 22:25.000
The state also demands the payment of fines.

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
If the profitability of the business is not higher than the fines,

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
then it is better not to use this source.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
If the business is very profitable,

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
then it is better not to use this source.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
The state understands that it will have to pay more fines.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
This is a good source for short-term money.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
The money could be used to increase the stock.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
Everything that is excessive is not good.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
There should be an optimal amount of stocks at the enterprise.

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
The excess of stocks is not used.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
It is a dead weight.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
The frozen capital is not used.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
It is needed for other purposes.

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
The excess of stocks is harmful.

24:09.000 --> 24:17.000
The enterprise should make sure that it does not have excess stocks.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
We will talk about this later.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
The enterprise should have an optimal amount of stocks.

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
There should be a lot of capital dead weight,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
but not enough stocks.

24:43.000 --> 24:51.000
There is no small component.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
The car is not a complete car.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
There should be stocks, but not too much.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
The next negative aspect is the excessive payments.

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
The enterprise receives the goods from the suppliers,

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
and we are part of the chain.

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
We provide the goods to the suppliers.

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
The business is set up in a way that the goods are provided

25:45.000 --> 25:53.000
to us in the form of goods.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
The most important thing is not to provide the goods,

26:01.000 --> 26:09.000
but to not violate the optimal amount.

26:09.000 --> 26:17.000
If you start to provide the goods too much,

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
you will lose the turnover.

26:25.000 --> 26:33.000
You will have problems that you do not need.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Each enterprise decides for itself

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
what payment to make to its partners.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
It is a threat to the partners.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
If you cannot make your products,

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
it is not a threat to the enterprise.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
Payment is not a gesture of charity.

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
The market should be the same as your competitors.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
If your competitors provide goods,

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
you should provide them too.

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
But you should not provide goods without limits.

27:39.000 --> 27:47.000
You should provide goods in a limited amount.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
If we sum up all the needs of the enterprise,

27:55.000 --> 28:03.000
we will get the current financial needs.

28:03.000 --> 28:11.000
The current financial needs are equal to the amount of reserves

28:11.000 --> 28:19.000
plus the debitory debt.

28:19.000 --> 28:27.000
You need reserves and a debitory debt

28:27.000 --> 28:35.000
to provide the goods to your partners.

28:35.000 --> 28:43.000
The current financial needs are equal to the debt

28:43.000 --> 28:51.000
to your partners.

28:51.000 --> 28:59.000
The two important things are the needs

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
and the help provided by the market.

29:07.000 --> 29:15.000
The enterprise is interested in reducing its reserves.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
We have already said that it is not profitable

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
to reduce the reserves.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
But it is not less than the optimal value.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
The optimal value causes a failure in the enterprise.

29:43.000 --> 29:51.000
The loss is the benefit from the reduction.

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
The enterprise is interested in reducing its debt.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
The enterprise is not profitable.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
The debt is a state of necessity.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
It exists only in the market.

30:23.000 --> 30:31.000
It is not profitable to reduce the debt.

30:31.000 --> 30:39.000
But it is not interested in excessive debt.

30:39.000 --> 30:47.000
It is not interested in excessive debt.

30:47.000 --> 30:55.000
The enterprise is interested in increasing its credit.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
It is a great idea to live in a business

31:01.000 --> 31:07.000
where everyone is lending you money.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
But you are developing without using your own money.

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
The enterprise has its limits.

31:23.000 --> 31:31.000
You are not being credited for charity.

31:31.000 --> 31:39.000
If you don't get a loan,

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
you are not being credited for charity.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
The debt is a debt that you have to pay back.

31:55.000 --> 32:03.000
You can't increase the debt forever.

32:03.000 --> 32:11.000
You can't increase the debt forever.

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
You are not getting the money for free.

32:19.000 --> 32:27.000
You are paying for it.

32:27.000 --> 32:35.000
You are paying for it.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
You are paying for it.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
You are paying for it.

32:49.000 --> 32:57.000
You are paying for it.

32:57.000 --> 33:03.000
You are paying for it.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
You are paying for it.

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
The enterprise has a number of factors.

33:19.000 --> 33:27.000
The longer the production process,

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
the more money is in the form of assets.

33:35.000 --> 33:43.000
The longer the production process,

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
the more money is in the form of assets.

33:51.000 --> 33:59.000
The longer the production process,

33:59.000 --> 34:07.000
the more money is in the form of assets.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
The longer the production process,

34:15.000 --> 34:23.000
the more money is in the form of assets.

34:23.000 --> 34:31.000
The production process should be minimized.

34:31.000 --> 34:39.000
The production process should be minimized.

34:39.000 --> 34:47.000
The businessmen are interested in selling the product as soon as possible.

34:47.000 --> 34:55.000
The businessmen are interested in selling the product as soon as possible.

34:55.000 --> 35:03.000
The businessmen are interested in selling the product as soon as possible.

35:03.000 --> 35:11.000
If you don't have the finished product,

35:11.000 --> 35:19.000
you lose your partner.

35:19.000 --> 35:27.000
If you don't have the finished product,

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
you lose your partner.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
You should have as much finished product as possible.

35:43.000 --> 35:51.000
You should have as much finished product as possible.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
You should be happy to see your partner.

35:59.000 --> 36:07.000
You should be happy to see your partner.

36:07.000 --> 36:15.000
You should be happy to see your partner.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
You should be happy to see your partner.

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
The growth of production is influenced by the growth of demand.

36:31.000 --> 36:39.000
The higher the growth of production,

36:39.000 --> 36:47.000
the more money you should invest in the production.

36:47.000 --> 36:55.000
The higher the growth of production,

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
the more money you should invest in the production.

37:03.000 --> 37:11.000
The higher the growth of production,

37:11.000 --> 37:19.000
the more money you should invest in the production.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
It requires additional finances.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
The seasonality of production is also influenced.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
Modern business is seasonal.

37:37.000 --> 37:45.000
The harvest is seasonal.

37:45.000 --> 37:53.000
The harvest is seasonal.

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
The seasonality of production is also influenced.

38:01.000 --> 38:09.000
Construction work is seasonal.

38:09.000 --> 38:17.000
Construction work is seasonal.

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
Construction work is seasonal.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
Construction workers have no money for construction.

38:33.000 --> 38:41.000
Construction workers have no money for construction.

38:41.000 --> 38:49.000
They should save money for the summer and for the spring.

38:49.000 --> 38:57.000
The production of clothing is seasonal.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
The production of clothing is seasonal.

39:05.000 --> 39:13.000
The production of clothing is seasonal.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
The clothing industry is adjusted to the season.

39:21.000 --> 39:29.000
The clothing industry is adjusted to the season.

39:29.000 --> 39:37.000
The industry works unevenly for a year.

39:37.000 --> 39:45.000
The industry works unevenly for a year.

39:45.000 --> 39:53.000
The industry works unevenly for a year.

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
The seasonality of production is also influenced.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
The season of buying a flat is also influenced.

40:09.000 --> 40:17.000
There is a period of vacations when the sales of a flat are slow.

40:17.000 --> 40:25.000
After the vacations, the sales of a flat increase.

40:25.000 --> 40:33.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

40:33.000 --> 40:41.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

40:41.000 --> 40:49.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

40:57.000 --> 41:05.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

41:05.000 --> 41:13.000
The production of a flat is seasonal.

41:13.000 --> 41:21.000
The company has a liquidity gap.

41:21.000 --> 41:29.000
The company has to foresee the liquidity gap.

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
The company has to foresee the liquidity gap.

41:37.000 --> 41:45.000
The state of the industry is also influenced.

41:45.000 --> 41:53.000
The state of the industry is also influenced.

41:53.000 --> 42:01.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:01.000 --> 42:09.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:09.000 --> 42:17.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:25.000 --> 42:33.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:33.000 --> 42:41.000
The industry is not on the island.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
The state of the industry is also influenced.

42:49.400 --> 42:57.400
There are going to be a new products that will be more and more popular.

42:57.400 --> 43:05.800
If the fashion state is not monitored,

43:05.800 --> 43:13.800
people will stop buying it.

43:13.800 --> 43:21.800
The market needs to be in a good condition.

43:24.200 --> 43:28.200
In addition to the above mentioned factors,

43:28.200 --> 43:32.200
the current financial needs are also affected by the added value norm.

43:32.200 --> 43:38.200
More precisely, the need of the enterprise to meet the added value norm.

43:38.600 --> 43:44.600
It is clear that each enterprise would like to make as much profit as possible

43:44.600 --> 43:48.600
and, accordingly, to have as much added value as possible.

43:48.600 --> 43:54.600
But, there are two ends of the stick.

43:54.600 --> 43:58.600
On the one hand, in order to get more added value,

43:58.600 --> 44:02.600
the enterprise should try to sell the product at a higher price.

44:03.400 --> 44:09.400
The same value would, of course, provide a high added value norm.

44:09.400 --> 44:13.400
But, a higher price for the product that is produced by the enterprise

44:13.400 --> 44:17.400
requires the enterprise to take additional measures.

44:17.400 --> 44:23.400
First, it is not enough to increase the price for the produced product.

44:23.400 --> 44:29.400
One of the options is to move to an oligopoly or a monopoly.

44:30.200 --> 44:34.200
If you are a monopolist, then you increase the price

44:34.200 --> 44:38.200
and it is easier to implement it, because you have no competitors.

44:38.200 --> 44:42.200
If you are an oligopolist, and you have three to five main competitors in this industry,

44:42.200 --> 44:48.200
you have to enter into a conspiracy to become a monopolist through a conspiracy

44:48.200 --> 44:54.200
and, due to this, to achieve a higher added value norm.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
But, the elasticity of the product also plays a role.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
Do you remember our first lecture?

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
We talked about the elasticity of the product.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
If the product is not elastic, for example, salt,

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
then the price increase does not affect the ability to implement the product.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
You sell the same amount of product as before, but at a higher price.

45:21.800 --> 45:27.800
If the added value norm increases, the enterprise feels euphoria from the additional profit.

45:27.800 --> 45:31.800
But if your product is elastic,

45:31.800 --> 45:35.800
and it is more and more elastic,

45:35.800 --> 45:39.800
then the price increase is not a good condition.

45:39.800 --> 45:45.800
The thing is that if you are not a monopolist or an oligopolist in a state of conspiracy,

45:45.800 --> 45:49.800
then the price increase leads to the fact that consumers stop buying this product,

45:50.600 --> 45:54.600
but buy the product from your competitors,

45:54.600 --> 45:58.600
who did not increase the price.

45:58.600 --> 46:02.600
In order to get more profit,

46:02.600 --> 46:06.600
you should not increase the price,

46:06.600 --> 46:10.600
but decrease it, but increase the volume of the produced product.

46:10.600 --> 46:14.600
When we talk about the added value norm,

46:14.600 --> 46:18.600
we are talking about the price increase.

46:19.400 --> 46:23.400
The price increase is good for non-elastic products,

46:23.400 --> 46:27.400
or for elastic products,

46:27.400 --> 46:31.400
but which are still produced by monopolists or oligopolists.

46:31.400 --> 46:35.400
Then, due to these economic forms,

46:35.400 --> 46:39.400
the product itself becomes non-elastic.

46:39.400 --> 46:43.400
And it is possible to sell it in the same amount,

46:43.400 --> 46:47.400
but at a higher price.

46:48.200 --> 46:52.200
If you are not a very large enterprise,

46:52.200 --> 46:56.200
and you cannot be a monopolist or an oligopolist,

46:56.200 --> 47:00.200
but you are in a competitive environment,

47:00.200 --> 47:04.200
you should remember that the price increase

47:04.200 --> 47:08.200
is not the only way to get profit from the business.

47:08.200 --> 47:12.200
You can reduce the price,

47:12.200 --> 47:16.200
reduce the added value norm,

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
and the added value norm will increase.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
If you are not an oligopolist or a monopolist,

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
do not despair.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
The main thing is to increase the volume of the produced product.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
Then you will live perfectly,

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
without increasing the price.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
To cover the current financial needs,

47:45.800 --> 47:49.800
the enterprise needs financial resources.

47:49.800 --> 47:53.800
Where does the enterprise get the financial resources

47:53.800 --> 47:57.800
to meet its needs?

47:57.800 --> 48:01.800
We have already said that the best financial resources

48:01.800 --> 48:05.800
are the ones that are owned by the enterprise.

48:05.800 --> 48:09.800
But if the enterprise does not have enough of them,

48:09.800 --> 48:13.800
and if it does not have enough of the credit debt,

48:14.600 --> 48:18.600
then it goes to the financial market

48:18.600 --> 48:22.600
and gets the financial resources from the market

48:22.600 --> 48:26.600
in the form of a loan or a bank loan.

48:26.600 --> 48:30.600
I remind you again that a loan is getting financial resources

48:30.600 --> 48:34.600
from the same business partners as you,

48:34.600 --> 48:38.600
and a loan is getting financial resources from the banks.

48:38.600 --> 48:42.600
We have already talked about this many times,

48:43.400 --> 48:47.400
but I will repeat it again.

48:47.400 --> 48:51.400
A loan or a bank loan is a way to cover the current financial needs.

48:51.400 --> 48:55.400
We are talking about short-term financial needs,

48:55.400 --> 48:59.400
so we are talking about short-term loans or bank loans.

48:59.400 --> 49:03.400
In addition to these,

49:03.400 --> 49:07.400
there is an opportunity to issue a VEXL.

49:07.400 --> 49:11.400
These enterprises are often used.

49:12.200 --> 49:16.200
A VEXL is a very convenient form of short-term financing.

49:16.200 --> 49:20.200
You issue a VEXL yourself,

49:20.200 --> 49:24.200
you do not have to go to any financial institution.

49:24.200 --> 49:28.200
There is a law that regulates the content of the VEXL,

49:28.200 --> 49:32.200
what should be indicated in the VEXL.

49:32.200 --> 49:36.200
The form of the VEXL is determined by you,

49:36.200 --> 49:40.200
so that you can write the VEXL on a clean piece of paper.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
The VEXL should be issued,

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
but the most important thing is that it is accepted.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
When you are allowed to take a VEXL instead of money,

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
you are using the reputation of a reliable business partner.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
You are trusted, and you are allowed to take a VEXL instead of money.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
A VEXL is an urgent payment that you promise to return.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
You are not allowed to take a VEXL,

50:09.800 --> 50:13.800
but you can return it after a certain period of time.

50:13.800 --> 50:17.800
You receive a VEXL and return the money with the interest rate.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.800
If you are a reliable business partner,

50:21.800 --> 50:25.800
you will be allowed to take a VEXL.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.800
If you are not reliable,

50:29.800 --> 50:33.800
you will not be able to use such a form of attraction.

50:34.600 --> 50:38.600
You can use Factoring instead of VEXL.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.600
It is a new form of financing,

50:42.600 --> 50:46.600
new in the Russian market.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.600
It is not used in the world.

50:50.600 --> 50:54.600
Factoring has been used in all countries for a long time,

50:54.600 --> 50:58.600
but in the Russian market it is a new form.

50:58.600 --> 51:02.600
It is used in the world for a long time,

51:03.400 --> 51:07.400
but not all companies use it.

51:07.400 --> 51:11.400
Not all companies use it.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.400
Not all companies use it.

51:15.400 --> 51:19.400
Not all companies use it.

51:19.400 --> 51:23.400
It is important to talk about it,

51:23.400 --> 51:27.400
because Factoring has a serious future.

51:27.400 --> 51:31.400
What is Factoring?

51:32.200 --> 51:36.200
You can imagine when you should contact it.

51:36.200 --> 51:40.200
Factoring is used by production companies,

51:40.200 --> 51:44.200
who produce products

51:44.200 --> 51:48.200
and then transfer them to consumers

51:48.200 --> 51:52.200
in the form of a commercial loan.

51:52.200 --> 51:56.200
But a company cannot extend a commercial loan to infinity,

51:56.200 --> 52:00.200
because it has a fixed limited amount of money.

52:00.200 --> 52:04.200
A company cannot extend a commercial loan to infinity,

52:04.200 --> 52:08.200
because it has a fixed limited amount of money.

52:08.200 --> 52:12.200
If a company wants to develop its production,

52:12.200 --> 52:16.200
it has to increase the amount of goods in the form of a commercial loan.

52:16.200 --> 52:20.200
It needs money.

52:20.200 --> 52:24.200
If all the easier forms are used,

52:24.200 --> 52:28.200
and they cannot be used,

52:28.200 --> 52:32.200
then a company can use a special form of loan.

52:32.200 --> 52:36.200
But it is not provided by banks.

52:36.200 --> 52:40.200
But it is not provided by banks.

52:40.200 --> 52:44.200
Banks participate in it.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.200
Banks participate in it.

52:48.200 --> 52:52.200
Factoring companies are created by banks.

52:52.200 --> 52:56.200
Factoring companies are created by banks.

52:56.200 --> 53:00.200
A company provides a commercial loan

53:00.200 --> 53:04.200
and transfers the documents to a factoring company.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.200
A company exchanges the debt

53:08.200 --> 53:12.200
a company has to cover the debt.

53:12.200 --> 53:16.200
a company has to cover the debt.

53:16.200 --> 53:20.200
Thus, a company gets the money

53:20.200 --> 53:24.200
it needs to cover the debt.

53:24.200 --> 53:28.200
A company can use this money for further production.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.200
A company does not have to wait for the return of money from its trading partners.

53:32.200 --> 53:36.200
Trading partners can get a very long term loan,

53:36.200 --> 53:40.200
but a company gets the money right away.

53:40.200 --> 53:44.200
But a company gets the money right away.

53:44.200 --> 53:48.200
It is very convenient.

53:48.200 --> 53:52.200
But you have to assume that all the convenience is not free.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.200
If you receive money from a factoring company,

53:56.200 --> 54:00.200
you have to pay it.

54:00.200 --> 54:04.200
You have to pay a bank a percentage of its credit.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.200
The same goes for factoring companies.

54:08.200 --> 54:12.200
You have to pay a certain fee for the services it provides.

54:12.200 --> 54:16.200
So, if you receive money from a bank or a factoring company,

54:16.200 --> 54:20.200
So, if you receive money from a bank or a factoring company,

54:20.200 --> 54:24.200
all the services are not free.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.200
There is a certain fee for them.

54:28.200 --> 54:32.200
The bank percentage is even less than the factoring percentage.

54:32.200 --> 54:36.200
Therefore, a bank loan is always taken earlier than a factoring loan.

54:36.200 --> 54:40.200
Factoring is the use of money.

54:40.200 --> 54:44.200
A bank provides money to a factoring company,

54:44.200 --> 54:48.200
and the factoring company provides it to you.

54:48.200 --> 54:52.200
You pay a bank a percentage of its credit,

54:52.200 --> 54:56.200
and a factoring company a percentage of its credit.

54:56.200 --> 55:00.200
Therefore, factoring is more expensive than a bank loan.

55:00.200 --> 55:04.200
Therefore, factoring is more expensive than a bank loan.

55:04.200 --> 55:08.200
But we have already said that we have taken all the bank loans.

55:08.200 --> 55:12.200
Banks do not give us more money,

55:12.200 --> 55:16.200
so we had to turn to a factoring company.

55:16.200 --> 55:20.200
We have to pay for the services.

55:20.200 --> 55:24.200
But the question is,

55:24.200 --> 55:28.200
is a credit or factoring company profitable?

55:28.200 --> 55:32.200
The answer is simple,

55:32.200 --> 55:36.200
but we have to fixate it.

55:36.200 --> 55:40.200
The thing is that there is a profitability of a business.

55:40.200 --> 55:44.200
How profitable is it to do business?

55:44.200 --> 55:48.200
The profitability of a business should be higher than the percentage you pay for the factoring.

55:48.200 --> 55:52.200
The profitability of a business should be higher than the percentage you pay for the factoring.

55:52.200 --> 55:56.200
In this case, if this condition is met,

55:56.200 --> 56:00.200
it is profitable for you to use the factoring.

56:00.200 --> 56:04.200
Therefore, no matter how much you take the factoring,

56:04.200 --> 56:08.200
the result will be profitable for you.

56:08.200 --> 56:12.200
This is the delta that arises between the profitability of your business

56:12.200 --> 56:16.200
and the percentage you have to pay for the use of the factoring.

56:16.200 --> 56:20.200
This is the result of your financial operations.

56:20.200 --> 56:24.200
This brings additional income to the company.

56:24.200 --> 56:28.200
But if a businessman has a business that is less profitable

56:28.200 --> 56:32.200
than the percentage you have to pay to the bank or a factoring company,

56:32.200 --> 56:36.200
then it is not profitable to use these funds.

56:36.200 --> 56:40.200
Because you will pay more for these funds than you will get from using them in the business.

56:40.200 --> 56:44.200
Therefore, before you go to the bank or a factoring company,

56:44.200 --> 56:48.200
you need to look at the profitability of your business

56:48.200 --> 56:52.200
and compare it with the percentage you have to pay for the use of the factoring.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.200
And this is the result of your financial operations.

57:06.200 --> 57:10.200
And, finally, I would like to make a small but very interesting remark.

57:10.200 --> 57:14.200
For small and medium-sized enterprises,

57:14.200 --> 57:18.200
there is a unique feature.

57:18.200 --> 57:22.200
It is so unique that it is a sin not to know about it.

57:22.200 --> 57:26.200
The fact is that these enterprises can build their business

57:26.200 --> 57:30.200
in such a way that they can not even imagine

57:30.200 --> 57:34.200
that they will be able to build a business in such a way

57:34.200 --> 57:38.200
that they will have a negative impact on the system of their financial needs.

57:38.200 --> 57:42.200
That is, they will have more money than they need.

57:42.200 --> 57:46.200
Do you remember that in our formula we said

57:46.200 --> 57:50.200
that the current need is determined by the need for reserves

57:50.200 --> 57:54.200
and the debt of the debitor and the minus of the reserve of the debt of the creditor?

57:54.200 --> 57:58.200
In this way, the system of financial needs

57:58.200 --> 58:02.200
is built in such a way that it is not profitable to use it.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.200
And if the creditor's debt exceeds the debitor's and the reserve,

58:06.200 --> 58:10.200
then you get into a unique situation

58:10.200 --> 58:14.200
when you have to borrow more money than you need to borrow from others.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.200
Can you imagine?

58:18.200 --> 58:22.200
Then you are in a situation

58:22.200 --> 58:26.200
when you work exclusively with the help of the creditors.

58:26.200 --> 58:30.200
And this is a very interesting situation.

58:30.200 --> 58:34.200
You work exclusively with the help of creditors.

58:34.200 --> 58:38.200
And you did not specially borrow them.

58:38.200 --> 58:42.200
This is the situation on the market.

58:42.200 --> 58:46.200
You work in a situation when you are constantly credited.

58:46.200 --> 58:50.200
And in this situation you can be in for a very long time.

58:50.200 --> 58:54.200
This is an amazing situation.

58:54.200 --> 58:58.200
Therefore, small and medium-sized enterprises should strive to get into it.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.200
Because the reserves of raw materials give more money than you need

59:02.200 --> 59:06.200
to carry out the production process

59:06.200 --> 59:10.200
and issue a commodity loan to your customers.

59:10.200 --> 59:14.200
This is an amazing situation.

59:14.200 --> 59:18.200
I wish every businessman who is watching this lecture

59:18.200 --> 59:22.200
to be in such a state.
