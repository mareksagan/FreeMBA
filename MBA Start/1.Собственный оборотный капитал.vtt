00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today we will talk about our own turnover capital.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First of all, you remember that capital can be both private and borrowed.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this case, we will talk only about our own capital, not about the capital that is attracted to the enterprise.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Secondly, all capital can be represented as the main and the turnover.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
As you remember, the main capital is the hard-to-realize assets,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
such as land, buildings, infrastructure, equipment, non-material assets and other basic resources.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We have already talked about this part of capital in the previous topics.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Today we will talk about the turnover part of capital.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The turnover part of capital is the hard-to-realize assets, such as reserves,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
debit debt, short-term financial investments and money.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You remember that all these parts of capital are represented in the left part of the balance sheet,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where we have the assets.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The turnover part of capital takes up a large share of the enterprise.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each has its own share, but in general, their share is quite large.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the most mobile part of capital,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the state of this part of capital depends on the results of the enterprise's economic activity

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the financial state of the enterprise.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is very important for the enterprise to know whether it has turnover capital,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
what state it is in, and how it works.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The state of the enterprise's own turnover capital depends on the stability of the financial state of the enterprise.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And, first of all, it depends on the optimal distribution of funds at the stage of the process of the turnover.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You know that at the stage of the process of the turnover,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the supply of the enterprise is included, then production, and finally, the production surplus.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And at each stage of the turnover, there is its own turnover capital.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The financial state of the enterprise depends on the optimal distribution of their shares at the stages of the turnover.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If the state of the enterprise is not optimal, it starts to go crazy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
At the optimal distribution, the enterprise feels great.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
At the first stage, where the supply is, there are reserves.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is a very important part of the asset.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
At the stage of production surplus, there is a debt and cash.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is how the enterprise's own turnover capital is distributed at the stages of the turnover.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The financial state of the enterprise depends on the distribution of the funds at the stages of the turnover.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It is impossible to find the optimal state of the enterprise and say that all enterprises should adhere to it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The size of the investment in each sector of the turnover depends on the sectoral characteristics of the enterprises.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There are enterprises that require very large material reserves,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
where material production is concentrated to a very high degree.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There are enterprises with a long production cycle, where the largest part of the production is unfinished.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thus, depending on the sectoral characteristics of the enterprise, the distribution of the funds will be one way or another.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you want to know whether the distribution of the funds of your enterprise is optimal,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
you need to look at the optimal distribution of the funds for the sector that belongs to your enterprise.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then compare your enterprise with this optimal distribution.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The turnover assets can be distributed depending on their liquidity level.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You should remember that the balance of the assets is based on the liquidity level,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that is, on the speed of their transformation into monetary form.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The higher the liquidity level, the faster it becomes monetary form,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the lower the line is in the balance of the enterprise.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
The turnover assets are divided by liquidity level into slow-to-achieve, fast-to-achieve

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and the fastest-to-achieve or the most liquid assets.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The slow-to-achieve assets include the reserves of the finished production, raw materials and unfinished production.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Whole warehouses are filled with the reserves that are needed for production.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Today we will talk about this separately, specifically about why the reserves are needed for the enterprise.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We are only saying that the reserves are related to the slow-to-achieve assets.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Moreover, some reserves can be so slow-to-achieve that they become non-liquid.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The fast-to-achieve turnover assets include the debt and the funds on deposits.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The debt, as you remember from our previous lectures,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is the funds that other enterprises owe us.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
First, there are contractual relations, according to which the return of the debt is determined.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Second, each enterprise is actively working on the return of the debt.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Therefore, the debt is returned to the enterprise more or less quickly.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
The funds on deposits are dependent on the enterprise.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The enterprise deposits the free funds on the deposit accounts in the banks.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It can deposit them or not, depending on the purpose and the need it has.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
If it has money, it cannot deposit it now,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
or it needs to be saved for the near future, it deposits it on the deposits.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But you should remember that the deposits are temporary.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They cannot be taken back at any time.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You agree with the banks, you specify the time for which you cannot use these funds.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If you need the funds at any time, you should not deposit them,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but leave them on your account, and then use them at any time.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The most liquid turnover assets are the funds and short-term market securities.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The funds already exist, so to say that they need to be converted into money is a certain condition.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They already exist on your account.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
In some cases, it can be a foreign currency, which can be converted into any other currency,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
including the Russian currency.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It will take some time, though.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Short-term market securities are also an interesting document.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You can quickly convert these securities into money if the term of their termination is approaching,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
or if you have a need to get rid of them and convert them into money.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You use them to get a certain percentage of these securities.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Assets can also be divided into stable and unstable.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Stable assets are the main assets and some of the turnover assets that are at an unchanged level during the year.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
As you remember, the year is a period during which the accounting period is held.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Some forms of assets change their form during this period, and some remain unchanged.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Some remain unchanged, and the rest of the assets are called unstable assets.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
They change their form.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In addition to assets, you should remember that passives are also represented in the balance sheet.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Passives are the sources through which the enterprise funds are formed.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Depending on the source of the formation, passives are divided into their own and borrowed ones.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Remember that the own ones are those that belong to the enterprise,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and the borrowed ones are those that the enterprise borrows from the market.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Banks, other enterprises, commercial partners, in any case, these are not its funds.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000
They are taken for a certain period, and after a certain period they should be returned to those who own them.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Passives include their own funds and long-term loans and loans.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
These are permanent passives.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
A short-term passive includes short-term loans and loans,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and some of the long-term loans and loans that will be issued during this period,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that is, during the year.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It is very important for an enterprise to manage assets and passives correctly.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
What does it mean to manage them correctly?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
As we know from previous lectures,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
assets and passives are characterized by certain periods of their use.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Assets should be replenished in order to function properly.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Passives are the sources that replenish and form assets.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The most important thing here is that the time should match.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That is, the period of time when one form moves to another should match.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This period of time, tracking of this period,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the coordination of assets and passives will represent the operational management of assets and passives.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If we imagine a complex management system,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
it includes the transformation of the current financial needs into a negative amount

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in order to ensure that the enterprise can function steadily due to the funds it has,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the acceleration of the turnover of funds in the enterprise,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and the choice of the appropriate type of policy of operational management of the current assets and passives.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Next, we will look at all these stages of complex operational management.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
We will consider how the enterprise uses them,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
which of them is more important, which is less important,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and what should be the main emphasis in your business.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So, the first stage is the transformation of the current financial needs into a negative amount.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
First, we should say what the current needs are and how they are covered.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
The enterprise constantly needs to purchase stocks,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
to implement the production process,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and every day it needs to cover certain financial expenses.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Where to get the money to cover these current needs?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000
In fact, the enterprise uses various sources of money,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but among all these sources, it is possible to highlight a certain sequence of means of using to cover the current needs.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
First of all, the enterprise uses its own money.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Why? Because they are free, they are already its own.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000
No one needs to borrow them, you don't have to pay anything for them,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
you don't have to worry about their return,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
you just need to use your own money effectively.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
In any case, business does not allow to relax,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but nevertheless, it is the least evil.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I would even say that it is not evil, but a kind of good news in terms of using money.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, in the first place, the enterprise always uses its own money.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And what to do if you don't have enough of your own money?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It may be that there is nothing wrong with it,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it is bad only if you are overly involved in borrowing money,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but the small use of borrowed money, moderate use of borrowed money,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is, on the contrary, a sign of effective management of the enterprise's finances.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
In the second place, if you don't have enough of your own money,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
you can get a creditors' debt.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
A creditors' debt is what you owe to your partners.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
They provided you with the means to pay off your debt.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
For example, they provided you with raw materials from which you will continue to produce products.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But you were provided with raw materials with a payment deadline.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You didn't have to pay for it right away, you didn't have to make a prepayment,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
you didn't have to pay in fact, you were given a payment deadline.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
During the deadline period, you got a creditors' debt.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You got reserves that you can use and that you don't spend your own money on.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is the simplest, easiest form of using borrowed money.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Of course, it's not free, although you may not have to pay interest on the contract.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You should remember that free raw materials can only be found in a mousetrap.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:20.000
In any case, the price of raw materials is already set for the interest for using the means you get.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But what if even a creditors' debt is not enough?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000
What if there are cash outages that need to be covered, but there is not enough money for them?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What should you do? Then the enterprise uses short-term lending.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The enterprise starts to contact the bank in order to get the borrowed money for a short period of time and then use it.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
As you remember, the short-term lending in the modern banking system of Russia is not more than one year.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Perhaps, the short-term lending is less, like overdraft loans, which can be up to a month.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
In any case, it's short-term lending.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Perhaps, short-term loans.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
As you remember, the loan differs from a credit because you borrow money not from the bank, but from another business partner.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
He lends you his short-term funds.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It's a loan.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And if you lend them to the bank, it's a credit.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
We talked about it in the previous lectures.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
You remember it well, I just reminded you a little bit about it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So, if we need short-term lending, we can use one or another source of their income.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Different sources have different colors in terms of the favorability of their use.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Some use it more favorably, others use it less favorably.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It's an emotional color, but you should know it, because the relationship between a businessman and the world is not only a contractual relationship, but also a relationship painted with human emotions.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:37.000
The most favorable sources of short-term lending, as we said, are commercial loans from suppliers.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Everyone in the business is doing it today, those who trade, who supply raw materials.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It's a norm of business.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So, using commercial loans, increasing the credit debt, is a normal phenomenon.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It doesn't cause any tensions that can exist between businessmen.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
The second source is receiving money from their employees.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I want to draw your attention to the specificity of this form of money, which is used in our country.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
This form is called a salary delay for employees.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:41.000
A businessman doesn't pay his salary on time, and the money is used for business, for the period of salary delay.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
It's the employees of the enterprise that are currently lending to the businessman.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The peculiarity of this form is that it's absolutely free, because I haven't met a single businessman who would pay his salary with interest for a non-temporary payment.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:26.000
So, it's a free form of credit, unlike commercial loans, where it's invested in the price, or bank loans, where it's expressed in the interest rate.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But on the other hand, the salary debt can't be increased to infinity.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The thing is that the employees went to work for the sake of receiving the salary, and they are ready to suffer for some time from not receiving the salary,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
in order to make the enterprise better, to make it work better, and to improve their relations.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
But they are not ready to never receive the salary.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So, there are certain limits.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Even if a businessman managed to not pay his salary for some time, the situation at the enterprise worsens.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
The staff is shrinking, because not everyone is ready to work without money.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
The staff is shrinking.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The employees are losing their jobs, the less qualified ones are coming, the employees are more nervous,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
people are more interested in the payment of the salary, than in the return of the active participation in the production process.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Anyway, this source is limited in time, because there is a period when people agree not to receive the salary,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
and after that period, the businessman risks being left alone at the enterprise, which, of course, is not part of his plans.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
So, sooner or later, he stops using this source.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:22.000
So, this source, even though it exists, and, unfortunately, it is used, is quite limited.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So, this is the life-saving circle, which can be used for a very short period of time,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
if you know that your situation at the enterprise will improve, and you will restore your situation,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
because this is what the employees hope for, when they agree to suffer for some time without the payment of the salary.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
There is another source.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Another source is the debt payment.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
The state's taxes were not paid in time.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
There is a stick in two ends.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
On the one hand, yes, you received the money, which you can use,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
but on the other hand, the state is a machine that does not tolerate the lack of repayment of debts.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.000
The state, in any case, demands the payment of taxes, and, moreover, will impose fines on their payment.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Therefore, if the profitability of the business is not higher than the fines that the state has to pay for the short-term payment of taxes,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
then it is best not to use this source.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And only if the business is extremely profitable and the profitability of the business is very high,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
then the enterprise is entitled to pay taxes.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
At the same time, it understands that it will still have to pay more fines,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
but to some extent it has to do it, because it has no other means.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000
This is what we referred to as a favorable source of short-term money.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
But there is also a negative one.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
The money could be used to increase the stock excessively.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Everything that is excessive is not good.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000
There should be an optimal amount of stocks at the enterprise, optimal for optimal work.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
An excessive stock is not used.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
The excess of stocks is not used, it is a dead weight, and the capital is frozen.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
The frozen capital is not used, and most importantly, it is needed for other purposes.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
You could use it as a borrowed capital if you need to pay for it, you need to return it.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Therefore, excessive stock is harmful for the enterprise.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And the enterprise should strictly ensure that it does not have excess stocks.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
We will talk about this today, when we talk about stocks and determine the optimal amount of stocks.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
But at this moment you should understand that the enterprise should have an optimal amount of stocks.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
There is a lot of capital freezing, and there is a lack of stocks.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
There is a rhythmical violation.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Imagine an auto-vacuum that produces a car, and there is everything, but no steering wheel.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
This car cannot be sold, this car cannot be further promoted in the production chain.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
There is not a single small component.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
The car is considered to be unassembled.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Therefore, in order not to violate the production chain, there should be stocks.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
But again, the optimal amount.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:19.000
The next negative point that can be associated with the use of turnover capital is the provision of excessive payments to clients.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The fact is that both our enterprise receives goods loans from the suppliers of raw materials,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and we participate in this trade chain, we ourselves provide goods loans to those who buy our goods.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Today, the business is arranged in such a way that a lion's share of the goods that move in the trade chain is provided with a payment in the form of a goods loan.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
We are provided with raw materials, and we provide our products to those who buy from us.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000
The most important thing here is not what the goods loan is providing, but not to violate its optimal amount.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Do not make the provision excessive.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Because if you start to provide excessive payment in the amount or for a very long time, you will lose your turnover capital.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
You will have problems that you do not need.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Therefore, each enterprise independently decides for itself what kind of payment delay to make to its partners.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Without a payment delay, there is a risk of losing a partner in general.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
This is also very bad.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If you can not implement your product, it does not matter that you do not release it.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
It does not matter that the enterprise has stopped.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Therefore, the payment delay should be given, because if you do not provide it, your competitors will provide it.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Payment delay is not such a gesture of charity.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
This is the current situation of the market.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
You need to be the same on the market as your competitors.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
If your competitors provide goods loans in a competitive struggle, you have to provide it.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Therefore, we assume that any enterprise will and must provide goods loans.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
But it should not provide it without restrictions.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
To the right and to the left, in an unlimited amount, for an unlimited time.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It will simply lose its money.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Everything should be in moderation.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
If we sum up all the needs of the enterprise, which arises in it at the current time,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
we will get the current financial needs.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:15.000
From what we have just discussed, it is clear that the current financial needs are equal to the sum of reserves

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
plus the debt.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
That is, you need reserves for production and you need a debt to provide goods loans to your partners.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
These are your needs.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
These are two quantities.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And what reduces your current financial needs?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:45.000
The debt is the amount of credit that you have provided to your trading partners.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Therefore, this amount should be reduced.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
This is the saving circle that your partners provide to you.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
There are two very important assumptions in this formula.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
On the one hand, we see the need that is determined by your business.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
On the other hand, the help that the market provides to you, based on the market situation.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Hence, the interests of the enterprise.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
For example, the enterprise is interested in reducing its reserves.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
We have already discussed that the enterprise is absolutely not profitable to reduce its reserves.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It is profitable to reduce them, but not below the optimal value.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Because reducing them below the optimal value causes failures in the enterprise's operation.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And failures are losses.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
That is, the benefit from reduction is leveled off by the loss from failures.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Therefore, the enterprise tries never to reduce the value of its reserves below the optimal value.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
The enterprise is interested in reducing its debt.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Of course.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
There is no special meaning in giving your own funds to your trading partners.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Business is not charity.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000


00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Debit debt is rather a forced state in which the enterprise is, only because it exists in specific conditions of the market.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
It cannot but have a debit debt.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But it is not interested in it in excessive magnitude.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
It is not interested in it at all.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000
But it cannot have it below the required magnitude for business to exist.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
That is why it is interested in a decrease, but not below the minimum required magnitude.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
But on the other hand, as we can see from this formula, the enterprise is extremely interested in increasing the creditors' interest.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Of course, living in business at someone else's expense is simply amazing.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Everyone is lending you money, and you are developing without even using your own money.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
It would seem that this is an ideal dream.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But in fact, the use of creditors' interest again has its limits.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Firstly, you are being credited only because you are in the market conditions.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
You are not being credited for charity.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000
You are being credited because if you are not given a credit, you will take it from another enterprise.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
It is a competition.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
That is why you are being credited.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
But on the other hand, you are not being credited for charity.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
That is why creditors' interest always exists in some limits.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
On the other hand, creditors' interest is a debt that you have to pay back anyway.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
That is why it is impossible to increase creditors' interest infinitely.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You have to pay it back.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Moreover, creditors' interest, as we know, has a hidden payment for these money.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
You still get it for free.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
It is just hidden in the price, but there is a payment for it.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
On the other hand, creditors' interest has to be paid back.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
It is determined by business ethics.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You are given it until you pay it back.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
As soon as you refuse to pay it back, no one will give it to you.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Moreover, you will be demanded to pay it back.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
By all the truths and untruths.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
That is why creditors' interest is such a value that is within the business ethics.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You are given it, you pay it back, and all parties are satisfied with the normal business process.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000
The main thing is not to get lost in this optimal process and to be within it.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
During the production itself, a number of factors influence the current financial needs.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
First of all, it is the duration of the production and export cycle.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Imagine that the longer the production process, the more money is in the form of assets.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
The longer the cycle, the more money.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And the longer the export cycle, the longer the company can't sell its products,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
the more the products are kept in the warehouse.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
All this requires additional financial resources, which are concentrated in this form.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:01.000
That is why the duration of the production cycle and the duration of the household cycle are not indifferent to the businessman.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
But if the duration of the export cycle depends on the production process itself,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
and if you can't do it faster than the production process,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
then the businessman can influence the rhythmicality of the production.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
He shouldn't allow these failures.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
The production process should be minimized in time.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Then the funds that will be frozen in the production process will be minimal.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
The household cycle is also very important for the businessman.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
On the one hand, the businessman is interested in selling the product as soon as possible.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Of course, why keep the product frozen if the market is ready to take it?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:59.000
But the household cycle is also a very important part of the business.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
If you don't have any ready-made products in the warehouse,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
you have an opportunity to refuse a partner who would like to purchase the product.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
He comes and says, I want to buy from you.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
You say, no, we've sold everything, there's nothing.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
He turns around and leaves to your competitor.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
And you lose a partner who you could have used to produce a lot of your products.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And the next time you have a product, but there's no one to sell it to.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
That's why you should have as many ready-made products in the warehouse

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
so that you don't have to say no to anyone.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And so that everyone who approached you for ready-made products,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000
would say with a smile, yes, we're happy to see you, we're ready to offer you our products.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Then the number of business partners who will purchase it from you will increase,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
or at least not decrease, which is very important for the business.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
That's why in the household cycle, a certain part of the goods,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
a certain part of the finances are concentrated there,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
and you can't get anywhere without it.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
This is the market, this is the life of the business.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
But the current financial needs are also influenced by the pace of production growth.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It has a very specific effect.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
The higher the pace of production growth, the more you produce products,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
the more you need to invest in the production of the household cycle,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
providing these growth rates.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Moreover, you will also need the means,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
but they are not reversible,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
they are the main means that are aimed at the technical rearmament of your production.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
In order to ensure faster growth of production,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
you need to use more and more modern means of production.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Thus, if you want to have higher pace of growth,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
if your business is expanding,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
you need to invest more and more money in the production process,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
in the household cycle,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
which requires additional finances.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
The seasonality of production is also influenced.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
The thing is that modern business is in many ways seasonal.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
The easiest example is agriculture.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
The harvest is a seasonal factor.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
The harvest is not planted and harvested every year.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
The season is a year,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
and during this year the harvest is planted,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
the harvest is harvested,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
it is stored, processed, and so on.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
But not only agriculture.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
There is also seasonality, which is related to the seasons.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
The seasons are very dependent on the season.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
In winter, construction work is much more difficult than in summer.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
That's why builders always want to do construction work in summer.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Another thing is that it is not always possible.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
As soon as spring and summer come,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
the money ends.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Unfortunately, this is the practice.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
When builders want to build, they have nothing to build.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
And in winter, when everything is over,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
money appears.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
To avoid this, it is necessary to plan correctly.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
In summer and spring, in autumn,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the largest amount of money is left,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
and this is a seasonal factor to use in construction.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Probably, in other industries,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
you can say the same,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
but in construction,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
the whole clothing is seasonal.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Seasonality also includes the production of clothing.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
All clothing is seasonal.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
There is clothing for summer, for winter.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Any company that produces clothing

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
is adjusted in such a way

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
to produce it for that season,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
when it will be used as needed.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Seasonality leads to the fact

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
that the enterprise works unevenly for a year.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Not because it works badly,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
but because of the production cycle.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Accordingly, with uneven work,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
in different periods of the year,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
the enterprise needs more or less

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
turnover for work.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
The enterprise must adjust its turnover

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
to have enough turnover for the season.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Moreover, seasonality is not only in production,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
but also in implementation.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
For example, builders,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
and those who buy apartments,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
know that there is a season of buying apartments.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
There is a period of vacations,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
when the sale of a new apartment is frozen.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And after leaving the vacation,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
the sale of a new apartment is activated.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And a significant number of apartments

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
are purchased.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Thus, the implementation of the enterprise

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
is not only in production,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
but also in implementation.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
In addition to the production of the enterprise,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
there is also a supply.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
The supply itself can have a production character,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
but it is not a product.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And when the raw material is produced unevenly

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
all year round,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
but only in certain periods,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
it is necessary to buy it

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
and store it.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
The enterprise is forced to buy

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
the raw material in season,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
to have special capacity for storing it,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
and to use it normally in the production process.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Thus, the enterprise has a break-through

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
of liquidity of financial resources.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And the enterprise must,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
in advance,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
foresee the break-through of liquidity,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
and foresee the sources

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
through which

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
these break-throughs of liquidity will be covered.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
The state of the industry

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
also affects the current financial needs.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Our enterprise, which we are considering,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
is not located on a residential island.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
It is surrounded by the same enterprises

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
as the industry,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
its competitors,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
which, in turn,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
try to seize the market share

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
and track the competitors.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And not to lose to them in the competition.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Lack of turnover

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
leads to the fact that the enterprise

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
is out of competition.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
The competitors have turnover

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
and can offer the product to the consumer.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And if we do not have this money

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
and we will not be able to normalize the product

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the state of the competitive environment

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
and the state of the industry

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
plays a very important role.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
The industry is not only a competitive environment.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
It is also what we produce,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
what is popular as a commodity.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
There are fashionable goods.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
If we do not monitor the state of the market,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
the state of fashion,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
the state of the production,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
it may turn out that soon

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
this product will not be needed.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
It will simply cease to be in demand.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
The enterprise must monitor the state of the market,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the needs of the market

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
and adjust in time to produce only the product

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
that the market needs.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
In addition to the above factors,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
the enterprise must also

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
meet the requirements of the added value standard.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
The enterprise must meet the requirements

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
of the added value standard.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
It is clear that each enterprise

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
would like to earn as much as possible

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
and have as much as possible

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
of the added value standard.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
But there are two ends of the stick.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
The enterprise should try to sell the goods

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
at the highest price possible.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
At the same cost,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
this, of course, provides a high standard

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
of the added value.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
But a higher price for the goods

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
that the enterprise produces

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
requires additional actions from the enterprise.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
First, it is not enough to increase the price

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
of the goods.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
One of the options is to move to a state of monopoly.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
If you are a monopolist,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
then you increase the price

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
and it is easier to implement it.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
If you are a monopolist

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
and you have three to five main competitors,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
you have to enter into a conspiracy

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
to become a monopolist through a conspiracy

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
and to achieve a higher standard of the added value.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
But the elasticity of the goods

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
also plays a role here.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Remember our first lecture

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
where we talked about the elasticity of the goods?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
If the goods are not elastic,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
for example, salt,

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
then the price increase

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
does not affect the ability to implement the goods.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You sell the same amount of goods as before,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
but at a higher price.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And the standard of the added value increases

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
and the enterprise feels euphoria

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
from getting additional profit.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
But if your goods are elastic

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
and more and more high-elastic,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
then the price increase is not a good condition.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
The thing is that if you are not a monopolist

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
and you are in a state of conspiracy,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
then the price increase leads to the fact

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
that the consumers stop buying the goods

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
and start buying the goods from your competitors

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
who did not raise the price.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
The sale of elastic goods

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
in order to get more profit,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
as you remember,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
should not increase the price,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
but should decrease the price.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
When we talk about the standard of the added value,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
we are talking about the price increase.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
The price increase is good for non-elastic goods

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
or for elastic goods

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
that are still produced by monopolists

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
or monopolists.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Then, due to these economic forms,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
the goods become non-elastic

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
and the price increases.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And if you are not a very large enterprise

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
and you cannot be a monopolist or a monopolist,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
but you are in a competitive environment,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
you need to remember

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
that the price increase

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
is not the only way

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
to get profit from the business.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
You can get profit from the business

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
by reducing the price,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
reducing the standard of the added value,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
but increasing the volume of the produced goods.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And the total profit you get

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
from the production of the standard of the added value

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
for the number of produced goods will increase.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So, if you are not an oligopolist

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
and not a monopolist,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
do not despair.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
You can reduce the price

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
and then you will live perfectly

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
without increasing the price.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
For the coverage of the current financial needs

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
that we have just talked about,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
enterprises need financial resources.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Where do enterprises get the financial resources

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
to realize their needs?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
We have already said that the best is their own financial resources.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
But if they are not enough,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
and if they do not have enough credit

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
that is generated by the business partners

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
to provide them with the goods,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
then the enterprise, as we remember,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
turns to the financial market

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
and gets the financial resources

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
from the market

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
in the form of a loan or a bank loan.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
I repeat,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
a loan is the obtaining of financial resources

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
from the same business partners as you,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
and a loan is the obtaining of financial resources

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
from the banks.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
We have already talked about this,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
but we have repeated it again.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So, a loan or a bank loan

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
is a way to cover the current financial needs.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
We are talking about short-term financial needs,

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
so we are talking about short-term loans

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
or short-term bank loans.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
In addition to these,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
there is an opportunity to issue a VEXEL.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
And these enterprises often use it.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
VEXEL is a very convenient form of short-term financing.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
The thing is that you issue VEXEL yourself.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
You do not have to go to any financial institution

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
to issue a VEXEL.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
There is a law that regulates the content of VEXEL,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
which should be indicated in VEXEL.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
The form of VEXEL is determined by you,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
so that you can write VEXEL

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
on a clean piece of paper.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Only if everything that is written in VEXEL

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
meets the requirements of the law.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
It is easy to issue a VEXEL,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
but the most important thing in VEXEL is that it is accepted.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
When instead of money you are allowed to take VEXEL,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
you are using the reputation of a reliable business partner.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
You are trusted and instead of money you are allowed to take VEXEL.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
VEXEL is an urgent payment

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
that you promise to return

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
after some time,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
which is described in VEXEL.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
You will be returned VEXEL,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
and you will be returned money

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
with the interest rate that is described in VEXEL.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
If you are a reliable business partner,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
if you are trusted,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
then they will agree to take your VEXEL.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
If you are not reliable in business,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
then you will not be able to use

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
such a form of attracting financial funds

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
as issuing VEXELs.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
In addition to VEXELs,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
you can use factoring.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
This is a new form of financing,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
a new one in the Russian market.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
It does not mean that it is never used in the world.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Factoring has been known for a long time in the world,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
and it is used in all countries,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
but in the Russian market it is a young form.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And in terms of time,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
not all enterprises that are even

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
worthy of using factoring, use it.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Moreover, not everyone knows about factoring,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
so when we talk about it now,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
it is very important,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
because factoring has a serious future.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
What is factoring?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
I must say, so that you can clearly imagine

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
when to turn to it.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Factoring is used by production enterprises,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
which produce the product

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
and then transfer it to the consumer

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
in the form of a commodity loan.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000
But the enterprise cannot expand the commodity loan

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
to infinity,

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
because it has a fixed limited amount of money.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
It can give a commodity loan

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
no more than it can give,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
and then it will stop.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
And if it wants to expand its production,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
it needs to increase the quantity of the commodity

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
that is provided in the form of a commodity loan.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
It needs money for that.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
And if all the lighter forms

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
that we have been talking about today are already used,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
and they cannot be used anymore,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
then we should remember about factoring.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Factoring is not a loan.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
It is not provided by banks,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
although banks sometimes participate in it,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
but by special factoring companies

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
that are created with banks

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
and provide factoring services.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
The essence of factoring services is that

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
the production enterprise unloads the commodity,

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
provides a commodity loan,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
and the factory company

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
transfers the documents of the commodity unloading.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
And the factory company exchanges

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
the debt that the enterprise has

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
for the money

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
that is needed to cover the debt.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Thus, the enterprise,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
in fact,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
gets the money

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
that it can use for further production.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
And it does not need to wait

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
for the return of the money from the trading partners.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
The trading partners can get a very long term loan,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
and the enterprise gets the money right away

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
on the fact of the realization of the commodity.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
It is very convenient.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
But all the convenience

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
should be assumed,

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
that the enterprise gets the money

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
from the factoring company,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
and it should pay the factoring company

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
the same way as you pay the bank

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
a percentage of its use of credit funds.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
And the factoring company

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
should pay a certain fee for the services it provides.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
So, if you get financial funds

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
either from the bank

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
or from the factoring company,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
all these funds are not free.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
There is a certain fee for them.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
And the bank percentage is even less than the factoring one.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Therefore, the enterprise always takes the bank loan

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
earlier than the factoring one.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
The factoring is the use of money.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
The bank provides the factoring company

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
with money,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
and the factoring company provides it to you.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Thus, you pay the bank a percentage

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
and the factoring company a percentage

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
for the factoring company's participation in the operation.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Therefore, the factoring funds are more expensive

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
than the bank funds.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
But we have already said that we have taken all the bank funds

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
that we could get.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
The banks don't give us any more.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
We take the factoring company.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
We take the more expensive funds

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
for not having the cheaper ones.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
But we have to pay for these funds anyway.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
The question arises,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
is any enterprise profitable

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
with the credit funds or the factoring funds?

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
The answer is simple, but we have to fixate it.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
The fact is that there is a profitability of the business.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Any businessman gets a profit.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
There is a norm of the profit he gets.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And the profitability of the business

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
should be higher than the percentage

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
that you pay for the factoring funds.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
In this case, if this condition is fulfilled,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
it is profitable for you to use the factoring funds.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Therefore, no matter how much you take the factoring funds,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
the result will be profitable for you.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
This delta that arises between the profitability of your business

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
and the percentage that you have to pay for the factoring funds

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
is the result of your financial operations.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
And it brings additional income to the company.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
But if a businessman has a business

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
that is less profitable than the percentage

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
that you have to pay to the bank

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
and the percentage that you have to pay to the bank

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
and the percentage that you have to pay to the bank

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
or the factoring company,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
it is not profitable to use these funds.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Because you will pay more money for these funds

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
than you will get from using them in the business.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Therefore, before you go to the bank

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
or the factoring company,

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000
you should look at the profitability of your business

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
and compare it with the percentage that you have to pay

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
for using the factoring funds.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And, accordingly, make the appropriate decision.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And at the end of our first question,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
I would like to make one small but very interesting remark.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
For small and medium-sized enterprises,

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
there is a unique feature.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
It is so unique that it is a sin not to know about it.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
The fact is that these enterprises can build

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
the system of current financial needs

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
in such a way that it has a negative meaning.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
That is, to have more money flows

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
than the need in these financial funds.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Do you remember in our formula we said

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
that the current need is determined

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
by the need for reserves and debt.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000
And the minus of the reserve and credit debt.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Thus, if the credit debt exceeds the debt and reserves,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000
you get into a unique situation

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
when you, due to the business,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
due to the situation in the market,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
have borrowed more money

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
than you need to borrow from others.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Can you imagine?

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
You are in a situation when you work

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
exclusively with borrowed funds.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And you did not specially borrow them.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
This is the situation in the market.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
You work in a situation when you are credited.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And you are credited constantly.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
For an indefinite period.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And in this situation you can be in for a very long time.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
And the middle enterprises should strive to get into it.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
When you are given more money with reserves,

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
than you need to make the production process.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
And to give as a commodity credit to your customers.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
An amazing situation.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
And I am glad that the audience of this lecture is in such a state.
