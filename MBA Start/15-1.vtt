00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.840
Hi to.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.860
My name is Sergei Unknown.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.560
Our video course is devoted to the basics

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.960
of project management.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.320
During this course, we will

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.620
consider Russian project management

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.380
experience as well as overseas

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.500
project management experience.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900
We will look at it from

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.540
both the negative and the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.560
positive side.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.880
The aim of this course is to familiarize

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.800
with the generally accepted vocabulary

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.220
in project management, with the standard

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.920
terminology, which is used not

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.680
only in Russia, but also in communication

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.600
between different managers,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
projects of different countries.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.260


00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.200
We will briefly examine the main methods

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.740
and technologies of project management.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.900
We will briefly examine the most

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420
acceptable approaches in project

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.740
management in real conditions

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.240
of modern business in Russia.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.580
And I hope this course will help you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.580
in project management in your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.000
enterprise and significantly improve

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.380
the quality of project management,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480
increase the productivity of this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.000
project management process and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.500
somehow systematize the general

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.400
material that is considered in

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.240
the discipline called project

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.480
management.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.860
If we talk about the structure of this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.460
project, then, of course, we will first

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.540
touch the history of this area.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.340
Next, the short content, i.e. individual

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.840
disciplines of project management.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.640
We will also look at examples, we will

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.380
look at better samples of technology

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.820
and project management techniques.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.160
Well, it is clear that here we

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.180
will also use data from literature,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.620
references, monographs

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.300
and textbooks.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.260
So, again briefly about the content of the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.320
sections that we will go through in

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.360
this course.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.280
So, the first section is a general

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.080
definition, axiomics of project

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.020
management, a brief historical

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.200
overview of project management

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.740
disciplines.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.800
Furthermore, the main structure

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.600
or block scheme, which consists

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.540
of the discipline of project management,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.000
is primarily three such significant

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.740
blocks as control objects,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.960
control subjects, and project

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.440
management process.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480
Further, within the project management

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.000
process, we will look more

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.920
in detail at the functional areas

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.740
of project management,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.880
information systems and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.360
tools that are applied in project

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.940
management.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.700
Next, we will consider, in fact,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.660
the organizational structure that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.340
implements the methods, technologies,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.360
use these tools.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.900
This structure is usually called

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.280
the project management office or the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.900
project management center of the enterprise.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.100
Now let’s look at the characteristics

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.700
of portfolio management.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.620
In addition, we will briefly review

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.880
the adopted training systems,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.100
the most effective and certification

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.620
systems of project managers.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.100
Finally, let us summarize the results briefly.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.120
Let us go directly to

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.980
the material.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.400
If we talk about project management,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.820
it is understandable that the project

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.600
activity of a person is as old as

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.620
the world, as the person himself.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.360
From the moment of realizing man himself

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.100
as a reasonable being, we

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.980
understand that at this moment

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.280
the project activity begins.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.580
Thus we see that during the entire time

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.600
of human existence, a huge amount of experience

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.220
has been accumulated in the field

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.540
of design activities.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.960
And here to create something

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.740
fundamentally new, euristically new

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.040
knowledge to give in this field

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.460
is very difficult.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.860
During the last 20th century in

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.120
the field of project management, there

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.100
were fundamentally new knowledge, well,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.640
they can be read on the fingers of

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.620
one hand.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820
But in this area of project

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.020
management, many professionals

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.260
are trying to orient themselves

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.140
in such a way as to take and systematize

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.140
the accumulated expertise in

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.960
both the field of overall management

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.540
and in the field of project

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.320
management.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.220
During the 20th century, many experts

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.200
and professionals from leading industrialized

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.740
countries have systematized the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.280
knowledge acquired by mankind in the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.960
field of project management and are

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.180
engaged in the essentially out-of-

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.660
the-scenes classification of these materials.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.920
A terminological package is created,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.260
for example, such a package that

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.620
is used more or less effectively

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.640
in the US, in Western Europe,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.400
in Russia, its own terminological

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.100
package is created, which describes

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.260
the area of project management.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.240
Naturally, these packages differ, and here

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.080
we often get confused when we talk

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.320
about a new terminology that describes

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.700
the already accumulated experience in

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.560
a particular project management section,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.980
or we talk about fundamentally

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.440
new knowledge.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.600
In general, we understand that

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.820
project management is not

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.880
only a complex of scientific

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.540
approach, but above all,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.320
this art.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.060
In project management we often

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.900
use the same methods that

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.080
are applied in art, in this

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.220
area of human activity.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.880
And we understand that speaking about

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.520
the same essence, about the same

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.760
content of project management,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.460
we can use different terms.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.120
Thus, when we begin to analyze

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.440
the content of project

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.120
management, we may use the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.320
approach of the Project Management

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.420
Institute of the United States,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.120
the project management institute,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.540
or we use the terminology

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.120
block that is fixed in the international

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.740
ISO standards, or in the approach

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.780
of the International Project

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.700
Management Association,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.460
or in our Russian norms,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.340
which are set out

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.800
in such a document called

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.040
the National Requirement

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.380
for Competence in Project

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.560
Management of the Russian

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.940
Federation.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.480
This document was developed

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.800
by the Russian Project Management Association,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.400
and it is called, in short, the NTC

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.380
of Russia in the field of

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.880
project management.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.400
In general, it is clear that the area

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.380
of project management has been formed for a long

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.500
time, and there is a lot of experience.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.540
If we look at different approaches,

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.360
we will see that in these approaches,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.460
there is a very, very

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.640
much in common.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.420
The only thing that can

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.980
differ, I will repeat, is terms.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.740
So let’s look at a general

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.660
definition of project management.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.840
What is Project?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.840
In Russian, the word project

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.280
means several such entities,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.740
which in English literature

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.960
are designated, for example,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.580
by two terms.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.220
The first term

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.360
used in English literature

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.700
is design.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.920
And it is understandable that we are talking

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.060
about the subject essence of the project,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.940
for example, a project of a building,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.740
or a project of an information system,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.100
or a project documentation.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.240
This can be summarized with the term design.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.280
The second term used

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.040
in the international community

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.880
to describe project activities

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.360
is the term project.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.240
And this is just the part of the content

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.100
that will be the main part of our video course.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.560
A project is an event

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.180
that aims to create a new unique

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.500
product or service, performed

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.760
within the framework of

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.840
limited resources.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.620
There are many different

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.320
definitions of projects, precisely as events.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.260
And here we must still choose

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.360
the most optimal or the most concise.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.520
I repeat this definition.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.360
Of all definitions, it

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.760
is indeed the most meaningful,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.620
on the one hand, and the most

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.500
concise, on the other.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.480
A project is an event aimed

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.740
at creating a new product or service,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.320
performed within the framework

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.340
of limited resources.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.480
With limited resources, we

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.880
understand a broad

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880
semantic field.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.260
In particular, time, budget,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.340
financial and economic resources,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.900
material and technical base,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.480
human resources, or sometimes

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.400
called labor or human resources,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.080
intellectual resources, technological

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.060
resources, and so on.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.640
Already in the definition itself,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.840
if we approach this definition

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.080
with a very careful analysis,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.980
we see two keywords.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.440
The first keyword is a new, unique

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.320
product or service.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.100
This word is new.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.460
The second key word is limited

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.000
resources.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.580
That is, at the first half of

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:57.180
the analysis of this term, we

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.360
see that this event is limited in time.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.880
There is a beginning, there is a completion

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.720
of the project.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.160
We have a limited budget, so the

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.980
budget is clearly fixed.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.560
We are limited in labor resources.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.780
And this limitation, as a rule, we

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.640
express it in the term project team.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.440
That is, the group of people,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.300
specialists who are directly or indirectly

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.740
involved in the project, in

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.720
the implementation of the project.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.900
So, we must initially feel

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.700
and understand that we are

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.260
dealing with any project with

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.380
limited resources.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.560
During this course I will position

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.960
myself as a project manager

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.240
or, in other words, in Russian,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.920
a manager, a project

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.160
manager.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.320
And I will treat you, the listeners,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.840
exactly as the project

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.920
managers, as the listeners.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.300
Therefore, we, understanding the

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.260
main term in the field of project

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.520
management, the project itself, this

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.140
fundamental term, we must understand

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.080
that the manager, the project manager

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.840
should never deal with the problems of

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.840
the project, starting with the

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.660
seizure of the fact that he did not have

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.380
enough time, he did not have enough

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.420
budget, he did not have enough labor

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.400
human resources and so on.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.860
If we start working in management

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.120
with this approach, then, of

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.280
course, no specialist, no

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.600
professional, no director,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.800
CEO, manager will take

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.500
us seriously, as people

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.660
who know the basics of project

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.900
management.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.300
Why is?

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.180
Because it is immediately apparent that

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.600
if we start to throw these limitations

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.500
into mind, it is immediately apparent

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.980
that we do not quite understand

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.560
what we are fundamentally dealing

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.080
with, namely with project activities

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.800
that are based on limited

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.780
resources.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.700
If we do the next halfway on the

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.280
path of analyzing another keyword,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.080
new, then we will see that in any

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.320
project there is an element of novelty

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.620
and uniqueness.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.740
This means that if we take any

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.900
project, we can find 90% of

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.260
novelty and uniqueness in some

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.020
projects, half a percent

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.060
or a little in some projects,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.320
but in any case this uniqueness,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.660
this novelty is

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.600
present.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.840
And this means that we, entering this

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.340
sphere of activity, must understand

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.420
that the project manager, the

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.300
project manager must test the creative

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.240
beginnings that will be needed

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.960
in the process of implementing

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.800
the project sooner or later.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.180
Why is?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.300
Because sooner or later we will

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.120
get stuck in this element of novelty,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.720
uniqueness, and we will face problems

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.500
that have not been solved so far.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.800
And these problems were not solved not

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.740
only by us, not only by our group, our

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.600
project team, but also by the

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.100
environment, but if we speak in

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.720
general, we did not solve this

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.840
problem, nobody solved it in our

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.840
community, and on a larger scale.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.400
Therefore, we must develop

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.660
the ability to solve

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.020
problems independently, and

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.080
this is often called a creative

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.700
approach.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.200
In general, if we take and

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.780
compare project activities with other

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.020
types of human activities, for

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.560
example, with production,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.900
then we will see a fundamental

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.020
difference.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.520
In the design activity, everything

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.360
is aimed at creating a

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.560
new, unique product, in the

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.280
production activity, everything

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.960
is aimed at creating a

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.180
standard product.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.920
In the project activities, not all

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.080
approaches, methods are systematized,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.600
described clearly and fully 100% regulated.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.720
In the production activity, the entire

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.940
process is regulated, described

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.600
very clearly.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.760
These are two main differences

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.460
between design and production.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.200
If we consider this keyword "new"

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.240
in more detail, we can make such

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.960
an analogy in distinguishing

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.280
between design and

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.200
production activities.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.260
For example, the artist writes a painting.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.640
This phenomenon is unique in itself.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.100
At the output, there is a

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.840
unique unique result

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.140
- a picture.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.120
But if we begin to reproduce

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.860
this picture, copy it, then

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.240
production begins.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.860
The sculptor makes a bust of a

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.600
significant figure or a state figure.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.220
This event is unique.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.900
At the output has a unique

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.600
product result - unique one.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.600
If we start making copies of this

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.280
bust to be delivered throughout the

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.020
Soviet Union, and the sizes can be

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.440
different, for example, 200

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.760
thousand pieces, then it is already

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.880
production.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.120
Another example.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.620
We need to build new cars

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.200
with a capacity of thousands

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.980
of cars per day in

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.480
24 hours.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.460
We begin this event with the fact

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.260
that we explore how to

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.940
optimally, methodically,

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.100
technologically implement it.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.080
We plan, organize and execute.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.540
We start with the fact that

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.900
we determine where it is – land

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.320
removal, territory, then we determine

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.360
what we are building, maybe

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.720
part of the premises we will rent,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.420
maybe part we will build, then

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.580
we must solve the issues of communications,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.180
power supply, heat, water,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.740
then the problems of supply of

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.200
materials, equipment, then the

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.180
problems related to the technological

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.800
lines, assembly lines, organizational

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.760
problems that affect the creation,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.500
formation of brigades,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.040
installers, assemblers,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.580
up to the point that we must

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.740
solve the problems of sales

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.120
of the resulting product,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.840
the result of the project,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.700
these new cars.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.100
We start this event, get to

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.520
the test operation, release

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.840
the test samples and finally

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.680
start our production at the

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.300
planned 100% capacity.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.380
At the time when we launched 100%

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.380
of the capacity, when the acts of delivery

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.700
of the relevant bodies,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.220
commissions, we have the

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.340
whole process is already going

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.140
into the production phase.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.920
Next we start stamping

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.940
a typical product, these new cars.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.760
Everything that was before this point

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.040
can be clearly attributed to

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.560
the project activity, and then all

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.520
our actions can be attributed to the production.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.660
It is also interesting to consider the evolution

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.340
of the team that was engaged in this project.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.780
Experience shows that the project

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.580
team can stay and move to the production

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.040
sphere, let’s say the project

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.780
manager can stay at the

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.640
facility, lead it and

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.720
become the general manager

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.420
of the plant.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.640
There are such options when a part

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.720
of the team stays in production, a

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.260
part goes to a new project, and

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.440
then, let’s say, a part of the team

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.300
or the whole team or the same

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.920
project manager goes to a new

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.340
project, for example, to

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.440
build a new factory somewhere in

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.600
Siberia, on Angara.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.780
Thus we understand that, in principle,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.440
the project activity is different

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.160
from the production activity, but,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.400
nevertheless, it is interrelated.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.040
This division of design and production

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.000
activities, it is clear that it is

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.280
introduced by man, it is somewhat

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.360
artificial, but, nevertheless, the

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.140
main differences in this division

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.820
are present.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.020
If we take, consider in general,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.880
what is project management methods,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.620
we see that we can say that in

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.620
the activity, in any area

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.380
of activity we can apply project

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.960
approaches in such a way, considering

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.740
activities as a separate project

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.320
or group of projects and

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.260
applying to these activities,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.760
to these actions the approaches

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.500
and technologies that

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.580
we apply when considering

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.620
the project, when

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.260
managing the project.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.120
This is what is called a project

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.200
approach, that is, the application

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.680
of a full set of techniques

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.640
and technologies used

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.700
in project management.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.660
If we look more carefully

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.820
at what are limited resources, we

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.720
will see that we really have

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.000
in any project, first of

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.860
all, limited time, budget, material

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.500
and technical

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.720
base, labor resources, and

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.960
these limitations impose

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.220
specific, and sometimes

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.140
very strict requirements

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.040
for project management,

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.560
for project activities.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.240
We will consider this more in detail.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.240
In fact, the entire process

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.120
of planning, organizing and executing

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.280
a project is often called the business

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.580
process of project management.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.020
The business process of project management

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.740
cannot dominate the processes

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.960
that directly affect the

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.300
subject, the subject essence

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.100
of the project.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.240
For example, if we are talking

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.360
about the creation of an information system,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.480
it is clear that at the head of the

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.900
corner of the project of this should be

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.740
the information system itself, and

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.240
the methodological, methodological

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.960
part - is the service part, which

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.020
contributes to the effective implementation

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.100
of the project in the subject area.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.380
Thus, we conclude that the

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.740
business process of project

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.540
management in the enterprise

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.820
is a service business process

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.160
that ensures increased

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.760
productivity, increased

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.620
profitability, profitability

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.300
or, as we generally

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.280
say, the efficiency of

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.620
the enterprise’s project

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.540
activities.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.690
If we consider the project

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.790
activity of man, as I have

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.030
said, it really begins at

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.970
the moment when man becomes

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.050
aware of himself as a

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.030
reasonable being.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.750
Many experts consider human

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.930
activity from this point

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.550
of view that a person differs from

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.490
other animals primarily by

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.470
the fact that he consciously

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.570
plans, organizes and executes

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.330
projects, that is, engages

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.370
in project activities.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.110
Indeed, the project activity

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.670
is very old and we can judge

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.150
its results by the records that

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.550
remain there, or the remaining

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.530
structure, that is,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.830
the results of the project

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.590
activity.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:25.830
And here we see that we are

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.950
dealing really with a phenomenon

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.350
that has developed over

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.630
a large time scale.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.750
It is very interesting to consider

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.010
the outstanding projects that have been

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.550
implemented in the history of humanity.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:52.030
Of course, we had different projects

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.750
on the time scale of humanity, but

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.430
I would like to briefly stop on

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.330
2-3 projects.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.510
The most ancient projects

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.150
we can somehow judge from historical

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.930
evidence are projects related

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.230
to stopping civilization in

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.030
both Africa, Central

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.170
and North Africa, and activities

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.750
that affect human

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.890
activity in America.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.170


00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.710
From the moment of the transition

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.770
of the Mongoloid races to North

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.290
America, then Central and South,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.970
we can observe the remains and

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.850
evidence of the project activity.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.490
And this, according to experts, was

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:52.230
about 15-18 thousand years ago.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.410
There is evidence of design

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.250
activity in Africa, which relates

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.690
us 12 thousand years ago.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.250
Well, more fresh, relatively

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.190
fresh evidence, which we can unambiguously

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.150
characterize as the results

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.190
of project activities.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.070
These are the same Egyptian pyramids,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.790
the pyramid of Cheops.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.050
Well, such projects, for example,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.890
in the UK, the Stonehenge project.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.810
This project, the town of Stonehenge,

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.950
was implemented about 4 thousand

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.810
years ago.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.050
Many experts in design activities,

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.730
in particular, say that

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:46.090
the aim of this project was to

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.130
demonstrate the capacities

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.270
of man, first of all such

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.890
capabilities as that he can build

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.150
such unique structures from

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.910
giant monolithic stone pebbles.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.850
Well, if you don’t know, in short,

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.550
this is a structure that

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:11.130
now looks like P-shaped such structures.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.790
Two monolithic stones stand

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.330
vertically, and are turned up.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.050
There are several such structures in

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.230
the town of Stonehenge.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.650
But if we carefully and

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.290
professionally approach the

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.850
study of this project, namely the definition

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.650
of the purpose of the project, then

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.570
we can see that the purpose of this

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.770
project was not to demonstrate

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.330
construction capabilities,

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.210
but to demonstrate deeper, more

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.730
meaningful, more extensive

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.570
provisions.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.810
If we look at one of the

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.690
central P-shaped arch more carefully,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.090
we will see a small cross-line

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:06.090
in the upper fence, more precisely

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.810
the pawn that crosses

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.770
this stone.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:15.170
On June 22, on the day of the

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.830
summer solstice at sunrise, the rays of

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.270
the sun pass exactly through the

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.470
center of this day.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:28.270
And this is not simple, it

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.570
is a clear pattern, and we understand

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.930
that the person who created this

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.790
in our terminology, the project

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.790
manager or project manager,

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.110
he consistently created this

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.630
layout, this phenomenon.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.210
That is, the project manager,

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.910
the project manager in those distant

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.830
times shows us that despite its insignificance

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.830
or small scale, the human being

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.350
in the universe is able to realize

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.710
the phenomena of nature of large

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.130
scale, significant scale, phenomena

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.670
that describe the movement

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.650
of bodies of the solar system,

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.430
the sun and the earth.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.430
And these are the points that

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.750
seem to have been crucial in the course

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.790
of this project.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.710
That is, the project manager,

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.170
the project manager in our terms, he

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.590
set the following goal, to show,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.030
despite the fact that a man is a

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.570
sandstone in the universe,

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.870
he is able to consciously understand,

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.950
study, analyze the phenomena

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.550
surrounding.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.790
And the manager, the manager of this

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:05.210
project, leads the viewer,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.370
the consumer, the results of this

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.090
project to the point where

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.210
this consumer thinks that he

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.030
is really such a being, a creation,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.770
but what is his place in this

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.190
world, in this life, his purpose,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.810
what he is capable of, and

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.610
so on.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.330
And now, after more than 4000 years,

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.270
we see that the result of

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.950
this project is still in demand.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.870
People come to this place

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.350
of Stonehenge and start

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.090
to think, really, who they are,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.890
why they are here, what they

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.950
can leave behind in the big

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.730
sense, after themselves for humanity.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.240


00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.500
But the task with which

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.020
this goal is achieved is

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.440
exactly the same as the

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.820
project manager took and built

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.840
this structure.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.580
That is, we thus clearly see that the

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.360
goal of the project is one, the task of

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.760
the project or the task of the project

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.660
is another.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.300
Through the solution of the project

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.820
objectives we the project objectives.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.100
There are many different examples in the

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.360
field of project management, project activities.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.120
I would like to briefly stop on

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.840
the current section of project activity.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:54.080
First of all, the analysis of accumulation

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.380
and formation of the

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.560
terminological body in the

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.740
field of project management.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.800
The current situation in the

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.160
methodical part here is that we see

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.040
that the leading position here is

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.400
occupied by Western Europe and the

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.480
United States.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.040
We see that here really very structurally

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.420
and systematically everything is considered.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.520
New terms were created, a new

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.500
base was created, and this is a

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.300
zoological classification.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.080
And the founder of all this was at the

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.080
beginning of the 20th century Frederick

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.880
Taylor.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.520
Frederick Taylor was primarily

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.060
engaged in linear processes, analysis

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.600
of production activities,

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.720
but these results of his

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.420
analysis already went to the analysis

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.300
of project activities.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.380
His continuator, associate at

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.720
one time was Henry Gunt, the

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.440
same Gunt who invented the

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.800
diagram, it is so called, bears

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.500
his name.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.020
The Gantt Chart is

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.400
used in almost all modern

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.300
project management tools,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.300
such as, say, Microsoft

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.440
Project, Primovera,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.100
Spyder and many others.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.940
We see that very deep, serious classification

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.080
developments have gone on in this

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.860
field, and all this has led to

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.740
the fact that a new foundation

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.380
of classification character

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.460
has been laid in the field

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.200
of project management.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.620
This is a Western approach,

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.000
sometimes called the Taylor

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.940
approach, and it really

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.680
has a production base.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.060
It is often called mechanical

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.380
or conveyor approach.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.200
The essence of it is that if we consider

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.880
the project as a single whole,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.280
as a single process, then we can

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.360
an increase in the efficiency

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.120
of this activity, that is, the

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.140
efficiency of the project.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.770
We can increase this

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.470
efficiency by taking the whole

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.430
process, breaking it into component

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.730
units, while each link has

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.350
defining roles, and each

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.670
role has functions.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.550
In this situation, project management

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.330
will be reduced to monitoring

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.610
during the implementation

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.350
of the process, how responsible

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.070
executives and executives

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.090
ensure the execution

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.790
of planned defined functions.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.210
That is, the effectiveness of the

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.410
project can be maximum if at

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.670
each site, in each link of this

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.630
activity, this process we approach

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.390
as closely as possible

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.870
to those requirements that

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.390
we have recorded in

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.230
the instructions.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.050
And thus everything is reduced to the

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.410
fact that we essentially stamp these

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.410
functions in each link, that is,

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.770
the conversion method.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.740
If we take a little distraction

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.580
from the Western approach and look

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.520
wider, and what was done, let us admit

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.060
in Russia, whether we have

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.680
attempted some systemic, one

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.440
can say, scientific methodological

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.360
approach in the field of design

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.140
activities, then we will find

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.820
that there is really no white space

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.380
here, and here we have quite certain

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.460
developments in Russia, and these

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.620
developments are rooted not

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.480
in the early 20th century,

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.900
but in the early 19th century.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.200


00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.040
And these developments are related

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.680
to the name of the outstanding

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.720
Russian state figure Mikhail Mikhailovich

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.380
Spiransky.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.660
In 1825 he published several

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.060
of his papers, which he described

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.720
systematically, one can say on

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.660
a scientific basis, management

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.880
or in our terms management, including

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.520
the management of activity,

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.160
which we now call project

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.940
activity.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.660
Mikhail Mikhailovich Spiransky summarized

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.560
both Western European experience and

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.420
Russian experience, he explained

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.660
this in his works, then his initiatives

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.420
were picked up by many of our outstanding

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.500
figures, including Petro Arkadyevich

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.400
Stolypin, who worked at the turn

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.400
of the late 19th and early

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.080
20th century.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.340
Petro Arkadyevich Stolypin applied the

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.020
workings and experience

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.160
of his predecessors, first of all, in practice.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.000
His one of the main projects, the

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.780
agrarian reform project, unfortunately,

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.500
was only completed somewhere

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.540
in a third, different researchers

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.160
argue differently, but

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.060
it is clear that he did not complete

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.400
his project, he did not pass

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.600
even half due to the circumstances.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.300
You probably know that he was killed

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.280
in early last century in Kiev, and

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.960
he was unable to complete his main project,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.080
but even after going through part

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.940
of the road in this project, he

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.960
achieved significant results.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:44.420
In 1911, Russia, from a backward

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.040
agri-state in which there was

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.100
a phenomenon such as hunger,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.460
food shortage, agricultural

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.220
shortage, Petro Arkadyevich

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.400
Stolypin brought Russia

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.120
to one of the leading

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.620
places in the agri-

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.400
sphere in the world.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.580
As a result of this project,

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.780
he was able not only to feed

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.920
all Russia, but also to export

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.140
a significant part of

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.440
agricultural products

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.660
abroad.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.900
Another associate of Russian

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.000
methods of project management was

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.740
Alexey Kapitonovich Gastev.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.920
This is a wonderful man, a poet of

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.020
the Silver Age, one of the friends of

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.360
Velimir Khlebnikov.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.100
He was engaged in management in our

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.760
terminology, on a systemic approach.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.850
In the early century, during the so-

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.810
called Neap of new economic

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.650
policy, Aleksey Kapitonovich

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.890
Gastev organized the Central

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.790
Institute of Labor of the

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.650
Russian Federation.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:19.650
This is the 23rd, the beginning of the 24th

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.330
year of the last century.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:26.090
And here on a scientific basis, Alexey

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.470
Capitonovich and his employees develop

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.050
the so-called scientific organization

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.230
of labor approach or, in

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.190
short, note.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.330
The results of these developments

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.570
were used in the Soviet Union and

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.470
are now being used.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.530
In this approach, the employees

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.830
of the Central Institute of Labor

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.190
have systematized the methods,

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.550
technologies, not only

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.950
of production operational

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.530
activities, but also of activities

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.370
that we now call project

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.870
activities or Project

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.070
Management.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:13.630
At the same time, Alexey Capitonovich

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.750
explored our national Russian

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.510
features and mentality,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.050
and business, and business,

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.750
as we now say, well,

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.290
including project management.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.430
It is interesting to note that

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.630
Gastev worked at about the same

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:38.190
time as Taylor, but the approaches

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.810
in project management were significantly

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.730
different.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:48.830
Gastev understood that in the depths of

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.070
his soul, every Russian considers

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:56.090
himself a person, in the depths of his

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.150
soul, every participant in the project

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.030
activity, every member of the project

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.430
team, he considers himself a person

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:09.510
and therefore he treats himself as a

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.610
person and requires others to treat

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.230
him with respect, to treat him as

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.350
a person.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.530
Analyzing the entire complex

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.290
of national characteristics,

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.870
life values, traditions of people

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.370
who work, as we now say, in business

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.990
in Russia, Gastev comes

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.730
to the following conclusion,

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.670
which he places in methodological

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.290
approaches to the management

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.250
of the same project

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:43.450
activity.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:47.510
If we take, consider project

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.310
management as a single process, if

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:55.150
we take, divide this process into

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.070
separate units and if we take from

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.530
each unit, identify executives and

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.450
responsible executives, then when

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:09.610
considering the problems of increasing

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:11.910
the efficiency of the project

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.630
as a whole, we must take into account

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:20.250
suggestions and those thoughts,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.930
those ideas that executives

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.110
or responsible executives

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.610
give us on each link working

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:33.590
in the given process.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:36.570
For example, if we have a tokar in

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.270
the project and if we analyze

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.250
the problem of how to increase the efficiency

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.030
of this link, the tokar with its machine,

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.070
then we should take into account the opinion

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.260
of the developers of this

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.140
machine, the creators of this

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.180
machine, technological aspects

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.160
should take into account, what the

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.840
technologists say to us, up to

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.460
the point that we take into account,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.440
of course, and scientific all kinds

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.320
of technologies that are used

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.620
on this link, but at the same time

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.560
we must take into account the opinion

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.960
of the tokar itself, the

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.460
responsible executor on this

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.340
link of the project management process.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.280
In principle, no one else can

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.260
know how this machine is arranged,

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.380
how it works, its features, and

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.820
he can say a rational word about

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.960
improving the work of this

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.320
machine, about improving the

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.680
efficiency of the specifically

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.020
entrusted link that is part

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.900
of the project management

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.200
process.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.680
Thus, the corner is put

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.420
here, which we then began to

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.380
call personal, or as they say

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.240
in business, we must take

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.220
into account the human factor.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.140
It is interesting to note that Frederick

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:20.000
Taylor’s associate, Henry Gantt,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.360
who worked with Taylor at one

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.300
time, pointed to Taylor that Taylor

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.300
did not pay enough attention

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.400
to the human or personal

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.480
factor.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.420
And that this is a weak spot

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.720
in the methodological approach, which

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.980
was then transferred to the project activities.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.660
As for Gastev, we see that this is

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.540
a personal approach, it necessarily

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.760
takes into account, as we have

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.380
said, the human factor.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.040
And this is the main essence

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.280
of the distinction of Taylor’s approach,

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:12.300
or as they later began to say,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.080
personal approach.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.800
We call this approach in Russia

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.360
the Gastev approach.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:26.120
We see that Taylor’s approach

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.120
is being actively adjusted

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.240
in the West.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.280
These approaches now correct the side

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.140
of mandatory accounting of the

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.880
individual, the human factor, and they

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.780
are called a flexible approach.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.920
That is, in modern methods of

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.020
project management, including in

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.160
the West, approaches are used where

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.140
the conveyor or mechanical Taylor

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.720
approach and personal approach,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.200
which takes into account the

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.840
human factor, are combined.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.980
Russia is between the East and the West.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.700
Many say that Russia is at

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.360
the breakdown of two civilizations,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.440
but I still hold on to

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.340
the point of view of experts

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.180
who say that Russia is more

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.580
likely to be at a breakdown.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.660
In the field of management, in the

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.880
field of project management,

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.360
we use both Western and Eastern

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.820
approaches.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.720
From this point of view, of course,

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.640
it is interesting to look at

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.920
at least briefly, and what is being

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.700
done in the East.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.300
By the East we first understand

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.780
such present states

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.940
as South Korea, Japan,

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.680
China, Singapore and so on.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:02.600
Here we see that the project

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.720
activity is also developing very

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.700
extensively, and there are significant

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.560
successes.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.240
In general, one of the outstanding

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.940
achievements in management is associated

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.400
with the name of Confucius.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.540
And when we analyze the internal origins

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:30.340
of the specific approaches already existing,

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.040
the technologies of project

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.100
management in the East, we understand

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.180
that all this is one way or another

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.860
related, for example, with the philosophy

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.940
of Confucius, Confucianism.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.700
It is with the fact that the corner

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.420
here is placed, for example, the

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.420
achievement of harmony, family

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.940
values, which Confucius at one time

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.300
set out his approaches.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:05.080
It was built in the 5th century

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.360
before Christ.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.000
It is clear that there are many specifics

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.360
in the East, and this specificity

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.800
imposes its own characteristics on

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.340
design approaches.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.980
And when we look at project

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.840
management in Russia, we also see

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.280
that the East influences us,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.900
and the West influences us.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.780
And, of course, we take into account

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.400
our national characteristics, and we

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.140
see that Russia has its own approaches

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.560
in the field of project management.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.960
But, nevertheless, we see that

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.460
a large part of our business

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.880
uses Eastern project management

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.820
methods.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:00.780
For example, such techniques that

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.980
are used for economical production,

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.640
techniques that are used for

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.560
economical business, more

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.320
efficient project management,

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.580
these are techniques that

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.620
are now called Kaizen,

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.080
are widely used in

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.580
Japan, in the automotive

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.340
business, and so

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.060
on.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.020
Methods that say that we can make

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.860
a small amount of resources, effort

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:40.280
to lead to the fact that the

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.700
efficiency and results

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.500
of activities, including the

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.260
project, can be significantly

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.880
improved.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.420
In Russia, it is also used, often

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.900
this technology is linked with

00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.700
another, which is called the method

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.460
of economical production or

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.360
the method of economical

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.800
project activities.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.480
I will give a brief example from the

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.000
application of Kaizen technology in Russia.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.300
If we look at, for example,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.880
an information technology project,

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.480
I have seen from my practice

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:34.820
how Kaizen technologies

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.020
are used.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.580
Specifically, consider one of the

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.800
points of such a project on

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.280
the creation of a local computer network.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.680
The installation of the horizontal

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.280
CCC in the premises of the structured

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.460
cable system, which is part

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.040
of the local computing

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.680
system of the project as a whole.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:07.500
One of the installers, a very experienced

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.340
person, a professional of high

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.160
level, took the whole room and

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.620
the management entrusted him to

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.720
do this volume of work on his own.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.420
A person measures, very carefully,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.880
professionally, without making

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:33.120
unnecessary movements, goes

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.360
and makes a mark, makes a hole

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.260
for this horizontal

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.720
structured cable system

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.200
by a perforator.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.680
At the same time, if you look

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.300
from the side, and I was exactly

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.020
such an eyewitness, I had the

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.700
impression that a person just walks

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.080
along the wall and not quite

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.380
deliberately somehow strange

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.260
makes these holes a perforator.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.640
And, of course, from the side

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.040
of the external observer, this

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.100
looked very and very strange.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.080
When we approached this man, the

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.840
monter, he, though distracted from

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.820
his work, explained to us what

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.600
the essence was.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.220
It turns out, it goes very

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.220
measurably and confidently in length,

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.140
that is, along the wall measures

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.800
a certain distance through

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.540
which these holes should be applied.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.000
And in height he has a line on

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.520
his pants here, and he is along

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.340
a certain mark and makes these

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.560
holes.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.820
After understanding what the essence

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:59.740
of this approach is, we analyzed it and came

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.920
to the following conclusion.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.680
Instead of installers several

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.780
people long, using different tools

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.160
and so on, to apply these labels

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.680
first, and then start to do

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.380
holes perforator, you can take

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.320
this innovation and spread to

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.240
the entire scale of the enterprise,

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.720
which is engaged in the

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:36.060
installation of LWF or structured

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.960
cable systems, their

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.520
installation.

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.860
That is, as a result of this analysis,

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.180
the methodologists concluded that

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.860
it is necessary to apply these labels

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.060
on the clothes of all the installers,

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.180
to train these techniques,

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.000
and then the productivity

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.520
of the SCC installers

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.380
is significantly increased.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.080
The cost of this correction is very small,

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.380
and the result is tangible.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.860
This is one of the elements that is

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.760
used, for example, in the Kaiten.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:21.300
There are different options.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.400
It is interesting to note

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.200
that the Kaiten technology is often

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.720
combined with a technology that is often

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.100
called the Hochin Conry.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.000
And this technology, it is reduced to

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.320
the fact that when performing a particular

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.340
separate project, we must very clearly

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:48.320
align its goals, its business orientation

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.860
with the general business

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.080
strategy of the enterprise, with

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.720
the so-called business policy or

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.680
strategic development of business

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.360
at the given enterprise.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:08.640
If we talk about the keys, then, as

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.260
a rule, it is a tactical scale

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.380
of change or it is the scale

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.240
of tactical actions in the project activity.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.180
Hossein Conry is touching the strategy.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:27.600
He already this method relates

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.480
to working with strategy,

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.700
with strategic business goals.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.700
These two methods complement each other.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.480
If you look at the latest trends

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.980
in business development in China,

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.600
you can see that the significant

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:53.560
volume of GDP growth, the significant

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.840
volume of business production industry

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.180
in China, it is also related to

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.200
national features in China

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.040
and, above all, with such structures

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.720
of organizational structures

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.520
of enterprises, which

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.540
are called Tuang-shi.

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:23.920
This is a three-level structure and it

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.540
allows organizations with

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.040
three-level management to

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.600
implement significant business volumes.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.660
So what is the essence of

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.560
three-level management?

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.600
In being CEO, there is

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.740
the next level of manager

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.620
or project managers,

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.720
and the third level is performers.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.400
All, only three levels.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.960
In the West and Russia, as a rule,

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.020
the management structure or

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.880
organizational structure in

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.280
the enterprise is multi-level and

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.720
it can contain 8, 10, in

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.380
some organizations 12 levels.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.520
It is clear that in a multi-

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.260
level system we have a significant

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.700
amount of management

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.540
additional buildings, which

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:29.540
in some situations can lead

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.100
to a decrease in the efficiency

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.040
of activity, to a

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.740
decrease in the efficiency

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.420
of the project, if we consider

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.020
the organizational structure

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.000
of a particular

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.360
project.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:46.540
How is the interaction within the

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.180
project team?

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.940
If we take a multi-level structure,

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.920
it is clear that here we have a

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.260
significant portion of additional

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.260
actions that agree to pass on

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.380
the exact lines in the

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.960
practice of project management.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.200
This is called ballast costs or

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.640
ballast technologies, and we must

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.180
look very carefully

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.160
at the negative properties

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.240
of multi-level structures.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.160
In some multi-level organizations

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.860
there are 2-3 employees

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.360
at each level.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.740
If we take such a structure, in which

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.860
there are 2 employees on the same level

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.260
and we have 12 levels in total, then

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.140
it turns out that the entire staff of

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.520
the enterprise is equal to 2 in 12 degrees.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.860
That’s, if I’m not mistaken, more than

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:56.160
4000-4048 employees.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.840
If we take the three-level

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.020
enterprise structure that uses Tuang-

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:08.440
shi technology, then here at the

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.920
ratio between levels 1 to

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:16.680
50, we have the total enterprise

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.840
staff of 2,500.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.240
That is, at the top level,

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.100
one CEO, in his subordination

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.920
50 managers or managers,

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.520
and then each manager,

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520
each manager, 50 executives.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.200


01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.000
50 square to 2500 employees.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.520
Thus we see that in general the staff

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.220
is in the first case when we have

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.800
12 levels of management, and in the second

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.000
case when we have only 3 levels

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.160
of management the staff of the

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.940
enterprise is the same.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.060
This same ideology is reflected

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.340
in project management when

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.400
designing project teams.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.100
And it is understandable that

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.780
we, using Eastern methods, can come

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.820
to the fact that we will significantly

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.840
reduce management costs and thus

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.900
release resources for

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.380
direct work in the business in

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.200
the subject area.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.160
However, in the West, this approach is

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.220
not always acceptable, and in Russia,

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.440
too, it is not always optimal.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.480
And the reason is that in the East,

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.680
in particular, in China, when organizing

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.700
interaction in the project team,

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.140
when organizing interaction

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.400
in the team family values are used.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.200
Relationships are based on family

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.460
relationships.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:05.480
That is, if the head of the family

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.080
has made a decision and it is brought

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.940
to all members, then this decision

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.120
is performed optimally,

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.500
of course, and management or management

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.760
is very effective here.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:28.230
At the same time, the basis of

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:31.130
all relationships is

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.670
the principle of trust, trust.

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:38.710
The higher the trust, the less

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.910
we can use levels of control.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.550
In fact, if the level of trust is

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:48.990
high, then the project manager can

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.770
have at the same time in the

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.630
nearest interaction to be

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:56.530
even 50 people, as in the ideology

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.210
of Tuan Shi.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:03.030
But managing 50 people effectively

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:04.890
is possible if we really

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:07.250
have a very high level

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.910
of trust.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:12.890
On the other hand, if we have all of

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.870
these 50 of our closest employees,

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:19.570
professionals, if they can really

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:22.650
work independently and

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.650
qualitatively, in such a situation

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.710
we understand that in the Tuang-

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:32.150
shi ideology, the dominant are

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:34.490
not vertical links from

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.270
top to bottom, but horizontal

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:40.070
connections.

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:44.350
In general, if we approach the assessment

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:46.270
of project activities and

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.430
compare it with production, we

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:50.850
see that in the project activities

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.750
are in demand primarily horizontal

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:57.330
connections, in the production

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:59.990
activities vertical.

01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:02.490
The principle of cooperation

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:06.670
is used primarily in project activities.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:10.930
In the production sphere, where vertical

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:12.590
connections dominate, there

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:16.230
is the principle of management

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:19.270
or chief, the boss, the subordinate.

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:22.250
In project activities we can great

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.470
results, perform the project

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:26.750
more effectively if we approach the

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:29.510
organization of the project team

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:33.130
precisely from the point of

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.950
view of cooperation.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:39.350
Not using the principle of “I am the

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:43.250
boss, you are subordinate”, but using

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:47.950
the principle that we in the team

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.950
all cooperate to effectively

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:56.870
the project goal, effectively and

01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:01.270
qualitatively the project results,

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:05.350
results in such a way that we

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.330
have been fulfilled all the planning

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.410
parameters that we set at the very

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:13.610
beginning, starting the project,

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:16.950
namely project implementation time,

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.130
budget, resources used in general,

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.330
functional characteristics of

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:27.630
the result of the product

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.150
or service of the project, quality

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.950
requirements that are described

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:35.050
in the project documentation,

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:36.630
in project accounting

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.710
documentation and so

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.390
on.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:44.450
In this regard, the work of such

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:48.230
outstanding managers of the last

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:51.150
century as Edward Deming and Joseph

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:54.610
Juran are very interesting.

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:59.130
These professionals at one time approached

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:02.950
the process of quality management

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.870
of project activities very seriously,

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:07.550
they considered these processes

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:13.050
from different sides and created

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:16.330
the so-called approach of total

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:20.790
quality management, universal quality

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.130
management.

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:26.990
This is a sub-discipline

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:29.850
in project management.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:35.950
In the early 1950s, Deming was dealing

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.930
with these problems, he came

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:43.150
to Japan and started to implement

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:45.850
his ideas there.

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.430
If after World War II, production,

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.940
industry in Japan at the output

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:58.120
had products, the results are

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.720
not very high quality, then

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.120
in 20-25 years we see how much

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.060
the quality of Japanese

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.660
products has changed.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.040
And now the Japanese term in

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.600
many by default means high quality.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.840
This was done by Edward

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.020
Deming, one of the founders

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.420
of total quality management,

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.700
the general quality

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.840
management of the project.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.580
One of Deming's associates in

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.240
Japan was Kaoru Ishikawa.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:51.180
He also paid special attention

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.280
to his research, his work was of quality.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.960
And he has explored

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.700
causal relationships in project

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.720
management, in project management.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:09.080
He also approached project management

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.420
in a diverse way, he tried to facilitate

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:17.040
the activities of

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.880
project managers, managers.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.420
And he invented several very

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.420
interesting technologies that are

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.440
still successfully used in the

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.220
field of project management.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.360
One such technology will be introduced

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.760
later, when we, for example,

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.040
consider the risk management

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.340
section of the project, and

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.940
there we will use the

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.440
Ishikawa chart.
