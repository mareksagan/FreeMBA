00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I am reading to you today a very mysterious topic,

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
which is connected with the structure of capital, its price and risks,

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
which cause changes in the structure of capital in the economic life of any business.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
A few words about myself.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I have been engaged in financial work, financial thematics, for many years.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
I have been in the business for about 20 years,

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
starting from the position of the chief accountant of the heavy machinery plant.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
For three years I worked as a financial director in two companies

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
and headed the analytical center of the Moscow Control and Accounting Chamber,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
where the structure of capital plays a decisive role,

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
because the state structures are particularly concerned

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
about increasing the volume of loans due to budgetary means.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I have divided the structure of this topic into three modules.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
In the first module, which is dedicated to the concept of the structure of capital,

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I will talk about the problem of optimization or the choice of the rational structure of capital.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
We will look at the approaches that have been developed in practice

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
to feel the line for which the future borrowing destroys this business.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
You probably often hear that the whole world lives in debt.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And this is true.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
It is the borrowing that allows people to expand their investment opportunities,

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
to implement ambitious problems that are facing them at the moment, strategic plans.

02:01.000 --> 02:13.000
But the recent debt crisis in the United States still makes people understand

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
that there are objective borrowing boundaries,

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
which lead to bad results for both citizens and companies.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Therefore, there is an optimal structure of capital

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
that allows business to keep going and even develop.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
The most important thing is to understand what factors affect the structure of capital.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
You will see in textbooks such a definition of the structure of capital,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
a combination of debt and personal capital,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
which should be balanced by business assets every time.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
This is called the structure of capital.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
There is a slightly different definition.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
It is related to what I have just said.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
The structure of capital is a proportion of personal capital and borrowing,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
which has developed in a company at the moment.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
The differences are not fundamental.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
First, in the extensive interpretation of the structure of capital,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I do not talk about how long it takes.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Secondly, I talk only about the long-term debt related to the development of the business.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Let's see why we need to understand the structure of capital in this way.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
If we look at the structure of balance,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
which you have already seen in previous lessons,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
it becomes clear that in both parts of the balance,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
capital is represented in a special way.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
In the right part of the balance, the passive part,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
it is represented as the capital function.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
In this role, capital gives an idea of the structure of the business.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Who is behind this company?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
What are the responsibilities for the company that are threatening?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
All the ideas about the sources of financing can be seen in the right part of the balance.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
This is the capital function.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
But in this form, no one needs capital.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
It must give a return.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
It starts giving a return when we move to the left side of the balance.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Capital is represented as the capital function.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
The function of making new money.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
It is the left side of the balance that gives an idea of the profile of this business,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
of its financial complex.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Here we often find money.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
In the cash or at the account, which I mentioned.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
It is clear that this is not working money.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Therefore, it is not capital.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
The task of the financiers is to build the structure of capital,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
both in the active and passive part,

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
so that the presence of money will provide you with the current payment ability.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And capital gave the greatest return.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
The problem is that in the left part we find the current debt,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
which we call the debitory debt.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
In the right part, the creditory debt.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Here you can see the connection between the two definitions of the structure of capital.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
In normal conditions, the current debt,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
that is, we credit the business,

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
the reflection finds this operation in the debitory debt.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
We are credited, suppliers and contractors.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
This will be the creditory debt.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And in normal conditions, they are balanced.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
If we remove these two components from the left and right parts of the balance,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
then we will come to a rigid definition of the structure of capital.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Indeed, the proportions between the own and long-term borrowed sources.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But the difficulty is in what?

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
If there are not enough financial assets in the company's assets,

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
then the company will inevitably experience financial ruptures at certain points.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
That is, at the right time, there is simply not enough money to carry out some operations.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Or, as people sometimes say, a deficit of capital for development is found.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
On the other hand, if there are a lot of money,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
the company works with excess liquidity.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It is not active enough.

06:54.000 --> 07:04.000
Therefore, users of financial reporting, for which the company provides its data,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
will immediately react to this.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Therefore, when you decide to solve the case,

07:11.000 --> 07:21.000
pay close attention to how much money is rationally available in the business situation.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
If it is excess liquidity, then the amount of money should be brought to the norm,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
released and given simply to shareholders.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
This is their income, and you are fulfilling your mission.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
Or, if you find that you have a deficit of capital for development,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
then you simply cannot touch the cash.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Where do the original requirements for the structure of capital arise?

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
In any textbook on financial management, you will find that capital has functions.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
There are usually three of them.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
First, the capital itself should provide an adequate basis for the growth of the business.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
The second important function is that the capital should be in such a size

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
that the possible losses that occur from time to time in any business

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
can be absorbed and neutralized.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
Finally, the capital should be in such a size that in the event of bankruptcy,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
which is the pattern of the market economy,

08:39.000 --> 08:48.000
it can protect creditors and shareholders from serious losses.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
So, these are the three functions of capital.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
If you look closely at them in relation to each particular company,

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
you will see that the capital structure that the financiers should optimize is predetermined.

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
The importance of choosing a rational capital structure is determined by a number of conditions.

09:12.000 --> 09:21.000
For example, if a company has a capital structure that provides money to the external environment at a high price,

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
it immediately enters the limitation of its investment decisions.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
The demand for the profitability of the invested capital immediately becomes very high.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
The company becomes selective in choosing investments.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
That is, the company's investment opportunities immediately decrease.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
This is the first very important initial condition.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
The second one is that there are often additional limitations on investment opportunities.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
The company cannot respond flexibly enough to the challenges of the external environment,

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
it becomes manoeuvrable in competition, and very often it simply gets out of competition.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
The concern for the flexibility of the business is considered the number one concern today.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Finally, if the proportion of the borrowed capital is not optimal,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
internal conflicts often arise.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
They are often called professional conflicts or agency conflicts.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
Between the management, that is, the higher management of the company, and the owners or shareholders.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Between the owners and creditors.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
These conflicts greatly reduce the investment opportunities of the business, if they begin.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
Therefore, if such a conflict has arisen in the company at the moment,

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
there is no question of additional capital attractions.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It just cannot happen.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
We should forget about it before these conflicts disappear.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Otherwise, the value of capital will simply destroy your business.

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
A very important concept related to the choice of the rational structure of capital is the sufficiency of capital.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Let me tell you about such a case from practice.

11:27.000 --> 11:36.000
It is clear that the problem of the sufficiency of capital arises when we think about the coming financial year.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
How much does the company want to earn?

11:40.000 --> 11:52.000
It is clear that in order to increase the income, additional assets are needed.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
In order to purchase additional assets, additional money is needed.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
And from this, the conflict of these circumstances immediately forms the criteria of the sufficiency of the capital.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
How much capital is needed for the coming year to ensure the planned income?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Pay attention to the slide.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
The capital itself is equal to the net profit minus the bracket R minus I.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
This is a very significant term in finance.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
The profitability of assets calculated on net profit or economic profitability is often called.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
And this value characterizes the debt rate.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
At what price does the firm receive the debt sources?

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
The difference in this bracket is multiplied by the amount of the long-term debt.

12:52.000 --> 13:11.000
If you look closely at the formula calculator, the load on the capital itself is either net profit or net profit.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
But here the problem arises.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
The value in the bracket can change the sign.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
That is, R minus I can change the sign.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
Suddenly, if the value in the bracket is negative, the minus gives a plus.

13:28.000 --> 13:38.000
Thus, the attraction of loans in this situation only aggravates the demand for one's own capital.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
The load on net profit increases even more.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
How much asset is required to obtain this amount of profit?

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
To do this, it is enough to divide net profit by economic profitability.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
And we will get the amount of additional financing in the form of a long-term debt.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
We will see this expression in the bracket more than once.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
It is desirable that all listeners remember the economic nature of this expression.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
A number of important consequences arise from this formula.

14:16.000 --> 14:28.000
The planned profit is achievable only if the additional payment from these assets increases the profit.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
In this case, the increase in assets due to debt is economically justified.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
This is where the statement that the whole world lives in debt comes from.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
What is the exact amount of asset growth needed?

14:43.000 --> 14:52.000
To do this, we simply need to divide the amount of profit we want to obtain by economic profitability.

14:52.000 --> 15:06.000
Obviously, if R minus I, the need to finance this business in terms of one's own capital, increases enormously,

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
the load will be solely on net profit.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
So, if we look at the economic meaning of the bracket,

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
multiplied by the amount of long-term debt divided by economic profitability,

15:28.000 --> 15:39.000
the amount of financial resources that companies need to compensate in risky conditions will not be economically justified.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Here is an example from practice.

15:42.000 --> 15:52.000
One of the well-known companies located in Moscow is the shareholder society, the Institute of Hydro Projects.

15:53.000 --> 16:04.000
This is a complex and very strong economic formation represented by three branches in Russia,

16:04.000 --> 16:13.000
located in different places, starting from the Caucasus and ending in Eastern Siberia.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
And three branches abroad, the most powerful in India.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
You probably heard that Russia won a tender for the construction of the GSTERI in India,

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
and the Institute was the participant of this tender.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
Therefore, the branch abroad was of great importance in the fate of this company.

16:38.000 --> 16:47.000
It would seem that a well-known company with a long economic history, which has been working steadily for many years,

16:47.000 --> 17:01.000
should have its own capital in such a size to insure such a complex structure of its business from various disorders.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
But here is what happened.

17:05.000 --> 17:17.000
At one point, a very bad signal came from a subsidiary company located in Eastern Siberia.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
The company had great debts to the tax authorities.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
The tax authorities soon learned that there was a head office in Moscow,

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
and all the claims to the subsidiary company were sent to the head office.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
And this is where the problem of capital sufficiency arose for the first time in this company.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
If all the debts of this subsidiary company were paid by the tax authorities,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
the Institute could have been closed.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
Why? Because the company never talked about the sufficiency of capital.

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
But if we consider the function of capital, it should be in such a size

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
that the company could insure all the economic disorders of its structural subdivisions.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
This risk was not included in the established capital of this company.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Therefore, it was necessary to urgently change the structure of capital,

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
increase the long-term loans, restructure, take up tax debts,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
and gradually pay off the debts and leave the company afloat.

18:35.000 --> 18:46.000
What factors affect the choice of the rational structure of capital?

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
First, the external environment in the conditions of globalization plays a huge role.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
The capital markets are connected all over the world today.

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
If you pay attention, our stock indexes on the main platforms of the IMF and the RTS have sharply fallen.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
There were no internal reasons for the fall of the stock prices.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
It turned out that the fall of the stock prices in the United States

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
on the platforms of the major Asian companies

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
has brought the fall of the stock prices in Russia.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So what is behind this?

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
A number of companies were forced to abandon all decisions on the optimization of the capital structure,

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
to stop their programs of going to the exchange platforms

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
in order to attract additional money from the placement of the IPO program,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
and to wait for the favorable moment.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
If you look at this slide, you will see two groups of factors.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
The left side of the slide gives an idea of the factors that form the capital structure.

20:06.000 --> 20:18.000
If they prevail in this business, you put the priority of your own financing of this business.

20:18.000 --> 20:30.000
And vice versa, if the factors that are described in the right side of the slide prevail,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
you put the priority of your own financing of this business.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
So, the instability of the economic environment.

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
If this is found, the company puts the priority of its own financing.

20:47.000 --> 21:01.000
And vice versa, if the environment is favorable, the company puts the priority of its own financing.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
But here we should keep in mind that the economic environment or the level of stability of the economic environment

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
pre-determines the so-called investment period in each specific country.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And based on the definition of the capital structure,

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
we talked about the ratio or the proportion of the own and long-term borrowers,

21:22.000 --> 21:32.000
what is the long-term borrower in the world of this reason of the formation of the capital structure.

21:32.000 --> 21:41.000
Until recently, literally 2-3 years ago, the investment period of Russia did not exceed the frame of 3 years.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
Therefore, if you pay attention, the basic characteristics of our bonds were 3-year bonds.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
Although the Western world or the companies that place their bonds on developed stock exchanges

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
immediately claim from 5 and more years.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Here is the difference in the investment climate, in the conditions of the external environment

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
and the structure of the capital that the company can afford.

22:14.000 --> 22:22.000
A very important value in the structure of the capital is the lifetime of the company.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
The company is just starting its own business.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
It is clear that no one will give it serious money in debts,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
and therefore all hope is on its own source of financing.

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
If the company has a history, it expands, then of course such a company will be able to finance its debt.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
It will be burdened with debts, the turnover expands,

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
more and more money is required to maintain the business's power,

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
and hence, of course, the tendency to long-term financing is obvious and justified.

22:55.000 --> 23:05.000
A lot of things in the choice of the structure of the capital are determined by the qualifications of the financial services of this company.

23:05.000 --> 23:15.000
It should be understood that borrowing or attracting debt sources for financing is a very complex financial transaction.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
It requires a huge amount of knowledge, requirements for debt financing,

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
and criteria that determine the rate of debt financing.

23:26.000 --> 23:36.000
If the financiers are not qualified enough, then of course the capital will be very expensive for them,

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
and most likely they will be burdened with their own sources of financing.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
On the contrary, if the company has a very high financial culture,

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
then it is not difficult to enter the capital market, and the company can easily attract borrowing capital.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
An important factor in determining the structure of capital is the level of financial dependence.

24:04.000 --> 24:14.000
What is it? It is the ratio of the own and borrowed funds, which is equal.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
But most often, and you will notice it in the books,

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
it is written that the ratio of 50 to 50, that is, 50 own and 50 borrowed funds,

24:25.000 --> 24:37.000
is the necessary level of financial independence, that is, the equality of own and borrowed funds.

24:37.000 --> 24:51.000
If the company has this ratio, then of course it is limited in the possibilities of further expansion of financial dependence,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
and it will be burdened with its own capital.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
And vice versa, if the ratio of debt and own capital is far from the 50 to 50 limit,

25:01.000 --> 25:10.000
then of course the company can afford to increase the volume of debt sources and expand its turnover at this expense.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
It will be burdened with debt financing.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
A very important factor in determining the structure of capital is the limitation of the financial resources.

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
Either they are limited in the national capital market, or access to them is not limited.

25:29.000 --> 25:41.000
If there are limitations, then our market history of Russia is based on the fact that we have always had a sharp deficit of debt financing sources.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
In the conditions of limitation, of course, the company will be burdened with its own financing.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
And vice versa, if the access to the capital market is free, the company will be happy to borrow,

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
and the cost of borrowing will not be catastrophic for it.

25:58.000 --> 26:08.000
You have probably heard a lot of talk in recent years about the fact that the company should be open to the outside world.

26:08.000 --> 26:18.000
That is, references that your information is confidential, close the doors to you on the capital market.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
No one will talk to you about borrowing.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
And vice versa, in the conditions of transparency of financial information that you give to the outside world,

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
of course, investors and creditors have the opportunity to assess your risks, your financial needs,

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
your possible return on investment of financial resources.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
And, of course, the access to debt financing of such a company is open.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
A very important value in determining the tendency to either debt financing or own financing

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
determines how you feel about the implementation of investment projects.

27:00.000 --> 27:10.000
If the company is talking about the implementation of projects related to the minimization of costs for the attraction of capital,

27:10.000 --> 27:18.000
that is, the minimum cost is the main condition for the implementation of this investment project.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Often such investments are called mandatory.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Apparently, when you studied this topic, you talked about them.

27:26.000 --> 27:35.000
Of course, companies with such investment projects should rely exclusively on their own sources of financing.

27:35.000 --> 27:46.000
And vice versa, if the investment portfolio of the company is rich, it has several promising investment projects in turn,

27:46.000 --> 27:54.000
and if we are talking about the payable costs for the implementation of the money attracted for these projects,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
then here the financial work begins.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
Here, the work to find the optimal structure of capital is a very important block of financial activity,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
and the company will, of course, be happy to attract debt financing.

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
Finally, a very important value in choosing the structure of capital is the profile of each particular company.

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
As they say, if a company is mastering some pioneering projects,

28:23.000 --> 28:32.000
that is, it has innovative ideas that give it competitive advantages,

28:33.000 --> 28:45.000
but you understand that any pioneering project or any innovation is associated with a huge risk of their future success.

28:45.000 --> 28:54.000
It is impossible to calculate in advance all the consequences of the implementation of such an innovation project.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Therefore, in the initial period of implementation of this project,

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
it is possible to talk exclusively about the sources of financing.

29:01.000 --> 29:13.000
And you probably noticed how difficult it is for companies to attract money from the environment.

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
They can be given money by specialists of a special profile,

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
that is, venture capitalists who understand the meaning of innovative projects

29:26.000 --> 29:34.000
and will provide the corresponding money for a share of participation in this business.

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
In this case, we are talking about financing an innovative project or a pioneering project exclusively at the expense of their own capital.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
And the situation is completely different when the business profile is associated with a traditional product.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
But imagine a business, a fashionable housing construction.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
Of course, if there is a product of this kind,

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
then such a company will be given credits and release of bonds.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
And it will not be difficult to apply for such a company.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
That is, it will be directed to debt financing.

30:12.000 --> 30:20.000
Why? Because its product is a very good collateral for any debt.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
And therefore, the path to debt financing of such a company is open.

30:24.000 --> 30:35.000
An audience or a student who has no idea about the problem of capital management,

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
and the structure of capital is one of the problems of this field,

30:42.000 --> 30:52.000
can imagine the path of choosing a rational structure of capital for a particular company.

30:52.000 --> 31:00.000
If they carefully group these factors, which determine the tendency to either debt or their own financing,

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
and thus build an acceptable structure of capital for this business.

31:07.000 --> 31:14.000
But what is difficult in optimizing the structure of capital?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Why is this problem so acute?

31:17.000 --> 31:25.000
It was put on the line in the 50s and 60s of the 20th century by two outstanding financiers of the 20th century,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Miller and Modigliani, Nobel laureates.

31:28.000 --> 31:38.000
After they published their famous article on the structure of capital in 1958,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
the financial world exploded.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
Since then, there has been no more active discussion.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
They made such a statement.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
The success of a business, its value does not depend on the structure of capital,

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
does not depend on the dividend policy, everything is determined by the internal profitability of the business.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
So, the structure of capital does not have a fundamental value,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
all the attention is on the profitability of this business,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
that is, the return of investors to capital.

32:15.000 --> 32:22.000
They proved brilliantly, based on the original assumptions,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
why their statement was justified.

32:26.000 --> 32:38.000
The world began a long discussion of various options for the implementation of the business financing strategy proposed by these outstanding financiers.

32:38.000 --> 32:46.000
The first reproach that scientists made to them was that they did not take into account the tax burden.

32:46.000 --> 32:56.000
That is, they neglected taxes, there were no tax factors in the original restrictions,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
and therefore came to this conclusion.

32:59.000 --> 33:06.000
If you look closely at the nature of debt financing,

33:06.000 --> 33:14.000
everyone understands that there was a loan many centuries ago,

33:14.000 --> 33:32.000
but the nature of debt financing in our topic is that it dates back to the time when the economy based on capital received its highest prosperity.

33:32.000 --> 33:41.000
If you look closely at how the tax factor affects the structure of capital, you will find out.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Why do people take money into debt?

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
Because the interest rate for the debt financing is related to the costs,

33:52.000 --> 34:02.000
which reduce the tax revenue, and therefore the tax on revenue in the budget becomes less.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.000
Experts say that we include a tax shield in the case of debt financing,

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
that is, we protect part of the profit of the manufacturer from the tax inspection.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
The question is, if we are talking about taxes,

34:18.000 --> 34:30.000
then at first glance it is not profitable for the state to give permission to entrepreneurs to pay interest on their debts.

34:30.000 --> 34:41.000
Nevertheless, it can be safely said that this is a fundamental and original message on which the world of capitalism stands today.

34:41.000 --> 34:53.000
The government deliberately gives permission to entrepreneurs to pay interest on their expenses in order to activate the entrepreneurial spirit in society.

34:53.000 --> 35:03.000
In this case, the mass of income is important, not the interest that will go into the budget from the income received.

35:04.000 --> 35:13.000
It turns out that the state is the ultimate beneficiary of all the benefits of business from debt financing, that is, the state budget.

35:13.000 --> 35:26.000
It is clear why the term developing economy or transitional economy has a right to life.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
Recall our recent Russian experience.

35:31.000 --> 35:40.000
In the 1990s, only a part of the company's interest payments had the right to pay for expenses.

35:40.000 --> 35:49.000
That is, only a part of the expenses for capital could be deducted from the investment.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
This is the discrepancy that prevents the development of such an economy.

35:56.000 --> 36:03.000
This is the first characteristic of the transitional economy.

36:04.000 --> 36:22.000
Even today, after 15 years of the construction of the market economy, Russia is not yet ready to allow its entrepreneurs to pay interest on their expenses.

36:22.000 --> 36:33.000
There is a limit to the refinancing rate of the Central Bank, which today is 10%, multiplied by 1.1%.

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
If your interest payments are worth more than this rate, then this excess is considered a net profit.

36:41.000 --> 36:53.000
Even today, although we are recognized as a country with a market economy, we cannot say that we have not met this requirement.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
The echoes of the transitional economy still remain in Russia.

36:59.000 --> 37:08.000
The tax rate will save a part of the company's remaining profits.

37:08.000 --> 37:26.000
In this case, the company's aspiration to maximize its profitability and increase the wealth of shareholders will always be focused on increasing the debt financing.

37:26.000 --> 37:36.000
The growth of the source of financing, the higher turnover, the higher the profit, the greater the wealth of the company.

37:36.000 --> 37:47.000
So, profitability as a basic financial parameter has a decisive role in determining the structure of capital and in its optimization procedures.

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
The second problem associated with the optimization of the structure of capital is caused by the parameter of liquidity.

37:55.000 --> 38:08.000
This is the most complex parameter of financial science, which still does not allow many financial concepts to be implemented in practical activity.

38:08.000 --> 38:23.000
The second half of the 20th century, starting with the discoveries of Miller and Modigliani, and ending with the latest achievements in financial science, is sometimes called the golden age of finance.

38:23.000 --> 38:33.000
This is true. There are a huge number of outstanding discoveries, for which Nobel Prize winners were awarded.

38:33.000 --> 38:44.000
But the most interesting thing is that all the awards concerned profitability and risk.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Liquidity has always been beyond the boundaries of the theory of even the greats.

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
This problem still stands before the financiers.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
Why is the parameter of liquidity so difficult to implement in the structure of capital?

39:06.000 --> 39:25.000
As we often understand, liquidity is the ratio of current assets, money, assets, and production reserves.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
These are short assets with a short life span.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
These are current assets.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
We said that they are equated with current debts, with current liabilities.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
The ratio of current assets and liabilities is greater than 1.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
It is said that liquidity is fine.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But what is liquidity about?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Is it about balance or financial liquidity?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Liquidity should be understood more broadly.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Liquidity is the ability of goods or assets to be sold.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Can it be realized for real money or not?

40:05.000 --> 40:14.000
If you look at the structure of revenue of any company, you can immediately make an idea of its liquidity.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
Either the company gets money ahead, or it has a huge debit rate.

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
The company can only sell, and when it gets money, it's a different story.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
If the company falls into such conditions, then, of course, we can't talk about high liquidity.

40:38.000 --> 40:47.000
The double interpretation of the parameter of liquidity immediately causes a lot of difficulties in optimizing the structure of capital.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
And finally, there is a risk.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
In the conditions of the market economy, the extreme risks are quite specific.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Bankruptcy of this company.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.000
Even in a prosperous America, at least 50,000 companies become bankrupt every year.

41:05.000 --> 41:19.000
I mean only businesses that work in the white, like One Day Bank and other black business representatives are not taken into account.

41:19.000 --> 41:26.000
That is, these are conscientious entrepreneurs, who, under certain circumstances, fall into such a risk band that they can't cope with it.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Bankruptcy.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
This is the third parameter that directly affects the optimization of the structure of capital.

41:32.000 --> 41:42.000
And in the future, we will look closely at how to take into account the influence of each individual factor in the process of optimizing the structure of capital.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
What is the optimal structure of capital?

41:45.000 --> 41:53.000
This is the ratio of borrowed capital, where the minimum total costs for attracting capital are achieved.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Or the average costs for capital.

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
Keep in mind that the cost of capital and the costs for capital are synonyms.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
In different books, they say different words, but they are the same.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
So keep in mind every time you read different books.

42:09.000 --> 42:18.000
So, this is the structure of capital that allows additional sources of financing at a minimum rate.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
What is the complexity of solving this problem in the real world?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It is complex in itself.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And it includes the problem of capital sufficiency.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
You have seen this problem in the formula, and I told you about it on a specific example.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
This problem is related to the provision of the necessary financial reserves.

42:40.000 --> 42:48.000
The problem is the share of debt in the structure of capital, which always provides additional profitability to the company.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
The second determining limitation.

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
Finally, the share of your own capital, which determines the creditability of the company.

42:58.000 --> 43:09.000
It is clear that if you have a standardized business with a product that can be invested by a creditor,

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
then the problem of creditability falls into the background.

43:14.000 --> 43:22.000
And if not, then you can only insure your own creditability with your own capital.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Hence the problem of its share.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
And finally, the price of capital, the average cost of capital.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
This is also one of the problems of optimization.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
And it plays a fundamental role in a developing business.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
In fact, the price of capital determines the lower limit of the attractiveness of investment projects.

43:43.000 --> 43:51.000
If suddenly the return of an investment project is lower than the attractiveness of financing,

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
then the final fate of the project will be deplorable.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
The financing scheme itself will destroy its effectiveness.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
This is the complex nature of the problem of capital structure optimization.

44:08.000 --> 44:19.000
But even listing these factors does not speak of many important things that determine the optimal structure of capital.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
It is often said that even if we are talking about a long-term debt,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
what is its subject diversification?

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
That is, the disengagement between business subjects.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
One thing is that we take a loan in a bank, one subject, right?

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
There is no debt diversification in this case.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
And if I issue bonds or VIX, they diverge from a huge number of buyers.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
The business in this case has a diversified debt structure.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
It is clear that the diversified structure and the collected debts in one place

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
are two completely different qualities of debt.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
This should always be taken into account when determining the optimal structure of capital.

45:13.000 --> 45:24.000
There are many examples of the impact of subject diversification on the success or failure of individual economies.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
The most famous example is the Asian problem of debt financing.

45:30.000 --> 45:40.000
We know that the advanced economy of Japan was in a state of stagnation for 10 years.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Now it is barely getting out of this state.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
This is because it had a bank-oriented economy.

45:48.000 --> 45:58.000
That is, there was a strong interweaving of debt financing with the help of banks and the production business.

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
Therefore, if interest rates are unfavorable for a period of time,

46:06.000 --> 46:14.000
lending in such conditions immediately becomes difficult.

46:14.000 --> 46:26.000
If this is a systemic form of business financing, then the national economy itself begins to stagnate.

46:26.000 --> 46:40.000
The problem of debt financing in China is very difficult to solve, despite the fact that China has joined the WTO.

46:40.000 --> 46:51.000
China is actively developing its new financial system,

46:51.000 --> 46:59.000
prioritizing state banks, withdrawing bad loans from business,

46:59.000 --> 47:17.000
and actively expanding the stock market.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
The funders are growing rapidly in China.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
This transition is not yet complete.

47:23.000 --> 47:31.000
The formation of an optimal capital structure for Chinese enterprises or for the Russian business,

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
which works with Chinese agents, is always difficult.

47:36.000 --> 47:43.000
The same subject diversification is assumed in relation to one's own capital.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
The AFK system is very well-known in Moscow.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
It is a very advanced and rich company.

47:51.000 --> 48:01.000
Recently, it entered the capital market to place additional shares, i.e. to implement the IPO program.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
The first attempt was unsuccessful.

48:05.000 --> 48:19.000
The structure of the internal capital was built in such a way that the shareholder had more than 80% of the company's fixed capital.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
The fund market allows for no more than 70% in one hand.

48:26.000 --> 48:33.000
Therefore, the internal structure of the capital had to be changed in order to be able to enter the fund market.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
They succeeded.

48:35.000 --> 48:44.000
But, as you can see, they had to diversify the structure of their capital in such an original way.

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
What approaches have been developed in the world of science and practice in terms of optimizing the structure of capital?

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
The most popular approach is called the compromise or traditional method.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Pay attention to this slide.

48:58.000 --> 49:06.000
If I look at the coordinates of the price of capital and the financial dependence, i.e. the structure of capital,

49:06.000 --> 49:16.000
I will see how the structure of capital and its value will be formed, depending on what money I attract to the development of the business.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
The upper curve characterizes the capital itself.

49:21.000 --> 49:34.000
It is customary to think that since the very development of the business, its expansion, increase in debt dependence, i.e. the increase in debt and capital itself,

49:34.000 --> 49:42.000
the value of the capital has been increasing evenly, while the total value of the capital has been gradually decreasing.

49:42.000 --> 49:56.000
It is clear that the larger the amount of debt sources in the structure of capital, the more you save on the tax rate, and therefore the value of the capital decreases.

49:56.000 --> 50:09.000
But pay attention to the fact that during the development or at a certain stage of the life cycle, you enter a phase when both your own capital and the debt for the company become more expensive.

50:09.000 --> 50:18.000
The first person among the scientists who noticed this situation, in a dispute with the first-time researchers Miller and Modigliani, was Durand.

50:18.000 --> 50:25.000
He observed dozens of large American firms and discovered this thing.

50:25.000 --> 50:39.000
He said that up to a certain point, the value of the capital or the average value of the capital, the average cost of capital, decreases.

50:39.000 --> 50:49.000
And only after some point, the value of the source of financing increases.

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
This means that there is an optimal structure of capital that must be adhered to.

50:56.000 --> 51:13.000
If an entrepreneur felt this line, saw that the cost of money went up, he must return to the previous situation and accept that this is the optimal structure of capital for him.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.000
This is why this traditional method of optimization is written in every textbook.

51:19.000 --> 51:31.000
This concept is not strictly scientific, because it is impossible to mathematically calculate this point of the fracture when the cost of capital begins to increase.

51:31.000 --> 51:46.000
The uniqueness of each firm, and all firms are unique, does not give a chance to mathematically express the point of the fracture.

51:46.000 --> 51:55.000
In practice, the structure of capital is often optimized by purely operational profits.

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
What is the point? Of course, the desire for profit is and will be the rational goal of any business.

52:02.000 --> 52:18.000
The theory states that with the increase of borrowed funds in the structure of capital, investors and creditors do not realize the risk of the company increasing.

52:18.000 --> 52:25.000
The firm works, shows good turnover, so it does not cause much concern.

52:25.000 --> 52:38.000
As a result, the cost of borrowed funds remains constant, does not change from time to time, and, of course, raises the total profit of the company.

52:39.000 --> 52:57.000
Because investors do not realize the increasing risk, they are satisfied with the increase in the profit, and they hope for a multiple return on investment of debt sources in the increase of profit.

52:57.000 --> 53:07.000
Their ultimate goal is realized, and they encourage the increase of the use of borrowed funds in this company.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
What is the conclusion? Yes, everyone is satisfied.

53:13.000 --> 53:25.000
By using borrowed funds, you can reduce the price of your capital, increase the value of the company for shareholders, but everything is up to time.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
There is one very important assumption that should always be taken into account.

53:30.000 --> 53:48.000
We said that at some point in time, the expansion of the financial volume does not cause concern for creditors or shareholders, but the increase in financial dependence still occurs, and therefore the financial risks increase.

53:49.000 --> 54:03.000
In this case, the growth of turnover is ignored, and the business risk is ignored, which is associated with the transformation of the marginal profit into the operational profit.

54:04.000 --> 54:13.000
But in the future we will show that both the financial and business risks act simultaneously, they do not work separately.

54:13.000 --> 54:22.000
This assumption also doubts the optimality of this method, its scientific evidence.

54:22.000 --> 54:30.000
Still, some experience and intuition are present in optimizing the structure of capital in this method.

54:30.000 --> 54:43.000
There is another method recognized by science, I believe it is the most scientific proof.

54:43.000 --> 54:50.000
The method of operational profit. If we are talking about purely operational profit, then we are talking about the overall operational profit.

54:50.000 --> 55:02.000
This method is widely used in practice, because it explains the situation for any company, the probability of bankruptcy.

55:02.000 --> 55:14.000
Comparing the profit earned by the operational profit with a certain criterion of bankruptcy, and there are many such models of determining the probability of bankruptcy in science today.

55:14.000 --> 55:25.000
One of the most popular models is Altman. If I take the five-factor model of Altman, I will calculate the probability of bankruptcy for my company.

55:25.000 --> 55:33.000
I got 2.9, this is the limit that cannot be crossed.

55:33.000 --> 55:40.000
But in the model of the structure of capital, the probability of bankruptcy is calculated, and the structure of capital is involved.

55:40.000 --> 55:49.000
If I got such a probability of bankruptcy, then further increase in the structure of capital is simply impossible.

55:49.000 --> 56:06.000
My operational profit will not be enough to pay off all the debts of the company in the coming year.

56:06.000 --> 56:18.000
What debts are we talking about? The main operational profit is the profit before the payment of interest and taxes.

56:18.000 --> 56:31.000
It is clear that this is the format of profit, because bankruptcy is expressed in debt, so the profit before the payment of taxes is taken.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
The second component for comparison is the debt load on the profit.

56:37.000 --> 56:45.000
The amount of the main debt plus the interest for this debt within one year.

56:45.000 --> 56:51.000
Sometimes this amount is called a two-part financial debt.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
This term is often used in textbooks.

56:56.000 --> 57:05.000
The condition of bankruptcy for any year is as follows.

57:05.000 --> 57:12.000
The profit before the payment of interest and taxes is less than the debt load on the profit.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
This is the condition of bankruptcy.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
If the company enters this stage, the debt load must be reduced immediately.

57:21.000 --> 57:31.000
It is clear that the concept of bankruptcy, as the most clear from the point of view of business,

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
opens the method of optimization of the structure of capital,

57:37.000 --> 57:46.000
the means of operational profit, as the most understandable to the practicing financiers.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
The method has two assumptions.

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
First, the character of the distribution of future profit is not taken into account.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
We took the profit before the payment of interest and taxes.

58:00.000 --> 58:08.000
And suddenly the company has a privileged share, a guaranteed dividend,

58:08.000 --> 58:15.000
so some of the profit must be sent to pay these dividends.

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
But, as we see, this limitation is not provided in the initial shipments.

58:21.000 --> 58:28.000
If it is, then the conditions of bankruptcy must be explained separately.

58:28.000 --> 58:37.000
The profit before the payment of interest and taxes must be reduced to the amount of guaranteed payments.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
The second limitation that also causes concern of the practicing financiers

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
is that the operational profit does not depend on the level of the financial lever.

58:47.000 --> 58:54.000
We will see later that this is not the case, and therefore it is dangerous to ignore this assumption.

58:55.000 --> 59:04.000
What is the relationship between the price of capital and the price of the company?

59:10.000 --> 59:19.000
In general, the price of capital is often equal to the ratio of expenses associated with the extraction of capital,

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
the percentage of dividends, other forms of payment for the extraction of capital,

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
often called financial costs, and the amount of resources attracted.

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
One divided into another, expressed in percents, and this is how the price of capital is determined.

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
The price of capital and the expense of capital are synonyms,

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
so if you see one or the other name in the books, keep in mind that they are the same.

59:49.000 --> 01:00:02.000
They say that by using debt-based financing, you can earn a lot of income and at the same time hold on to the float for a long time.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
This is actually true.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:15.000
In Moscow, there is a well-known company Radon, a large company that collects and utilizes nuclear waste,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
in the area of Sergiu Posada.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:28.000
The financing of this company is mixed, it is allocated money from the federal budget, from the budget of Moscow,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
and of course, the company's services are not free, so there are also your own earned income.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:45.000
That is, such a complex structure of financing, but you need to understand one simple thing.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000
One thing is the source of financing on paper, and the second is at what rate they enter a particular business.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Imagine a situation, allocated from the federal budget, let's say, 50 million rubles for the coming financial year.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
You can get money on January 15, and you can get money on July 15, or even later.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Therefore, the period when the source of financing enters a particular business, already determines the possibility of insuring this financial gap.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
The first thing that comes to mind, and so the company Radon acted in its life, is to attract debt money, debt financing sources.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
A suitable bank is chosen, and here are possible options.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You can just take a one-time loan for a financial gap, this is one situation, and you can open a credit line.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The choice of various ways of debt financing allows you to either conduct a debt policy within the framework of a civilized business,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
or build, as in the case of the extreme, a financial pyramid.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This is what Radon did. After the check of the Moscow Accounting Chamber, a huge financial pyramid was revealed.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
The company worked, nothing threatened at first glance.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But who was the guarantor in the last instance of payments for this financial pyramid in the event of its collapse?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Of course, the Moscow government. As soon as this became known, a number of restrictions were immediately adopted by the Moscow City Council,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and the guarantors were immediately assigned to the Moscow government, and the budget structure was incorporated.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
A number of restrictions were made.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Here is how the construction of a certain capital structure affects its value, and the reaction of the owners or managers of this business to the exit from this situation.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Why did Radon's capital price soar?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It is clear that you have to pay for convenience.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
One thing is a one-time loan, and the other is a credit line.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000
That is, at any time, in the event of a financial collapse, a certain level of access to debt financing is always open.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
For this convenience, you have to pay.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Therefore, the cost of the loan in the form of a credit line was at least two times higher than the Central Bank's refinancing rate.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:12.000
This is the influence of the capital structure and the form of debt financing on the capital price.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The second factor that takes part in the formation of the capital price policy is the time cost of money.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The time factor is taken into account in the cost of money.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Today's money is much more expensive than money in a year, two, three, and with the help of discounting, we take into account the time cost of money.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
The next factor that determines the price of capital is the risk level.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Each company, as we said, is unique.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Therefore, the internal structure of business and financial risks is distributed differently.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And the assessment of capital depends on how much emphasis is placed on one or the other side, namely, on the business or financial risk.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Imagine a simple situation.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
The business risk of a company is huge.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Can a company afford a high financial risk related to debt financing?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Of course not.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Therefore, the structure of capital will be predetermined.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
From here, its cost is determined.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And vice versa.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
A company with a small business risk can afford a higher financial risk.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
The key role in determining the price of capital is the state of the capital market.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You can often hear that the market is always right.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
In a sense, this is true.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The truth is that the market is represented by a huge number of different participants, creditors, investors.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
They study the situation of companies that ask for financing sources.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
They say that almost everything is known about this company.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That is, they minimize a huge amount of information about this company, about its relations with counteragents,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000
the logic of behavior with investors, whether they pay dividends or do it irregularly.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
The market knows all this.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
From here, an average value of capital is formed.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It is a bar that determines the value of capital for each particular company.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
How is the task of assessing the price of capital solved?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It is clear that, based on the structure of capital,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
if the task of attracting additional funds for development is set,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
the shareholder capital, that is, the structure of power in this company, should not be washed away.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
This task can be solved only with the help of debt financing.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:08.000
The capital market evaluates the need for a company in debt financing

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and will determine its level of financial, production or business risk.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
This is also a synonym.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
From here, a certain value of borrowing for a particular company is formed.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Combining the value of one's own capital and debt financing,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
one can determine the average cost of capital.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
This is the value of capital for a particular company.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
How to determine the value of capital for any company?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:53.000
We know that there are two different sources of capital financing in calculation.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Debt financing, loan, interest, bonds, and so on.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And the share of participation or shareholding in the company management.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Stocks, shares and other forms.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The combination of these two sources of financing allows us to determine the total value of capital for a particular company.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
What do I do in this case?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Without going into detail about the share of each source of financing in the total structure of capital,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I determine the value of each source separately.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I determine the value of the loan, the value of the bond, and so on.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I evaluate the shares separately.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And then, having received two assessments, I look at their mutual influence.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Mutual influence is always there.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
How will the mutual influence of two prices affect the final assessment of the company?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
This is a tedious analytical work that must be done every time the sources taken separately are calculated.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:17.000
When I have done all this, I put the final conclusions in the final formula of average costs

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and determine how much capital is spent for the company today.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The value of the sources taken separately.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
If we take the debt sources as the main priority in modern business,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
then we can talk about the value of the bond and the value of the loan financing.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You probably know how to calculate the value of a loan.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.000
This is the percentage and the corresponding expenses for the loan, divided by the amount of the loan.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
In general, this is how it was explained to you.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
But there is one important remark.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
The loan scheme is well known in the world.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
This is the simplest approach to the percentage payments to the amount of the loan.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
It is not often used in the modern world.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:24.000
For example, a banker is giving out a loan and wants to take some risks.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
What can he do?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
He can leave the amount of the compensation balance at your account.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Usually, this is no more than 15% of the amount of the main debt.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
In this case, the value of the loan is increasing.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
The denominator is not the total amount of the loan,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
but the minus of the compensation balance.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
The denominator decreases, the whole expression of the fraction increases,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
and the value of the loan increases.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000
There are other more severe loans for business and other borrowers.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
For example, a loan to a loan office.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Even buying a car on credit today will most likely be done according to this scheme.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Why is it considered the most applicable for borrowers?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Because the calculation of the debt, despite the fact that the loan was registered for 3 or 5 years,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
the calculation of the debt begins from the very beginning of the registration.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That is, a month or a quarter has passed, and a part of the main debt will have to be paid off in installments.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
If you look closely at the general scheme of this debt,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
then for a company, with a percentage rate of 15% per year,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
this loan will cost almost 30% per year.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That is, the rate is almost doubled.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Because you use less and less loan amount, and the rate remains constant.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
These are the features of the assessment of credit resources.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
As for bonds, when assessing bonds as a source of debt financing,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
it should be borne in mind that there is a current profitability and profitability to repayment.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The current profitability is calculated in the same way as the cost of credit resources.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The investment of the coupon income multiplied by the nominal cost of the bond is divided by its current cost.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
What percentage you get, you get.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
This is the current profitability of the bond.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
But for the borrower company, the total profitability is important.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
That is, the profitability to repayment.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:56.000
If I add the amount that I have to pay at the time of repayment of the bond,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and I have to return the nominal,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
then this total cost will give the profitability to repayment.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
The general formula looks very simple.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
The amount for a period of, say, N years,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:22.000
let it be 5 years, which is a fashionable term of bond loans in Russia today.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Here is the amount and component consisting of 5 years.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000
The coupon income divided by the unit plus the rate of profitability required.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
The denominator is the discount multiplier.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I have specially brought you two tables of discounting in the lecture conspectus,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
so that you can calculate the cost of the debt financing sources yourself.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The second component of the denominator is the discount rate.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Here, keep in mind that the amount required by the norm of profitability

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.000
in economic terms means the lowest profitability limit that suits the investor.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The money owners are ready to give you for investment.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
If we leave the value of R as unknown and solve the equation of R,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
we will get the profitability of repayment.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Today, the built-in functions of Excel allow us to do this very quickly.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000
If I want to calculate this parameter immediately,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
then there is a method of approximate calculations.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The sum of the coupon income,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
plus the denominator minus the current value of the bond,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
divided by the number of years, for example, by 5,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and the denominator is the half-sum of the denominator and the current profitability of the bond.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
What is the error?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Usually, on the second sign, after the comma, that is, 12.24%,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I had doubts in the fourth.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So, for approximate calculations, it is suitable, you can use it.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It is much more difficult to calculate the value of the share.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I believe that at the moment, there is no way in the world of science

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
that gives the opportunity to accurately estimate the value of the share.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Although, several Nobel Prizes have been awarded for this,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
there are no accurate calculations for today.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
What is the problem here?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Any value, including capital, is determined by the future,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:59.000
by some expectations of how much income I will receive from owning this financial instrument.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But the future is always unpredictable, and that's the whole problem.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The problem of the valuation of the share is the problem of taking into account the risk factor.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:14.000
The most popular formula for calculating the value of the share is the Gordon formula.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It is very simple, you just need to understand its economic meaning.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The numerator is D1, that is, the dividend of the first year.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
C0 is the base year, the zero year.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
D1 is the first year.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
The denominator is the required income rate, R, minus the dividend rate.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
What is the value of this formula?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:44.000
For young companies, if the formula includes the dividend rate,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
that is, the company is developing,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.000
then this formula can accurately determine the value of the share of such a company.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
For a traditional company, especially for one that pays dividends unevenly,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
the calculation of this formula is very difficult.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
What is the weakness of this formula?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
It is very difficult to predict the rate of dividend growth.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Of course, we still rely on our forecasts, on the preceding financial data about this company.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And yet, it is impossible to take into account the exact repetition of the situation in the future.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
The future will always be different from the previous period.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And taking into account this discrepancy, this is the main problem for financiers.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
In the West, Sharpe model has received a very wide spread.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Pay attention, the main comparison with ARM is often said.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
This is the Sharpe model, the Nobel Prize in Economics.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:07.000
The profitability of my share of the company is equal to R0.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
If I move R to the right, it is a risk-free rate.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Plus the expression in the right part of the data,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Btg multiplied by Mm, this is the profitability of the market portfolio, minus the risk-free rate.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
This is called the risk-free bonus.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Each share of a particular company is made up of two components.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
The risk-free rate plus the risk-free bonus.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
The main difficulty of using this formula is the determination of the beta coefficient.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It expresses the reaction of a particular share of the company to the change in the market price.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Let's say you trade your shares in the RTS system, the Russian fund platform.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.000
The value of the market portfolio, that is, the total shares that are presented there, is 16%.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Last week, the RTS index went down.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It dropped to 4% immediately.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Look at how the value of your share of the company reacted to the change in the external environment.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It dropped to 8%.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Its reaction is more acute than the reaction of the entire market.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
This means that the beta coefficient is greater than 1.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
If we take such proportions, it is close to 2.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The reaction is more severe to the change of the external environment than the reaction of the market.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
This coefficient in Western practice, where a huge statistical array of data is accumulated,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000
exists an agency that constantly provides data for a huge number of companies.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:15.000
In Russian practice, obtaining this data is difficult, and therefore it is quite difficult to use this formula.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
The simplest way is to use the income approaches.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The second is to take into account the risk factor.
