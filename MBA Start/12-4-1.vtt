00:04.880 --> 00:06.880
Hello, dear colleagues.

00:06.880 --> 00:13.280
Today's part of our video course on operational management

00:13.280 --> 00:16.280
will be conducted by me.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.280
My name is Oleg Levyakov.

00:20.280 --> 00:26.280
Today we will talk about several extremely important issues

00:26.560 --> 00:31.560
that are important for the survival of a company in modern market conditions.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.560
One of these issues is the placement of production and service facilities.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.560
Issues such as where to place a factory or enterprise,

00:49.840 --> 00:56.840
where to place an office or a reception center that provides services to the population,

00:56.840 --> 01:02.840
are becoming the main strategies of both production and service companies,

01:02.840 --> 01:08.840
especially in the modern times of global markets and global production.

01:08.840 --> 01:15.840
The drastic changes in trade relations have turned the world into a global village

01:16.120 --> 01:21.120
and have given companies both large and medium-sized

01:21.120 --> 01:26.120
a greater flexibility in choosing their facilities.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.120
However, the issue of practical placement of enterprises

01:32.120 --> 01:36.120
should be solved taking into account two contradictory conditions.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.120
Please look at the slide.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.120
On the one hand, production must be placed close to the consumers,

01:45.400 --> 01:49.400
which is due to competition for time gain,

01:49.400 --> 01:55.400
as well as various trade agreements and the desire to reduce transport costs.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.400
On the other hand, production must be placed close to a cheap

02:01.400 --> 02:05.400
and at the same time highly qualified workforce.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.400
When placing production and service facilities,

02:12.680 --> 02:15.680
companies must be guided by various criteria,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.680
determined by the requirements of market competition.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.680
Let's briefly comment on these main criteria

02:24.680 --> 02:30.680
that affect the choice of the location of production facilities and other facilities,

02:30.680 --> 02:33.680
both service and logistics.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.680
Please look at the next slide.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.960
These criteria are proximity to the consumer.

02:43.960 --> 02:49.960
On the other hand, a very important criterion is the business climate as a whole.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.960
A business climate favorable for a company can include

02:53.960 --> 02:57.960
a comparable scale of entrepreneurship,

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
the presence of companies operating in the same industry,

03:00.960 --> 03:06.960
in the case of foreign branches, the presence of other foreign companies.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.240
In addition, a business climate is determined by the presence of

03:10.240 --> 03:15.240
a clear and transparent legislation in the business sphere,

03:15.240 --> 03:20.240
the support of entrepreneurial activity by local authorities,

03:20.240 --> 03:26.240
state authorities, subsidies, benefits, and so on.

03:27.240 --> 03:32.240
In total, the last element is determined by the term goodwill,

03:32.240 --> 03:34.240
that is, non-material assets.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.520
The next important criterion is the total costs.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.520
The goal of the optimal location is to choose a place

03:43.520 --> 03:46.520
with the lowest total costs for the company.

03:46.520 --> 03:51.520
In addition to production, they include various regional costs,

03:51.520 --> 03:56.520
internal and external costs for the distribution of goods.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.520
Regional costs include land rental costs,

04:00.800 --> 04:06.800
construction costs, payment of local labor,

04:06.800 --> 04:13.800
local and state taxes, as well as energy and other costs.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.800
There are also hidden costs that are difficult to take into account.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.800
These include costs for transportation to long distances of raw materials.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.080
There are also costs for the transportation of finished products

04:30.080 --> 04:34.080
between various intermediaries up to the end consumer,

04:34.080 --> 04:38.080
which depends on the distribution system used by the company.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.080
It is necessary to consider the weakening of the consumer's response

04:43.080 --> 04:46.080
in the case of a remote location of the consumer market,

04:46.080 --> 04:52.080
which is an extremely important factor in the conditions of the consumer's dictatorship

04:52.080 --> 04:54.080
on almost any market.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.360
The next important criterion is infrastructure.

04:59.360 --> 05:05.360
For any modern enterprise, especially in the field of mass production,

05:05.360 --> 05:09.360
it is necessary to have a well-developed transport system,

05:09.360 --> 05:13.360
including automotive, railway, water, aviation transport,

05:13.360 --> 05:20.360
as well as the provision of electricity needs in telecommunications and communications.

05:20.640 --> 05:28.640
In many countries, the first place is given to the quality of professional training of the workforce.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.640
Educational and professional levels of the workforce should meet the needs of the company,

05:36.640 --> 05:43.640
and even more important is the readiness and ability of the workforce to train and adapt.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.920
The next important criterion is the proximity to suppliers.

05:47.920 --> 05:52.920
The presence of a highly professional and competitive network of suppliers

05:52.920 --> 05:57.920
is one of the determining conditions for the placement of individual units of the enterprise.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.920
The proximity of the main suppliers, among other advantages,

06:02.920 --> 06:06.920
allows the use of methods of organization of the safe production,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.200
the so-called lean production,

06:09.200 --> 06:18.200
or the production of elements in a just-in-time sequence.

06:19.200 --> 06:24.200
It is important to note the role of the location of other companies' facilities,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.200
primarily the management facilities.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.200
The location of factories and distribution centers of the company

06:32.480 --> 06:36.480
can significantly affect the choice of the location of a new facility.

06:36.480 --> 06:42.480
In this context, the decision on the placement is closely related to the choice of assortment

06:42.480 --> 06:45.480
and the volume of produced products for a particular market.

06:46.480 --> 06:55.480
In the conditions of globalization, it is very important to pay attention to the placement of free trade zones.

06:55.760 --> 07:03.760
The so-called free trade zones are usually closed regions

07:03.760 --> 07:07.760
under the supervision of state customs services,

07:07.760 --> 07:11.760
where imported goods of foreign production are sold directly,

07:11.760 --> 07:15.760
without the formalities required by the customs of a particular country.

07:16.760 --> 07:23.760
In free trade zones, producers can easily import imported materials and accessories

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
used in their own production,

07:26.040 --> 07:31.040
and also receive a delay in the payment of customs fees

07:31.040 --> 07:35.040
until the delivery of the produced goods to the consumer country.

07:37.040 --> 07:42.040
In some countries, especially in conditions when the production capacity of many companies

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
is transferred to third world countries,

07:45.040 --> 07:48.040
there is a criteria called political risk.

07:48.320 --> 07:53.320
The rapidly changing geopolitical situation in many countries

07:53.320 --> 07:56.320
opens up new opportunities,

07:57.320 --> 08:02.320
but on the other hand, it determines many conditions of risk management.

08:03.320 --> 08:11.320
No matter how promising the idea of placing some production in Afghanistan may seem,

08:11.600 --> 08:21.600
the political risks are such that any company must measure many times before cutting.

08:22.600 --> 08:31.600
This criterion is closely related to the criterion of the presence or absence of state barriers to protect its market.

08:31.600 --> 08:38.600
At present, in many countries, barriers to the entry into the industry and the placement of production have been legally removed.

08:38.880 --> 08:49.880
However, when planning a placement, many not only official, but also legal and cultural barriers should be taken into account.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.880
That is, the difference, first of all, in the national mentality.

08:53.880 --> 09:00.880
The presence or absence of trade unions in one region or another also plays an important role.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.160
What is a trade union?

09:03.160 --> 09:10.160
This is a group of countries that have concluded agreements on mutual conditions of trade in goods.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.160
Companies that place their enterprises within the countries of a particular trade union

09:15.160 --> 09:22.160
use some additional advantages in new markets and provide lower costs.

09:22.440 --> 09:30.440
Recently, when placing, first of all, harmful products, such as chemical, industrial,

09:30.440 --> 09:34.440
as in many industries, color and black metallurgy,

09:34.440 --> 09:37.440
environmental requirements should be taken into account,

09:37.440 --> 09:44.440
which are issued to the companies that are placed, the government of certain countries or regions.

09:44.720 --> 09:52.720
It is very important to consider the interest of the consumer country in the placement of a foreign enterprise in its territory.

09:52.720 --> 10:00.720
At the same time, the significant importance is not only the will of the leadership of a particular state,

10:00.720 --> 10:09.720
but also the educational level of the local population, its quality of life and its attitude to foreign employees.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
And the last thing to say is the competitive advantage,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
which is extremely important for transnational companies in the matter of choosing a state

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
in which to place a headquarters or a holding company.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
One of the gurus of scientific management, Michael Porter, noted that companies can have

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
different basic foundations for certain types or parts of a business.

10:38.280 --> 10:43.280
However, the competitive advantage is created in the company's headquarters,

10:43.280 --> 10:50.280
where a strategy is determined, the main product is developed, the so-called product design,

10:50.280 --> 10:56.280
where technological processes are developed, process design,

10:56.280 --> 11:00.280
where the main critical mass of production is created.

11:00.280 --> 11:06.280
Therefore, the company should transfer its basic foundation only to the country

11:06.560 --> 11:13.560
which will encourage innovative activity and provide the best conditions for global competitiveness.

11:13.560 --> 11:28.560
Now, dear colleagues, we will consider the methods used to analyze the conditions for the placement of an object in a particular company.

11:28.840 --> 11:35.840
When performing analysis, the rating system factor is used, the linear programming method

11:35.840 --> 11:40.840
and the so-called centroid method or the center of gravity method.

11:40.840 --> 11:50.840
Each of these methods is a technical tool, and it should be used together with the most detailed and detailed analysis of costs.

11:50.840 --> 11:57.840
And, of course, they should all be associated with the business strategy and business planning of the company's activities.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.120
Please look at the following slide.

12:00.120 --> 12:08.120
The rating system factor is the most widely used general method of location selection.

12:08.120 --> 12:15.120
It is built on a mechanism that allows you to combine various factors in an easy-to-understand and understandable form.

12:15.120 --> 12:23.120
For example, for a certain oil-recycling enterprise, the following score scale is determined in points,

12:23.400 --> 12:27.400
the main factors that affect the location selection.

12:28.400 --> 12:36.400
As you can see on the slide, this factor includes the region's infrastructure capabilities,

12:36.400 --> 12:44.400
the availability and reliability of labor resources, living conditions, the availability of transport networks and some other conditions.

12:44.680 --> 12:50.680
This factor is used to determine the appropriate score scales that you are free to choose.

12:50.680 --> 12:58.680
You need to evaluate each factor in points for each possible location option of this plant.

12:58.680 --> 13:09.680
The overall score of the points is determined by the resulting score, which is the so-called rating of the appropriate location option.

13:09.960 --> 13:17.960
The final location of the plant is chosen according to the option with the highest rating, i.e. the highest score.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.960
However, this method has its drawbacks.

13:20.960 --> 13:29.960
The main problem of using simple rating system factors, i.e. those systems that can be used using paper and pencil,

13:29.960 --> 13:36.960
is that they do not take into account the range of ranges and costs that may take place within each factor.

13:37.240 --> 13:43.240
The first factor may have the highest score, but be unuseful for decision-making on location.

13:43.240 --> 13:48.240
The second may, on the contrary, have a small scale, but determine the real value of the site.

13:48.240 --> 13:55.240
To solve this problem, it is proposed to additionally introduce a weighted assessment of the importance of each factor,

13:55.240 --> 14:05.240
based on relative limits of the cost variation, and not just on the total costs for one or another option.

14:05.520 --> 14:11.520
The next technical method is called the transport method of linear programming.

14:11.520 --> 14:20.520
Those of you, dear listeners, who have basic mathematical or technical training, know what it is.

14:20.520 --> 14:26.520
The transport method is a variety of linear programming methods.

14:26.800 --> 14:37.800
It was given this name because it is widely used to solve problems related to the transportation of products from different sources to several possible destination points.

14:37.800 --> 14:42.800
Such tasks usually follow one of two possible goals.

14:43.080 --> 14:51.080
The first goal is to minimize the cost of delivering a certain amount of products to a certain number of destination points,

14:51.080 --> 14:58.080
and to maximize the profit from delivering a certain amount of products to a certain number of destination points.

14:58.080 --> 15:04.080
These are two approaches that define one picture.

15:04.360 --> 15:12.360
If a creative approach is provided, it can be used to solve different types of tasks.

15:12.360 --> 15:20.360
For example, this method can be used to test the cost of different options of location of new objects

15:20.360 --> 15:26.360
in the existing distribution network.

15:26.640 --> 15:41.640
To do this, you need to add a new line to the table, which must contain the costs of transporting one cargo unit from the producing object to some new place.

15:41.640 --> 15:49.640
Then, a solution is calculated for a new matrix, which shows the minimum total costs.

15:49.640 --> 15:54.640
This is another view that will allow you to make the right decision.

15:54.920 --> 16:03.920
The centroid method is used to determine the location of new objects,

16:03.920 --> 16:08.920
primarily logistic objects, namely, warehouse infrastructure.

16:08.920 --> 16:17.920
It allows to determine the location of an object that provides the minimum costs for transporting cargo

16:17.920 --> 16:23.920
and takes into account the location of existing objects in the production or distribution network.

16:24.200 --> 16:29.200
It also calculates the distance between objects and the volume of cargo that needs to be transported.

16:29.200 --> 16:35.200
In a simplified form, this method assumes that all the transport costs in the forward and reverse direction are the same

16:35.200 --> 16:40.200
and does not take into account the losses due to incomplete loading of the transport.

16:40.200 --> 16:45.200
As we can see from the last conditions, it is also not completely objective.

16:45.480 --> 16:53.480
This is just one of several ways to get a general picture of the solution of an important issue.

16:53.480 --> 17:03.480
Dear colleagues, I am not afraid to show myself as a joker, but I must repeat that by choosing the location of your enterprise,

17:03.480 --> 17:14.480
you are making a very serious investment that should provide you with long-term income as a result of your activities in the chosen place.

17:14.760 --> 17:22.760
Therefore, it is necessary to remember that it is quite problematic to change the location you have chosen once.

17:22.760 --> 17:30.760
You end up with a suitcase with a torn handle, which is difficult to throw away and carry.

17:30.760 --> 17:34.760
Therefore, you need to take this issue very seriously.

17:34.760 --> 17:40.760
If you have located your enterprise in a region with a high cost of energy resources,

17:41.040 --> 17:48.040
then even modern strategic management will not justify the advantages you have lost.

17:48.040 --> 18:00.040
It is fair to use labor resources for the strategy, if the employment in the region you have chosen is characterized by a tendency to increase labor payments,

18:00.040 --> 18:08.040
or vice versa, low labor payments, but poor professional training or low labor discipline.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.320
These issues will also need to be solved.

18:11.320 --> 18:18.320
They are considered by a separate scientific direction, which is called organizational modeling.

18:18.320 --> 18:25.320
In addition, it is impossible to forget about non-economic, political factors,

18:25.320 --> 18:37.320
because there are cases when the decision to place an enterprise provided for consideration by local and regional authorities was rejected at the stage of consent.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.600
Or it could cause a storm of protests from the local population.

18:42.600 --> 18:51.600
This is due to additional costs or losses for the company, so they cannot be ignored when making a decision to place an enterprise.

18:52.600 --> 19:02.600
After you choose the most suitable options for you, the time will come when you will need to make a final decision on the location.

19:02.880 --> 19:07.880
To do this, study the situation in the selected regions, analyzing the following factors

19:07.880 --> 19:11.880
1. Consumer purchasing power in the region

19:11.880 --> 19:14.880
2. Compatibility of the image of your company

19:14.880 --> 19:16.880
3. Corporate culture

19:16.880 --> 19:21.880
4. Service level with demographic situation in the region

19:21.880 --> 19:25.880
5. Competition level with local and foreign manufacturers

19:25.880 --> 19:31.880
6. Geographical features of the facilities of your company and the company of competitors

19:32.160 --> 19:35.160
7. Service level of your company's consumers

19:35.160 --> 19:40.160
8. Your competitiveness and your relationship with business partners

19:40.160 --> 19:46.160
In general, you can draw some conclusions and recommendations on the above problems.

19:47.160 --> 19:55.160
Analyze the options for choosing the location of the company at the stage of the technical and economic justification of the business project.

19:55.440 --> 20:01.440
Choose the location of the company based on the location of the raw materials suppliers,

20:01.440 --> 20:06.440
main auxiliary production materials and semi-finished products.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.440
Location of the main consumption centers in relation to the company.

20:12.440 --> 20:19.440
For example, this is a vitally important issue for the manufacturer of fast-growing products.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.720
Consider the infrastructure of the location of the company,

20:22.720 --> 20:25.720
not only from the point of view of the transport network,

20:25.720 --> 20:29.720
but also from the point of view of the financial infrastructure,

20:29.720 --> 20:35.720
which includes banks, insurance, finance, investment companies and other objects.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.720
Evaluate the possibility of replacing materials and consumables in the event that,

20:40.720 --> 20:48.720
when choosing a location, a significant factor is the cost of transporting raw materials from distant regions.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Even if these regions are familiar to you, regions of production.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Determine the costs for production and marketing operations for alternative locations.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
Take your choice so that the costs for the produced product are minimal in total,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
and not in individual areas.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.280
Take into account the socio-economic aspects,

21:13.280 --> 21:18.280
environmental factors, factors of the national culture of the population.

21:19.280 --> 21:24.280
After you have identified several alternative options, analyze them in more detail.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.280
Also evaluate the following data and the financial risks associated with them,

21:29.280 --> 21:32.280
using the Risk Management levers.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.280
Production costs.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
Production costs.

21:36.560 --> 21:41.560
Production costs for marketing operations, both ATL and BTL classes.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.560
Investment costs, including expenses for environmental protection.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
Planned income.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
Tax level in the subsidy-benefit subsidy,

21:52.560 --> 21:57.560
which is determined by local and federal authorities.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.560
Pure flows of real money, the so-called cash flow.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.840
Analyze and evaluate these aspects not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively.

22:07.840 --> 22:13.840
And draw conclusions regarding the feasibility and life-span of the chosen location,

22:13.840 --> 22:16.840
without forgetting about the suitcase with the torn handle.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.840
When choosing the location of the company,

22:20.840 --> 22:25.840
pay attention to how it will affect your flexibility.

22:26.840 --> 22:31.840
Production is based on various conditions that can change over time.

22:32.840 --> 22:39.840
The life cycle of modern business structures, modern goods, has been so reduced

22:39.840 --> 22:44.840
that it makes sense to prefer a location that allows for greater flexibility

22:44.840 --> 22:48.840
in relation to modifications and changes in the activities of your company,

22:48.840 --> 22:52.840
including activities in the field of the production of a particular product.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.840
Do not forget about the experience and capabilities of your employees,

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
especially top managers.

23:02.120 --> 23:07.120
Prefer to place your company in regions where you have personal and business connections.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.120
That is the goodwill.

23:10.120 --> 23:17.120
After we have briefly discussed macro-analyzing the placement of your company's objects,

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
let's talk a little about micro-analyzing.

23:20.120 --> 23:25.120
That is, the placement of individual blocks of your company on a selected site.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.400
You should approach the placement of production units of the company

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
as well as the location of the company itself

23:33.400 --> 23:38.400
from the point of view of obtaining the maximum result from the company's activities.

23:39.400 --> 23:45.400
The placement of units on a selected site should be carried out in stages.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
Approximately in the following order.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.400
1. Placing workshops and other units on the territory of the enterprise.

23:53.680 --> 23:58.680
2. Placing workshops and other units on the territory of the enterprise.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.680
3. Placing workplaces on the territory of the enterprise.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.680
Dear colleagues, please look at the following slide.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.680
The placement of production units of the enterprise should provide

24:09.680 --> 24:13.680
a rational organization of the entire production process.

24:13.680 --> 24:18.680
To do this, the decision to place production units on the territory

24:18.680 --> 24:22.680
must comply with certain rules and principles.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.960
Here are the main ones.

24:24.960 --> 24:29.960
The first condition concerns the placement of workshops on the course of the production process.

24:30.960 --> 24:37.960
It is very important to take into account that the principle of direct accuracy must be ensured.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.960
To ensure this principle, you must place the main workshops

24:41.960 --> 24:45.960
on the territory of the enterprise along the course of the production process

24:45.960 --> 24:50.960
according to the direction of the main internal factory flows.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.240
From the manufacturing workshops and warehouses to the processing workshops,

24:55.240 --> 25:00.240
and from them to the assembly workshops, and from there to the outgoing warehouses.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.240
2. The location of warehouses at the entrance and exit of the enterprise.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.240
The raw materials warehouses should be placed at the entrance of the enterprise

25:10.240 --> 25:13.240
from the side of the access roads for the import of goods,

25:13.240 --> 25:18.240
and the ready-made products warehouses near the assembly workshops at the exit of the enterprise.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.520
3. The location of auxiliary workshops near the consumers.

25:23.520 --> 25:27.520
The auxiliary production units should be placed as close as possible

25:27.520 --> 25:31.520
to the main production units consuming their products,

25:31.520 --> 25:35.520
without violating the main directions of the cargo flows.

25:35.520 --> 25:42.520
4. The placement of production units taking into account the logistical audits.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.800
The main auxiliary production units, warehouses and other units

25:46.800 --> 25:52.800
should be placed in such a way to ensure the shortest path of the material flows,

25:52.800 --> 25:56.800
the shortest run of vehicles during the production process,

25:56.800 --> 26:00.800
avoiding reverse and counter-movement,

26:00.800 --> 26:05.800
excessive crossings and organization of low-loaded routes.

26:06.080 --> 26:14.080
5. The placement of production facilities taking into account the external factors.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.080
Natural, public, technological.

26:17.080 --> 26:23.080
The main auxiliary production units should be placed taking into account

26:23.080 --> 26:28.080
such factors as natural, such as pink winds,

26:28.080 --> 26:32.080
the possibility of natural lighting, natural ventilation,

26:32.360 --> 26:38.360
the compliance of the architectural, construction, sanitary, technical, fire protection and other standards

26:38.360 --> 26:41.360
provided for your enterprise.

26:41.360 --> 26:46.360
6. The possibility of group building of production facilities.

26:46.360 --> 26:51.360
The separate units, which are closely interconnected during the production process,

26:51.360 --> 26:56.360
should be able to be united into clusters, into groups with placement in one building.

26:56.640 --> 27:02.640
7. The possibility of expansion and modification of production structure.

27:02.640 --> 27:07.640
The possibility of flexible change of production programs.

27:07.640 --> 27:12.640
The facilities on the territory of the enterprise should be placed in such a way

27:12.640 --> 27:16.640
to ensure the possibility of their further expansion and reconstruction

27:16.640 --> 27:19.640
with minimal costs, time and resources,

27:19.640 --> 27:24.640
without the need for demolition or demolition of existing facilities,

27:24.920 --> 27:27.920
and without violating the main idea of the general plan.

27:27.920 --> 27:37.920
8. The maximum use of the land area and the volume of buildings and premises.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.920
The facilities on the territory of the enterprise should be placed in such a way

27:41.920 --> 27:46.920
to ensure the maximum use of these introductory indicators.

27:46.920 --> 27:51.920
The first important point is the location of production facilities

27:52.200 --> 27:55.200
on the territory of the enterprise.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.200
To ensure the principle of directness,

27:58.200 --> 28:03.200
you should make every effort to place the main production sites

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
on the territory of the enterprise along the production process

28:06.200 --> 28:12.200
according to the direction of the main flows of materials,

28:12.200 --> 28:16.200
which occur approximately as follows,

28:16.200 --> 28:21.200
from the entrance warehouses through the processing workshops

28:21.480 --> 28:23.480
and further to the assembly production.

28:23.480 --> 28:30.480
The second point is the location of warehouses at the entrance or exit of the enterprise.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.480
The warehouses of raw materials should be placed at the entrance of the enterprise,

28:34.480 --> 28:39.480
and the warehouses of finished products should be placed near the assembly workshops at the entrance of the enterprise.

28:39.480 --> 28:46.480
The next factor is the location of auxiliary production facilities closer to the consumer.

28:46.760 --> 28:53.760
The auxiliary production facilities should be placed as close to the main production units

28:53.760 --> 28:59.760
that consume their products, without violating the main directions of the flows of goods.

28:59.760 --> 29:05.760
Make an effort to place the production sites taking into account the rationality of transportation.

29:05.760 --> 29:12.760
The main auxiliary production units, warehouses and other facilities should be placed

29:13.040 --> 29:16.040
in order to ensure the shortest path of the flow of materials

29:16.040 --> 29:21.040
and the shortest run-time of the factory transport during the production process,

29:21.040 --> 29:25.040
without reverse and counter-movements, without excessive crossings,

29:25.040 --> 29:30.040
and without the organization of low-load, and therefore irrational routes.

29:30.040 --> 29:35.040
It is necessary to take into account the importance of placing the production facilities

29:35.040 --> 29:40.040
taking into account the external factors, both natural and technological and public.

29:40.320 --> 29:46.320
Your main auxiliary production facilities, services and their facilities should be placed

29:46.320 --> 29:50.320
taking into account such factors as pink winds in this region,

29:50.320 --> 29:55.320
as well as the possibility of natural lighting, as well as the possibility of ventilation,

29:55.320 --> 30:03.320
while keeping in mind the established architectural, sanitary-technical, fire-fighting and other standards.

30:03.320 --> 30:08.320
It is necessary to provide a group construction of production structures,

30:08.600 --> 30:13.600
and individual units, which are closely interconnected during the production process,

30:13.600 --> 30:17.600
should be able to join the group with the placement in one building.

30:17.600 --> 30:25.600
When placing your production facilities, it is necessary to take into account the possibility of expansion and modification of the production structure.

30:25.600 --> 30:31.600
The facilities on the territory of the enterprise and its units should be placed in order to ensure

30:31.600 --> 30:37.600
the possibility of their further expansion and reconstruction with minimal costs of time and resources,

30:37.880 --> 30:44.880
without violating the main general idea of the plan and without demolishing the previously built facilities.

30:44.880 --> 30:52.880
It is necessary to remember the need for the maximum use of the area of the land plot, building or premises.

30:52.880 --> 30:58.880
The facilities on the territory of the enterprise and its units should be placed in order to ensure

30:58.880 --> 31:03.880
the maximum use of the area of the land plot, building or premises.

31:04.160 --> 31:10.160
It is necessary to increase the number of floors of the building,

31:10.160 --> 31:16.160
if this does not contradict the technological maps and technological processes.

31:16.160 --> 31:22.160
It is necessary to use the area and space for the passage of the buildings,

31:22.160 --> 31:28.160
the use of suspended, underground, multi-tiered transport lines and storage places rationally.

31:28.440 --> 31:34.440
The efficiency of the use of the area of your land plot is determined by two coefficients.

31:34.440 --> 31:40.440
This is the coefficient of the development of the land plot, which is the ratio of the area of the buildings

31:40.440 --> 31:46.440
and the covered structures to the area of the entire land plot.

31:46.440 --> 31:52.440
Its average value in the industrial expression is approximately 0.22-0.35.

31:52.720 --> 31:58.720
The coefficient of the use of the area of the land plot, which is the ratio of the area of the buildings

31:58.720 --> 32:02.720
and the covered structures to the area of the entire land plot.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.720
Its value usually varies from 0.4 to 0.7.

32:06.720 --> 32:12.720
It is necessary to emphasize that the area of the land plot is adapted to the specific needs of the enterprise.

32:12.720 --> 32:18.720
The area of the land plot is the area of the entire land plot.

32:19.500 --> 32:25.500
It is necessary to emphasize that the area of the land plot is adapted to the specific needs of the enterprise.

32:25.500 --> 32:30.500
All this should not be forgotten, because the results of the wrong choice of production facilities,

32:30.500 --> 32:34.500
their incorrect operation and a lack of understanding of the problems associated with them

32:34.500 --> 32:38.500
will immediately affect the balance of your firm's departments.

32:38.500 --> 32:42.500
Both in terms of expenses and in terms of revenues.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.280
If you find that the building does not meet the new requirements of your business,

32:47.280 --> 32:51.280
do not rush to make a quick decision.

32:51.280 --> 32:57.280
Of course, it is not necessary to build, but an unthinkable decision will result in a limitation

32:57.280 --> 33:01.280
for the further growth of the business and may lead to even greater problems.

33:01.280 --> 33:05.280
Do not give up the desire to find a quick solution to your problems.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.280
This is impossible.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.280
Most likely, your attempts will be ineffective

33:12.060 --> 33:14.060
and will most likely lead to adverse results.

33:14.060 --> 33:22.060
The most important issue when choosing a room for your business is the choice of the so-called shell of the building itself.

33:24.060 --> 33:32.060
The fact is that most civil construction facilities are designed for service life up to 75 years.

33:32.060 --> 33:36.060
Unfortunately, they are not sufficiently modernized.

33:36.840 --> 33:44.840
The shell that best suits your premises depends on both internal and external conditions

33:44.840 --> 33:48.840
and on the environmental factors.

33:48.840 --> 33:54.840
For most firms, this depends on the type of production.

33:54.840 --> 34:02.840
For many manufacturers, the type of the necessary premises depends on the stage of development of your business structure.

34:03.620 --> 34:07.620
Whether they are young, mature, mature.

34:08.620 --> 34:11.620
Please look at the following slide.

34:11.620 --> 34:19.620
This table shows the approximate ratio of the stage of development of the firm,

34:19.620 --> 34:23.620
the type of production premises, the type of property,

34:23.620 --> 34:29.620
the premises that are most suitable for your firm.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.400
What else is necessary when choosing a room?

34:34.400 --> 34:40.400
Most likely, the logic suggests that you need to get answers to the following questions.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
What technology do you use?

34:42.400 --> 34:48.400
What relations between employees should be ensured for effective activity?

34:48.400 --> 34:54.400
These questions will be considered in the next section of our course.

34:55.180 --> 34:59.180
What are the requirements for free space necessary for working with partners?

34:59.180 --> 35:03.180
How quickly does the situation inside our firm change?

35:03.180 --> 35:09.180
How closely does the situation change in terms of external factors of your firm?

35:09.180 --> 35:12.180
How wide are your connections with the outside world?

35:12.180 --> 35:16.180
What is your firm's attitude to its image?

35:16.180 --> 35:20.180
To determine how well-equipped your premises are,

35:20.180 --> 35:24.180
try to answer the following question.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.960
Is your building available for regular cargo deliveries?

35:28.960 --> 35:32.960
Is the internal communication satisfactory?

35:32.960 --> 35:38.960
Does your premises have all the necessary systems and equipment for your business?

35:38.960 --> 35:42.960
These include the water and gas supply system,

35:42.960 --> 35:46.960
heating system, fire extinguishing system,

35:46.960 --> 35:52.960
optical window or cable connection system,

35:53.740 --> 35:55.740
and a number of other systems.

35:55.740 --> 36:01.740
Are the premises large enough to accommodate all the necessary equipment?

36:01.740 --> 36:07.740
Is the building fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and air conditioning?

36:07.740 --> 36:13.740
Is your building well-located in terms of employees and clients?

36:13.740 --> 36:16.740
Can they get to you quickly?

36:17.520 --> 36:21.520
This is especially important in large metropolises,

36:21.520 --> 36:28.520
where both clients and employees have to stand in traffic for hours to get to the right place.

36:28.520 --> 36:33.520
Is there enough space around your building for parking cars?

36:33.520 --> 36:38.520
Is the main structure of the building in good condition?

36:38.520 --> 36:42.520
Does the decoration of the premises satisfy you and your clients?

36:43.300 --> 36:51.300
Does the premises meet the requirements of the fire safety law and sanitary and epidemiological standards?

36:51.300 --> 36:55.300
The more positive answers you give to these questions,

36:55.300 --> 37:01.300
the more you can be sure that the production premises at your disposal

37:01.300 --> 37:05.300
meet your needs in space in the most effective way.

37:05.300 --> 37:09.300
And you won't have to spend a long time

37:10.080 --> 37:14.080
looking for new objects or reconstructions.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.080
Please look at the next slide.

37:17.080 --> 37:22.080
Here are the main conclusions and recommendations.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.080
When choosing a production premises,

37:25.080 --> 37:28.080
take into account the specifics of your business,

37:28.080 --> 37:30.080
what and how you will produce,

37:30.080 --> 37:33.080
your general needs in production areas,

37:33.080 --> 37:37.080
with conditions of possible growth, in conditions of market growth,

37:37.860 --> 37:40.860
the requirements of the building that are specific to your business,

37:40.860 --> 37:43.860
the design features, the width of the doorways,

37:43.860 --> 37:48.860
the height of the ceilings, the load on the floor,

37:48.860 --> 37:55.860
the general requirements of the building, such as the location and infrastructure,

37:55.860 --> 38:00.860
the condition of the building, the terms and conditions of the lease agreements,

38:00.860 --> 38:04.860
the need to obtain additional permits and agreements

38:05.640 --> 38:08.640
for the location of your building.

38:08.640 --> 38:13.640
The compliance of the production premises with the requirements of the electrical and fire safety,

38:13.640 --> 38:17.640
the requirements of the legislation in the field of health and safety of workers.

38:17.640 --> 38:24.640
The cost of the expenses for both devices of your production in this building.

38:24.640 --> 38:28.640
Now, dear colleagues, we will talk about a no less important topic,

38:28.640 --> 38:32.640
about the decisions regarding the choice of production equipment.

38:33.420 --> 38:36.420
Planning and choosing of production equipment,

38:36.420 --> 38:40.420
which means the allocation of very significant money and other resources

38:40.420 --> 38:44.420
for the production, is an extremely important task.

38:45.420 --> 38:48.420
It requires the presentation of the expected demand

38:48.420 --> 38:52.420
in the form of the needs in production capacities and workforce,

38:52.420 --> 38:55.420
due to the obligations to the main suppliers,

38:55.420 --> 38:58.420
taking into account the possibility of demand growth.

38:59.200 --> 39:04.200
All these decisions often have to be made before obtaining real orders.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.200
The degree of intuition in making such decisions

39:08.200 --> 39:11.200
and their justification depends on the business itself.

39:11.200 --> 39:15.200
Nevertheless, there is a certain consistency of measures,

39:15.200 --> 39:18.200
which will allow you to make decisions with greater confidence

39:18.200 --> 39:21.200
and without great analytical efforts.

39:21.980 --> 39:24.980
The forecasting of the general demand

39:24.980 --> 39:28.980
and the specific expected volumes of sales of your products.

39:28.980 --> 39:33.980
The decision on which components to buy and which to produce with your own resources.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.980
One of the most important management dilemmas.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.980
Make or buy.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.980
The design of the production process,

39:41.980 --> 39:45.980
the determination of the real, not overestimated and not underestimated

39:45.980 --> 39:47.980
demand in capital investments.

39:48.760 --> 39:52.760
The development and implementation of technical equipment and the technological process.

39:52.760 --> 39:56.760
What else should you pay attention to when choosing production equipment?

39:56.760 --> 39:59.760
Please look at the following slide.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.760
When choosing a specific equipment,

40:02.760 --> 40:05.760
I recommend that you make a list of key questions.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.760
What products will you produce and in what quantities?

40:09.760 --> 40:15.760
What are the features of the technological process of work of your enterprise?

40:16.540 --> 40:22.540
What factors will determine for you when choosing technological equipment parameters?

40:22.540 --> 40:26.540
What basic and auxiliary equipment do you need?

40:26.540 --> 40:30.540
What equipment is presented on the market and who offers it?

40:30.540 --> 40:34.540
What raw material or components do you need?

40:34.540 --> 40:36.540
What means do you have?

40:36.540 --> 40:40.540
Is it possible to purchase the equipment you have chosen,

40:40.540 --> 40:44.540
for example, on the conditions of leasing or payment delay?

40:45.320 --> 40:49.320
The following slides show specific steps

40:49.320 --> 40:53.320
that make up the equipment selection procedure.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.320
1. Determine the need for machines and equipment

40:58.320 --> 41:02.320
based on the planned production capacity and selected technology.

41:02.320 --> 41:06.320
At the same time, we recommend paying special attention to the performance

41:06.320 --> 41:10.320
and planned operating mode, so-called equipment loading.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.320
If your equipment will work with a low load,

41:15.100 --> 41:19.100
it will be a sign of its wrong choice.

41:19.100 --> 41:23.100
This situation often occurs when choosing lift-transport equipment,

41:23.100 --> 41:27.100
for example, in a warehouse.

41:27.100 --> 41:31.100
Although the weight of a separate pallet rarely exceeds 1 ton,

41:31.100 --> 41:35.100
fork-loaders with a load capacity of 3-5 tons are very often used.

41:35.100 --> 41:39.100
This is at least irrational.

41:39.100 --> 41:43.100
2. Based on the planned operating mode,

41:43.880 --> 41:47.880
determine the nominal required capacity of the equipment

41:47.880 --> 41:51.880
and compare it with the required capacity in other production areas,

41:51.880 --> 41:55.880
so that there are no narrow places.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.880
The issue of adjusting problems with narrow places

41:59.880 --> 42:03.880
will be discussed in detail in the last part of our course.

42:05.880 --> 42:09.880
3. The need for machines and equipment should be related

42:10.660 --> 42:14.660
to the capacity requirements at various stages of the technological process.

42:14.660 --> 42:18.660
This is the axiom.

42:18.660 --> 42:22.660
4. Make an approximate list of the basic and auxiliary equipment you need.

42:22.660 --> 42:26.660
Start selecting equipment from those machines

42:26.660 --> 42:30.660
that play a fundamental role in your technological process,

42:30.660 --> 42:34.660
gradually moving from basic equipment to auxiliary equipment.

42:34.660 --> 42:38.660
5. Your technical department, with the participation of the top management,

42:39.440 --> 42:43.440
should constantly analyze offers on the equipment market,

42:43.440 --> 42:47.440
contact catalogs of manufacturers, participate in exhibitions,

42:47.440 --> 42:51.440
in order to get an idea of possible options in advance

42:51.440 --> 42:55.440
in terms of performance, cost, completeness,

42:55.440 --> 42:59.440
delivery conditions, installation, installation, warranty service,

42:59.440 --> 43:03.440
and other pre-transaction, transaction and post-transaction conditions.

43:04.220 --> 43:08.220
6. When choosing equipment, pay attention to other characteristics,

43:08.220 --> 43:12.220
for example, its weight and dimensions,

43:12.220 --> 43:16.220
which is especially important if your production is located

43:16.220 --> 43:20.220
in a multi-storey building, the amount of raw materials used,

43:20.220 --> 43:24.220
electricity, service complexity, equipment complexity

43:24.220 --> 43:28.220
in relation to the qualifications of workers, and other very important indicators.

43:28.220 --> 43:32.220
7. Think in advance where and how the equipment will be installed,

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
find out from manufacturers what additional costs

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
related to the operation of a particular type of equipment

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
may arise at your enterprise.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
This can be the installation of special ventilation devices,

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
air conditioning devices, power cables,

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
technological water supply and discharge, special measures

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
for fire and electrical safety, and so on.

44:01.780 --> 44:05.780
8. The total cost of ownership.

44:05.780 --> 44:09.780
Provide the budget for the purchase of equipment

44:09.780 --> 44:13.780
not less than 10%, but better 15% of the total cost

44:13.780 --> 44:17.780
for additional expenses, including the installation of the equipment,

44:17.780 --> 44:21.780
the purchase of spare parts, equipment, materials,

44:21.780 --> 44:25.780
control and measurement instruments, and so on.

44:25.780 --> 44:29.780
9. You can see the conclusions and recommendations on the next slide.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.560
The conclusions on the equipment selection are as follows.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.560
Equipment should be selected only after the production process

44:38.560 --> 44:42.560
is designed. You must decide what components

44:42.560 --> 44:46.560
you will buy and what you will produce with your own resources.

44:46.560 --> 44:50.560
You must determine the real needs in capital investments.

44:50.560 --> 44:54.560
You must base the choice of equipment on the forecasts of the total demand

44:54.560 --> 44:58.560
and the expected sales volumes, that is, on the data

44:59.340 --> 45:01.340
of the marketing analysis.

45:01.340 --> 45:05.340
The decision to install production facilities is a key element

45:05.340 --> 45:09.340
in the overall strategic planning of any company.

45:09.340 --> 45:13.340
The drastic changes in the global environment,

45:13.340 --> 45:17.340
in combination with the rapid development of technology and equipment,

45:17.340 --> 45:21.340
have led to the fact that it takes very little time

45:21.340 --> 45:25.340
for the managers to make a decision on the installation of equipment.

45:26.120 --> 45:30.120
It was not until recently, but only for weeks, and sometimes for days.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.120
In addition, many of these decisions concern not the installation of factories

45:34.120 --> 45:38.120
or retail items, but supporting functions.

45:38.120 --> 45:42.120
If you remember, one of our initial activities

45:42.120 --> 45:46.120
in the modern economy is the service sector.

45:46.120 --> 45:50.120
This is one of the manifestations of this effect.

45:50.900 --> 45:54.900
A few words about the features of the installation of service facilities.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.900
First of all, it should be noted that due to the great variety of service services

45:58.900 --> 46:02.900
and relatively low costs for creating service companies compared to industrial ones,

46:02.900 --> 46:06.900
new service centers are introduced much more often than new factories and warehouses.

46:06.900 --> 46:10.900
In the service sector, it is very important to have many points of contact

46:10.900 --> 46:14.900
with the customer, and this is a key element.

46:14.900 --> 46:18.900
The service sector is a very important part of the global economy.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.680
It is very important to have many points of contact with the customer.

46:23.680 --> 46:27.680
Therefore, the decision to install service facilities is closely related

46:27.680 --> 46:31.680
to the decision to choose a market,

46:31.680 --> 46:35.680
to the decision on how close the service facility is to the consumer.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.680
If the decision to install new industrial enterprises is made

46:41.680 --> 46:45.680
primarily on the basis of the decision on the minimum total costs,

46:46.460 --> 46:50.460
then many methods for deciding on the installation of service facilities

46:50.460 --> 46:54.460
are based on maximizing potential profits in various places.

46:54.460 --> 46:58.460
This is the main fundamental difference.

46:59.240 --> 47:03.240
The main fundamental difference.

47:15.240 --> 47:19.240
To manage means to lead enterprises to the goal.

47:19.240 --> 47:23.240
This phrase by Andrei Foyoli from his book

47:23.240 --> 47:27.240
What is Production? is very well known.

47:28.020 --> 47:32.020
Now we will talk about the most important part of the management

47:32.020 --> 47:36.020
of a production and service enterprise.

47:36.020 --> 47:40.020
The so-called loading of production and service facilities.

47:40.020 --> 47:44.020
In other words, the placement of processes.

47:44.020 --> 47:48.020
Look at the next slide.

47:48.020 --> 47:52.020
Let's talk about what production is.

47:52.020 --> 47:56.020
It is necessary to remember that the production process includes

47:56.800 --> 48:00.800
more than just the production of a certain material product.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.800
Production always represents not only a product,

48:04.800 --> 48:08.800
but also a service to consumers.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.800
The process of processing means adding value

48:12.800 --> 48:16.800
or advantage to what is processed.

48:16.800 --> 48:20.800
It should be remembered that people, machines are a resource

48:20.800 --> 48:24.800
and a base for production.

48:25.580 --> 48:29.580
Pay attention to the following slide,

48:29.580 --> 48:33.580
where the answers to the questionnaire are indicated.

48:33.580 --> 48:37.580
What do you understand about production?

48:37.580 --> 48:41.580
Production is a process of processing or transformation.

48:41.580 --> 48:45.580
Production is intended for the production of goods or products.

48:45.580 --> 48:49.580
Production involves the presence of professional knowledge and skills.

48:49.580 --> 48:53.580
It requires a complex combination of knowledge and skills.

48:54.360 --> 48:58.360
It is the main task of management.

48:58.360 --> 49:02.360
It is responsible for most of the selection of personnel.

49:02.360 --> 49:06.360
It is the main area for huge investments in business.

49:06.360 --> 49:10.360
It is the main means of satisfying consumer requirements.

49:10.360 --> 49:14.360
It is the main factor that often decides the profitability and growth.

49:14.360 --> 49:18.360
This list is not exhaustive,

49:18.360 --> 49:22.360
but the statement of the main task of management

49:23.140 --> 49:27.140
is typical and typical of any type of business.

49:31.140 --> 49:35.140
Using the usual resource-product model,

49:35.140 --> 49:39.140
production can be defined as a process of processing,

49:39.140 --> 49:43.140
in which the resource is added to the cost of the product

49:43.140 --> 49:47.140
to the desired consumer.

49:47.140 --> 49:51.140
Perhaps this is a simplified definition,

49:51.920 --> 49:55.920
but it gives a practical understanding of the essence of production.

49:55.920 --> 49:59.920
In the next slide, you will be able to refresh your memory

49:59.920 --> 50:03.920
of the production process scheme.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.920
One of the main aspects of production is the transformation of resources,

50:07.920 --> 50:11.920
which acquire enterprises, goods,

50:11.920 --> 50:15.920
which are then supposed to be successfully sold to consumers.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.920
This assumes that your customers consider your goods more valuable

50:20.700 --> 50:24.700
than the competitors.

50:24.700 --> 50:28.700
Therefore, the process of processing is considered

50:28.700 --> 50:32.700
as a process of adding value.

50:32.700 --> 50:36.700
According to this picture,

50:36.700 --> 50:40.700
the task of the enterprise is to perceive the factors of production

50:40.700 --> 50:44.700
at the input, process them, and then give the finished product.

50:44.700 --> 50:48.700
This is called production activity.

50:49.480 --> 50:53.480
The first three categories are the source resources,

50:53.480 --> 50:57.480
which should be purchased so that the production process functions.

50:57.480 --> 51:01.480
These are orders received from customers.

51:01.480 --> 51:05.480
It is the work of marketologists

51:05.480 --> 51:09.480
aimed at increasing the number of these orders

51:09.480 --> 51:13.480
that is the driving force of any business process,

51:13.480 --> 51:17.480
including production.

51:18.260 --> 51:22.260
This is an unexpected word for the economy.

51:22.260 --> 51:26.260
But otherwise, as a view of the future,

51:26.260 --> 51:30.260
this phenomenon is not called.

51:30.260 --> 51:34.260
Expectations can be considered an inexhaustible source,

51:34.260 --> 51:38.260
an immaterial resource, formed from a number of sources.

51:38.260 --> 51:42.260
The fact is that each manager of a business process

51:42.260 --> 51:46.260
puts together his opinion on production,

51:47.040 --> 51:51.040
and the consumer expects that it will be more useful for him

51:51.040 --> 51:55.040
than the one that competes with him on the market.

51:55.040 --> 51:59.040
Production activity consists of many elements

51:59.040 --> 52:03.040
that are interconnected

52:03.040 --> 52:07.040
within the framework of what is called the supply chain.

52:07.040 --> 52:11.040
Accordingly, production is a part of a larger,

52:11.040 --> 52:15.040
complex business system.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.820
Accordingly, production as a subsystem requires qualified management.

52:19.820 --> 52:23.820
Production, from the point of view of management,

52:23.820 --> 52:27.820
is a complex of decisions that require

52:27.820 --> 52:31.820
careful forecasting and planning.

52:31.820 --> 52:35.820
Initial decisions usually concern less technical issues,

52:35.820 --> 52:39.820
but more organizational and marketing ones.

52:39.820 --> 52:43.820
You should decide how to use your time and resources,

52:44.600 --> 52:48.600
and what volume of work you are ready to take on.

52:48.600 --> 52:52.600
To make the right decision, you need to know

52:52.600 --> 52:56.600
what work you can do better than your competitors.

52:56.600 --> 53:00.600
That is, you need to determine your core function.

53:00.600 --> 53:04.600
The finished product of a production business

53:04.600 --> 53:08.600
is always a certain product, including a service.

53:08.600 --> 53:12.600
A service is a product that adds value

53:13.380 --> 53:17.380
to the main material product produced by the consumer.

53:17.380 --> 53:21.380
Please look at the next slide.

53:21.380 --> 53:25.380
It contains certain recommendations

53:25.380 --> 53:29.380
that you can use when making a decision

53:29.380 --> 53:33.380
on the placement and development of production.

53:33.380 --> 53:37.380
The main task of production is to process resources

53:37.380 --> 53:41.380
into a finished product that is more valuable to the consumer

53:42.160 --> 53:46.160
otherwise your entire activity will be pointless.

53:46.160 --> 53:50.160
The main resources include people, energy, raw materials, machines,

53:50.160 --> 53:54.160
and what is called 5P operational management.

53:56.160 --> 54:00.160
In every business, the process of processing

54:00.160 --> 54:04.160
takes place according to its technology

54:04.160 --> 54:08.160
and you need to understand how production functions

54:08.940 --> 54:12.940
The most important factor of success

54:12.940 --> 54:16.940
is whether you can find specialists

54:16.940 --> 54:20.940
who can provide the basis for operations, control,

54:20.940 --> 54:24.940
and the complete process of processing.

54:24.940 --> 54:28.940
This issue has been very hotly debated

54:28.940 --> 54:32.940
all over the world, including in our country.

54:32.940 --> 54:36.940
What types of production are there?

54:37.720 --> 54:41.720
This is a complex characteristic of the technical,

54:41.720 --> 54:45.720
organizational, and economic features of production

54:45.720 --> 54:49.720
due to its specialization in volume and constant nomenclature.

54:49.720 --> 54:53.720
If volume is used as a key factor

54:53.720 --> 54:57.720
in determining the variety of type processes,

54:57.720 --> 55:01.720
then you can identify 5 types of production.

55:01.720 --> 55:05.720
This is design production.

55:06.500 --> 55:10.500
The production equipment is transported to the place where the product is produced.

55:10.500 --> 55:14.500
What is the example? Construction.

55:14.500 --> 55:18.500
The next type is the production of products by order.

55:18.500 --> 55:22.500
Sometimes it is also called small-scale production.

55:22.500 --> 55:26.500
It is determined by the fact that the production of one product

55:26.500 --> 55:30.500
is carried out for a specific client.

55:30.500 --> 55:34.500
The manufacturer adjusts his equipment

55:35.280 --> 55:39.280
to the requirements of the client.

55:39.280 --> 55:43.280
For example, the production system

55:43.280 --> 55:47.280
at the engine companies is designed for machines

55:47.280 --> 55:51.280
with extremely high technical characteristics.

55:51.280 --> 55:55.280
Another example is the diamond-diamond complex.

55:55.280 --> 55:59.280
Each specific limited precious stone

55:59.280 --> 56:03.280
is produced at the request of a jewelry trading company.

56:04.060 --> 56:08.060
This allows you to perform a wide range of orders

56:08.060 --> 56:12.060
within the framework of this qualification

56:12.060 --> 56:16.060
and be competitive in everything except price.

56:16.060 --> 56:20.060
The price here expresses a high-quality characteristic

56:20.060 --> 56:24.060
than affects the order.

56:24.060 --> 56:28.060
The client is ready to pay for the value that he needs.

56:28.060 --> 56:32.060
It should be noted that the production of products by order

56:32.840 --> 56:36.840
is carried out at once.

56:36.840 --> 56:40.840
Each product has a set of individual properties.

56:40.840 --> 56:44.840
It does not matter if the diamond is Koh-I-Noor

56:44.840 --> 56:48.840
or a turbine for a nuclear power plant.

56:48.840 --> 56:52.840
The manufacturer works either according to the client's drawing

56:52.840 --> 56:56.840
or taking into account his wishes

56:56.840 --> 57:00.840
within the framework of so-called joint engineering.

57:01.620 --> 57:05.620
The production is flexible.

57:05.620 --> 57:09.620
This type is characterized by high intensity

57:09.620 --> 57:13.620
and highly qualified work.

57:13.620 --> 57:17.620
It should be noted that re-orders

57:17.620 --> 57:21.620
for this type of production are rare.

57:21.620 --> 57:25.620
It is impossible to take advantage of the re-operation.

57:25.620 --> 57:29.620
The so-called curve of experience is used.

57:30.400 --> 57:34.400
The number of re-orders is less than in the previous type.

57:36.400 --> 57:40.400
The next type of production is determined

57:40.400 --> 57:44.400
as the production of products in batches.

57:44.400 --> 57:48.400
The product obtained as a result of this production

57:48.400 --> 57:52.400
is repetitive with relatively large volumes.

57:52.400 --> 57:56.400
The production is divided into separate operations,

57:57.180 --> 58:01.180
which are used for the next operation

58:01.180 --> 58:05.180
and so on for the final production stage.

58:07.180 --> 58:11.180
The production of products in batches is carried out

58:11.180 --> 58:15.180
when the volume of production is required

58:15.180 --> 58:19.180
and the operation can be repeated.

58:19.180 --> 58:23.180
The distribution of production volumes is large enough

58:23.960 --> 58:27.960
to accommodate several exclusive items,

58:27.960 --> 58:31.960
such as clothes, portes, and many other items.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.960
Such manufacturers usually use universal equipment

58:35.960 --> 58:39.960
that is adapted for equal and effective execution

58:39.960 --> 58:43.960
of repetitive operations,

58:43.960 --> 58:47.960
because small volumes of production

58:47.960 --> 58:51.960
do not justify capital investment in specialized equipment.

58:52.740 --> 58:56.740
The volume of the product increases even more.

58:56.740 --> 59:00.740
The quality step in increasing the volume.

59:00.740 --> 59:04.740
The need to introduce a special process appears,

59:04.740 --> 59:08.740
which is carried out in each stage of production in sequence.

59:08.740 --> 59:12.740
The distribution of production is used

59:12.740 --> 59:16.740
when the upcoming increase in volumes

59:16.740 --> 59:20.740
justifies capital investment in production

59:21.520 --> 59:25.520
of a particular type of product.

59:25.520 --> 59:29.520
All production is organized in this type

59:29.520 --> 59:33.520
as a sequence of operations,

59:33.520 --> 59:37.520
the so-called streams,

59:37.520 --> 59:41.520
necessary for the production of a given assortment of products,

59:41.520 --> 59:45.520
for which a production line is intended.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.520
The characteristic of stream production

59:50.300 --> 59:54.300
is continuous production,

59:54.300 --> 59:58.300
which takes place in a number of industries.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300
This process is characteristic, for example,

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.300
for oil chemical processes,

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:10.300
for coxochemical batteries, for purification facilities, and so on.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.300
It should be borne in mind that each type of production process

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.300
has a distinctive property.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.080
The following four factors are necessary for the production process.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.080
1. Productivity and customer needs.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.080
2. Production process. 3. Capital investment and cost.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.080
4. Organizational infrastructure. 5. Adequate market requirements.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.080
What is the most important element for a company

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.080
that produces products at order?

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.080
Of course, the exact fulfillment of the consumer's requirements.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.860
This is the most important element.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.860
When producing batches of products,

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.860
it is possible to perform different volumes of work.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.860
This type of production is a connecting link

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.860
between the option of performing small orders

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.860
and the wide-scale production of standardized products.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.860
When producing batches of products,

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.640
companies with exact production offer

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.640
clearly limited standardized products,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.640
which are produced in large batches and compete in price.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.640
The modern level of production business

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.640
knows the examples of mega-factories,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.640
one or two of which can meet the needs

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.640
of the population of the entire globe

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.420
and the demand for a particular product.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.420
An example is the production of printers

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.420
by Rengxerox. There are only two of them.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.420
The production level of Rengxerox

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:05.420
is from 40 to 45 percent.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.420
When producing products at order,

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:13.420
the high degree of flexibility of production

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.200
is the effective implementation of the main resource

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.200
of the workers' qualifications.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.200
This type of production is characteristic

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.200
for some countries, including Italy.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.200
It should be noted that when producing products

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.200
at order, the capital investment in equipment is relatively low.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.200
A small number of specialists are usually used.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.980
This leads to relatively low capital costs.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:50.980
Given the high intensity of labor and the workers' qualifications,

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.980
the cost of labor is most of all expenses,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.980
up to 70-75 percent.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.980
In some cases, the cost of materials is relatively low

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.980
compared to the cost of labor.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.980
If expensive materials are required,

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.760
the company of diamond-diamond complex

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.760
is a good example.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.760
It produces diamond with a certain number of facets

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.760
and raw stones, which are mainly provided to customers.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760
When producing products at order,

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.760
the capital investment in production

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.540
is the effective implementation of the main resource

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.540
of the workers' qualifications.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.540
The company tries to use equipment as much as possible

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.540
by producing more hours of production

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.540
using the same technology.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:02.540
This increases the efficiency of the capital investment.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:06.540
The highest level of capital investment

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.320
is the material acquired from other companies.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.320
The cost of labor is a relatively small part of the costs.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.320
Dear listeners, in the course of the workbook

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.320
you will be able to find a consideration

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.320
of some other aspects of the choice of type of production,

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.320
including how the type of production

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.100
affects the organizational structure.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.100
In the workbook, in my opinion,

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.100
there is a fairly interesting table

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.100
that compares different aspects of production processes

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:54.100
and the consequences that are characteristic

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.100
of each of the types of production.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.100
From the table, it is clear that the options of production

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.880
are the most important and strategic impact

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.880
on many aspects of the business.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.880
Now look at the next slide,

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.880
which shows some conclusions and recommendations

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.880
that would be useful for you

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.880
when choosing the type of production.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.880
In general, when choosing the type of production

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.660
you need to clearly distinguish the main types of production.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.660
They cannot be mixed, because they are managed in completely different ways.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:43.660
You must understand the hidden disadvantages

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.660
and advantages of each type of production.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.660
Determine the most acceptable type of production for you,

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:55.660
as well as anticipate organizational and other changes,

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.660
including changes in the field of corporate culture,

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:04.440
and then make a choice of a specific type of production.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.440
Now, dear listeners, we will discuss the following topic,

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.440
namely, what is a production cycle.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.440
A production cycle is a period of time

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.440
during which all stages of the production process

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.440
pass, from the first production operation

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.440
to the delivery of the finished product to the consumer.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:33.220
This period is divided into two parts.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.220
The working period, during which the work is in the process of production,

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.220
and the time of breaks in this process.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:45.220
The working period is the time of technological and non-technological operations.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:49.220
The last number is all control and transport operations,

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.220
as well as operations for re-arrangement

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.220
from the moment of the first production operation

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
to the moment of the delivery of the finished product.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Business practice shows that the reduction of the production cycle

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
allows enterprises to accelerate the turnover of their funds,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
to implement the established plan with minimal costs,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and to produce a part of the turnover.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
This is very important, especially for small enterprises.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
The experience of successful enterprises shows that

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.780
the reduction of the production cycle

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.780
is one of the most important tasks of a modern organization,

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.780
which is the sole solution that largely depends on the effective

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.780
and profitable work of the entire system as a whole.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.780
Please look at the following slide.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.780
It shows the principles of the organization of production,

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.780
which are currently relevant for an effective and competitive organization.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560
These principles are as follows.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560
Proportionality, parallelism, continuity,

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.560
accuracy, rhythm, flexibility and complexity.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.560
Proportionality in the organization of production

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.560
is the corresponding productivity of all units of the enterprise to each other.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.560
To ensure maximum proportionality,

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.560
it is necessary to design the enterprise correctly

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.560
and optimally combine production sites.

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:28.340
This is almost impossible to achieve in perfect synchrony.

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:32.340
We will talk about this at the end of our course,

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.340
when we will discuss the theory of limitations.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.340
It should be noted that at the current pace of production updates,

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.340
it is necessary to constantly monitor the maintenance

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.340
of the maximum possible proportionality of production.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.340
Because the rearmament of one unit

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.120
or some kind of focus improvements in their activities

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.120
require corresponding changes in the performance and power

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.120
of other units.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.120
To do this, you need to develop tasks for each production site

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.120
taking into account the maximum use of the capabilities of the entire production flow.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.120
In parallel with production,

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.900
the main processes of production are carried out in parallel.

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.900
Parallelity is realized at all levels of the organization.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.900
Parallel execution of the main processes can be realized,

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.900
for example, by processing parts at the same time

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.900
in the assembly-assembly work, so-called network graphics work.

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.900
Parallel execution of the main and auxiliary operations

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.900
can be achieved by combining the time of machine processing,

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.680
the time of installation and removal of parts,

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.680
the time of checking and measuring, loading and unloading of equipment, and so on.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.680
The complication of production at the present time,

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.680
as well as the use of automated,

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.680
and in some cases robotic equipment,

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.680
increases the number of parallel processes.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.680
In the conditions of the complex process of manufacturing of modern products,

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.460
the work of the factory is provided by the acceleration of the turnover of the means.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.460
At the workplace, it is achieved by reducing the time of the auxiliary,

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:29.460
so-called interoperational breaks,

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.460
during the execution of each operation.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.460
At the site and in the production workshop,

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.460
it is done by transferring the semi-finished products from one workplace to another.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.460
Interoperational breaks.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.240
Under the directness of the organization of the production process,

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.240
it is understood that the shortest path of the product passing through all stages of operations

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.240
corresponding to the production process is provided.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.240
From the launch of the production of raw materials and raw materials,

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.240
to the release of the finished product.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.240
In accordance with these requirements, for example,

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.240
the mutual location of buildings and structures on the territory of the enterprise,

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.020
the production process must be carried out in a short time.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.020
Material flow.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.020
To ensure the full use of equipment,

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:31.020
material resources and working time,

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.020
the achievement of rhythm is of great importance.

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.020
The principle of rhythm is assumed by the uniform release of products

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.020
and the rhythmic course of the production process.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.800
The rhythmic release of products means the production of the same amount of products

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.800
in an equal period of time, the so-called monotony of production.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.800
The rhythm of production is expressed in the repetition of production processes

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.800
through equal periods of time and the execution of the same amount of work

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.800
at each workplace.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.800
Why is this indicator important?

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.800
First of all, to determine the minimum possible number of adjustment and rearrangement works,

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.580
which are complex and require high qualification of workers and managers,

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:20.580
without adding to the cost of the final product.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.580
With rhythmic work of production,

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.580
the maximum load of equipment is ensured,

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:32.580
normal operation is improved

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.580
by using material and energy resources and working time.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.580
Unrhythmic work of each section leads to a violation of the normal course of production.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.360
The very important value of determining methods of rhythm

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.360
of production is given to the theory of limitation

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.360
by Ilya Houdra, which we will discuss further.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.360
In addition to all this, the modern level of scientific and technical progress

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.360
requires compliance with the flexibility of the production organization.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.360
Not so long ago, the principles of the production organization

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.360
were achieved by the fact that the production of a certain number of products

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:14.140
should be stable and stable.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.140
The production should be stable and the equipment should be of a certain type,

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:22.140
which sometimes did not change for decades.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.140
In modern conditions, the reduction of the life cycle of any product

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.140
and the rapid renewal of the product should change the technology of production.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.140
Meanwhile, a rapid change in equipment would cause

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.140
unjustified high costs for the manufacturer.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.920
The main advantage of the production organization is the flexibility

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.920
of the equipment, which means the rapid re-establishment of the equipment

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.920
for new, sometimes very relatively related to the previous activity of production operations.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.920
One of the most important principles of the organization

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.920
is also the complexity of production.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.920
Modern production processes are characterized by constant interaction

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.700
and integration of the main auxiliary processes.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.700
Therefore, due to the significant lag of automation of the auxiliary production

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.700
compared to the equipment of the main,

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.700
it is necessary to focus your attention on the rational organization of execution

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.700
not only of the main, but also of the auxiliary,

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.700
providing the auxiliary processes of production.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.700
Although they do not directly bring profits to the enterprise,

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.480
the most organized functioning is impossible

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.480
effective work of the enterprise.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.480
It should also be noted that in addition to types,

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.480
production differs in three main methods of organization of production processes.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.480
Consistent, parallel and so-called parallel-consistent.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.480
With a consistent method, a part in the production process

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.480
goes to each subsequent operation only after the end of processing

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.260
of all parts of the given batch for the previous operation.

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:13.260
In this case, from operation to operation,

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.260
the entire batch of parts is transported at the same time.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:21.260
At the same time, each part lies on each operation,

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.260
first in the waiting of its turn of processing,

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:29.260
then in the waiting of the completion of processing of all parts of this batch.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:33.260
What are the features inherent in the parallel method of production?

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:39.260
With a parallel method of processing of each part

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:43.260
for each subsequent operation,

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:47.260
it begins immediately after the completion of the previous operation,

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.260
regardless of whether the processing of other parts

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:55.260
for the same operation is completed or not.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:59.260
With this method, several units of the same batch

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:03.260
can be simultaneously processed for different operations.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.040
In comparison with the same processes performed in sequence.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.040
This is the significant advantage of the parallel method,

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.040
which allows to reduce the duration of the production process.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.040
We have already discussed the benefits of this reduction.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.040
The third method, parallel-consistent,

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.040
is characterized by the fact that the processing process of parts of a given batch

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.040
for each subsequent operation begins earlier

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:36.820
than that of the previous operation.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:40.820
The parts are thus transferred from one operation to another

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.820
by parts of the total batch.

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.820
The accumulation of some amount of parts on previous operations

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:52.820
before the start of the batch processing on subsequent operations,

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:56.820
the so-called production delay,

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.820
avoids the occurrence of lags.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.600
This is the advantage of parallel-consistent methods.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.600
Based on the above information,

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.600
we can formulate two main goals of production management.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.600
The first is to satisfy the consumer demand.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.600
This is a huge topic, which is devoted to marketing,

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.600
logistics, production management,

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.380
as well as the effective processing of resources.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.380
Not always modern, especially innovative companies

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.380
give enough space in their strategy

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:46.380
to the second part of the effective processing of resources.

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.380
Many organizations have suffered a crash on the market,

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:54.380
despite the presence of quite satisfactory indicators,

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.380
satisfied buyers,

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.160
but they have not been able to rationalize the use of resources.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.160
There are different approaches and methods

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.160
for optimizing the use of raw materials,

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.160
equipment and labor at different types of enterprises.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.160
However, in all cases,

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.160
the goal of production management is to achieve a balanced and economical use of resources.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.160
Its solution is extremely difficult.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.940
It optimizes the use of one resource

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.940
by going to a certain exit to another.

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.940
This is the so-called triple constraint theory.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.940
There is a certain contradiction between these goals.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.940
There are two goals of production management.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.940
Maximization of the output of the production process

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.720
and the satisfaction of the goal create a conflict between them.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.720
Often, the improvement of one goal leads to the improvement of another.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.720
All management management decisions should be made

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.720
based on the presence of conflicting goals,

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.720
the awareness of their conflict,

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.720
and the need to achieve a balance between them at all times.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.720
The task is also complicated by the fact that each of these goals

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.500
has its own conflict situation between the ways of its achievement.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.500
It should be added that the complexity of the management mission

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.500
also determines the variety of strategic functions of management,

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.500
which include the whole product strategy,

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.500
which determines the choice of new products

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.500
and the modernization of the already produced ones,

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.500
the process strategy,

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.280
which determines the choice of ways of production of goods

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:02.280
and the justification of production capacity,

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:06.280
the geographical strategy of the placement of new products in other regions,

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.280
the production organization strategy,

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.280
which determines the organizational structure of the enterprise,

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:18.280
the choice of forms and methods of organization of work within the enterprise structure,

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:22.280
the construction of work sites, the provision of their resources,

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:27.060
the service strategy of production,

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.060
which determines the form of organization of the technical, logistical, warehouse,

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.060
transport and other services of the enterprise,

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.060
the quality strategy,

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:43.060
which is responsible for the so-called total quality management.

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:49.060
The task is closely related to the above-mentioned tasks and problems,

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.840
the issue of placement of the process and the loading of capacities.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.840
The purpose of the placement is to find such a mutual arrangement of objects,

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.840
which will ensure the unhindered movement of the production flow

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.840
to the enterprise or the continuous process of service

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.840
of the consumer in the service organizations.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.840
In any case, when making a decision on the optimal placement,

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:20.620
it is necessary to consider a set of initial parcels,

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.620
specific goals, corresponding to specific criteria of assessment,

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.620
which must be achieved in the placement project,

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:32.620
demand for products and services produced and considered by the system,

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:36.620
the needs of the process in terms of the number of operations,

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.620
and in terms of the volume of material flows,

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:44.620
spatial requirements for the placement of elements in the premises,

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.400
and availability within the building, if a new building,

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.400
then, if possible, its configuration.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.400
Please look at the following slide.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.400
It indicates the reasons for the need to make a decision

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:05.400
on the placement of capacities and planning of premises in the current production.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.400
This can be both inefficiency of the existing process,

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.400
then this operation takes place within the framework of the existing process,

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:18.180
and the process is not in the framework of re-engineering of business processes

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:22.180
or anti-crisis management.

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:26.180
The unfortunate cases of production or increased risk of people's activities

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:30.180
in production, modification of products and services produced under the influence of the market,

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:34.180
the beginning of production of new products and services under the influence of the market,

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.180
changes in the volume of the assortment,

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:42.180
qualitatively, threshold changes,

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.960
or maintenance of scientific and technical progress,

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.960
changes that are caused by environmental or legislative requirements.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.960
Dear listeners, please look at the following slide.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.960
How for existing DACs and for newly opened enterprises,

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:02.960
the aggregate of the event,

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.960
which is called technological preparation of production, is necessary.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.960
Since it is it that helps to master production

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:15.740
and production of new high-quality products in the set time period,

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.740
with a set amount, with high economic efficiency.

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:23.740
Technological preparation of production is a kind of aggregate of the event,

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.740
which ensures the presence of complete conflicts

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.740
of design, technological, control documentation,

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.740
technological equipment, which is necessary for the production of a set volume of the product,

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.740
of the established quality.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.520
The technological preparation of production of new products

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.520
solves the task of ensuring the technological design of your products,

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.520
that is, the ability to manufacture the most acceptable

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.520
in terms of the cost of raw materials,

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.520
working time, method.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.520
Development of technological processes and methods of their control.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.520
Design and manufacture of technological equipment

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.300
and non-standard equipment, if necessary.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.300
Organization and management of the processes of technological preparation of production.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.300
If you are facing this task for the first time,

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:25.300
we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the general rules of ensuring the technological design of the product.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.300
These are standardized rules.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:33.300
They are contained in the Russian GOST No. 14.201-83.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.300
More details on this issue

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.080
are also considered in the applicable workbook.

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.080
Please take a look if you are interested in this.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.080
It should also be noted that the development, acceptance and transfer

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.080
of new technological processes in production is carried out in accordance

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.080
with the requirements of the international standards of the ISO 9000 series.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.080
The management of technological processes in our country

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.080
is carried out in accordance with the SISDINA system of technological preparation of production,

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.860
which is established by the state standard GOST No. 14.001-73.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.860
Now, please take a look at the following slide.

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.860
What should we consider when making a decision

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:28.860
on the optimal placement of equipment?

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.860
First of all, the specific goals of your enterprise

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.640
that are used to assess the project.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.640
The size of the production areas,

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.640
the distance that must be overcome between the various production elements

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.640
and many other things that we have already discussed.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.640
The second most important thing is the demand for the product and services.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.640
The third is the requirement for the process,

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.640
taking into account the number of operations and the volume of the material flow

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.420
between the individual elements in the layout scheme.

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.420
It is also necessary to take into account the spatial requirements

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.420
for the placement of the elements of the premises

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:18.420
and the spatial availability within the structure itself

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:22.420
or, if it is a new structure, then possible architectural planning forms.

01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.420
Please take a look at the following slide.

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.420
It shows the basic methods of placing processes.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.200
There are three basic methods of placing processes and workplaces.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.200
One is based on the technological principle,

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.200
the subject principle, and the principle of service of a mobile object.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.200
And there is also a combined method,

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.200
based on the principle of group technology or the formation of technological cells.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.200
The following slides show the features of the placement of equipment on these principles.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.200
The placement of equipment on the technological principle

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.980
involves the same equipment or homogeneous technological operations,

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.980
which are grouped together.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.980
At the same time, the processed part is moved in accordance with the sequence of operations

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.980
from one place to another, and for each operation the appropriate equipment is located.

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:21.980
Under the optimal placement in this case,

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.980
such a location of the sites is adopted,

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.760
and the number of moving objects of labor between adjacent sites is determined.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.760
That is, with the minimum possible in-production movements.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.760
The placement of the process according to the technological principle

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.760
is also sometimes called the placement according to the functional principle

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.760
or the placement of a small-scale serial process.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.760
The placement of production that works according to orders.

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.540
The following slide.

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:59.540
Here are the advantages of equipment placement according to the technological principle.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:03.540
First of all, the system meets the most diverse production requirements.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:07.540
The system that is organized in this way

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:11.540
is not particularly sensitive to the failure of individual equipment sections.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:17.540
Equipment is used for general purposes,

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:21.540
and it is usually less expensive than specialized equipment.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.320
At the same time, individual systems of motivation are used

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.320
in the field of management of the workforce.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.320
However, there is never an advantage without a disadvantage.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.320
And you can see the following.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.320
The costs of creating and maintaining material production stocks

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.320
at a certain level can be quite high.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.100
Planning the movement of labor and materials along this system,

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.100
as well as the composition of production schedules,

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.100
is a very difficult mathematical task.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.100
The coefficient of use of equipment of general purpose is not high.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:07.100
The work on the placement of the product is slow and not efficient enough.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:13.100
The relative complexity of the work often reduces the possibility of control

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:17.100
and leads to large costs of control.

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:23.100
The cost of production units is quite high.

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:33.100
At the same time, it is more difficult to manage the production stocks,

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:37.100
the system of purchases, accounting.

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:41.100
The following slides show the features of the placement of the process

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:45.100
according to the subject principle.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:49.880
The following slide shows the placement of the process

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.880
according to the subject principle.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.880
This is the way of placing the process,

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.880
in which the equipment or production process is built

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.880
in the sequence of technological operations,

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.880
through which the product is made.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.880
Most often, in this way of placement,

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.660
the production line for the production of shoes,

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:22.660
chemical plants,

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.660
and even the usual car washing operations are used.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.660
All measures of placement of the process

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.660
and organization of work according to the subject principle

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.660
will be mentioned a little later.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.440
The advantages of the placement of the process

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:49.440
are high productivity, low cost of production units,

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.440
high level of specialization of labor resources,

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.440
which allows fast training,

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.440
low cost of moving the product to the unit,

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:05.440
high level of efficiency of using labor,

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.440
and standardization of all or most processes.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:15.440
The following slide shows the disadvantages of the placement of equipment

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.440
according to the subject principle.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.440
First of all, monotonous work operations give little opportunity for improvement.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.440
This can lead to certain problems

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.440
in the collective's moral climate.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.440
Since in this type of placement,

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:39.440
equipment can be used by unqualified labor,

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:44.220
which can be of little interest to the operation of equipment

01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:48.220
in a proper way and to the quality of the product.

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:52.220
The system is not flexible enough.

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:56.220
The system is extremely sensitive to breakdowns and failures at any stage.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:00.220
Significant costs are required for preventive operations

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.220
and repair of equipment,

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:08.220
as well as maintenance of the reserve of spare parts at a very high level.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The placement of the process according to the principle of group technology

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
or cellular placement, formation of technological cells,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
as this method is sometimes called,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
involves a certain grouping of various equipment

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
in the so-called technological cells,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
in which the full production of products

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
with the same or similar methods and requirements for production is carried out.

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:41.780
However, it should be noted that it can be used

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.780
in small-scale production more effectively.

01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:51.780
Group technology also requires

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:55.780
that technological classification is carried out for all components of the product,

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.780
providing easy identification of each element,

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:03.780
and, accordingly, a suitable encoding system is used,

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.560
allowing to easily and quickly select technological cells

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.560
and equipment necessary for the production of the appropriate product.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.560
Another principle of equipment placement

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.560
is the principle of maintenance of a mobile object.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.560
It is implemented in those exceptional cases,

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.560
when the product, due to large dimensions or mass,

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.560
remains in one place during the entire production process.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:37.340
The most vivid example can be given as a shipbuilding ship.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.340
Some construction facilities,

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:45.340
and even such production activities are far from the main production,

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:49.340
as a film production process.

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:53.340
At the same time, it should be said that many production facilities

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.340
are a combination of various types of equipment placement

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:01.340
and organization of the process.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.120
At the same time, there are quite serious computer tools

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.120
that facilitate the solution of these tasks.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.120
Among the computer programs designed for the search

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:22.120
for the optimal way of placing the process,

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.120
the most widely used is the comparative method

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:30.120
of computer placement of production facilities.

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:34.900
This method is called computerized relative location of facilities technique.

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.900
You can read more about this method in our workbook.

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:45.900
At the same time, it should be said that when solving certain tasks

01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:49.900
related to the organization of production,

01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.900
it is often impossible to get a sufficient number of descriptions of the flow of parts,

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.900
or it is difficult to identify some quality factors

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.680
that interfere with the decision-making of the placement.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.680
In such situations, you can try to use the long-experienced method,

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.680
which is called the systematic layout planning method.

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.680
This method includes the development of a matrix of mutual connections,

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.680
and the general methodology is also provided in our workbook.

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:28.460
This method can be used with both computer technology

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:32.460
and a pencil and a piece of paper.

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.460
Please look at the next slide.

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:41.460
Here is one of the tools of the organization of production,

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.460
which is called the flow line.

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:50.460
The flow line is a kind of a set of processing elements,

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.240
which work at a certain pace and time standard for each technological operation.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.240
The flow line is often a set of products,

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.240
and serves as an example of the organization of the production process oriented on the product.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.240
Usually, the term flow line implies a multiple repeating process,

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.240
which has separate links,

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:21.020
for example, a device for transporting materials.

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:27.020
Flow lines work at a certain pace,

01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:31.020
quite intensively, but at the same time,

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.020
they are available for all operations.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.020
At the same time, the time standards of each technological operation are the same.

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.020
Some flow lines are just a device for transporting materials,

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.800
while others are distinguished by a special configuration of the flow line.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.800
This is a conveyor of U-shaped form,

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.800
rectilinear, winding or other types.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.800
At the same time, the organization of production by the method of the flow line

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.800
implies a very significant and complex operation,

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.800
which is called balancing the flow line.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.580
Despite the fact that the calendar planning,

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:19.580
the most important production plan,

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.580
has a primary role in the management of processes,

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.580
often when the production sites are placed,

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:31.580
it is necessary to balance the flow line.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.580
The need for balancing occurs when the size or number of workplaces

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.580
on the flow line needs to be changed.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.360
For various reasons, including a lack of workforce.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.360
In the most general case, the assembly line is a moving conveyor,

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.360
the work items on which pass through a number of workplaces.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.360
At each workplace, a certain technological operation is performed on the product.

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.360
The operation performed at each workplace consists of separate elements of the task.

01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:07.140
These are the so-called working units.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.140
Usually, working units consist of actions and movements,

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:17.140
which are difficult to subdivide into smaller units.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:21.140
The task of balancing the assembly line is to establish such cycles

01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:25.140
at all workplaces,

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:29.140
so that each worker performs as many elements and tasks,

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.920
as possible during the entire assembly line cycle.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:39.920
And so that the free time not occupied by the operation,

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.920
that is, the so-called downtime, was minimal at all workplaces.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.920
In the following slides, you will see the algorithm of balancing the flow line.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.920
It should be noted that purely empirically,

01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:00.700
it can be concluded that the longest element or task

01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.700
limits the shortest time of the assembly line cycle.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:10.700
This is a kind of bottleneck.

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.700
How to expand these bottlenecks, we will see a little later.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.700
But one of the technological techniques is the splitting of work tasks.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.480
Since the time of performing the longest task

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.480
becomes the lowest time limit,

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.480
it is necessary to split the task into two or more parts.

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.480
This can be achieved using task splitting methods,

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.480
using parallel workplaces,

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.480
using the labor of more qualified workers,

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:56.260
or even come to the redesign of the product.

01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.260
All these methods are considered in the following slide.

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.260
When balancing the assembly line,

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:10.260
there is a problem with the joint performance of the elements of the operation with different lengths.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:14.260
The technical solution to such problems is achieved

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:18.260
by the application of flexible and so-called U-shaped assembly line configurations.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.040
The U-shaped assembly line has several advantages,

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.040
which include the ability to reduce the time for loading and unloading work,

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.040
due to the fact that the places of the input and output of the finished product

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:37.040
are in the territorial vicinity.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.040
This line takes up less space, requires fewer staff,

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.040
and makes it easier for the team to work.

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:49.820
It is worth mentioning the method of balancing the assembly line

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.820
with the mixed sequence of product models.

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:57.820
This method is used by many industrial companies,

01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:01.820
which have introduced the Just-in-Time system,

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:05.820
in particular, the founder of this system is Toyota.

01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:09.820
The purpose of such balancing is to satisfy the changing demand

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:13.820
for various product models and prevent the formation of large stocks.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.600
We can quote Mr. Yoshihiro Mandon from Toyota Motor,

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.600
which draws attention to the simplicity of this approach.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.600
Toyota Motor's assembly line is a mixed sequence of models.

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:36.600
The daily production is calculated by the division of the number of cars

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.600
provided by the monthly production schedule

01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:45.380
and the number of working days per month.

01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:49.380
The order of the assembly of each model is calculated

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.380
and the sequence of their production is determined.

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:57.380
In order for the different models of cars to be produced in the set time,

01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:01.380
the order of their production is set on the assembly line.

01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.380
In fact, very few have succeeded in this.

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:09.380
In the next slide, dear listeners,

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.160
we will discuss the implementation of equipment

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.160
according to the principle of group technology.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.160
This principle unites the two previous ones.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.160
The principle has certain advantages.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.160
First of all, the factor of human relationships is improved

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.160
by using the brigade form of labor.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.160
This brigade form of labor contributes to the rapid acquisition

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.160
and accumulation of production experience.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.160
This principle contributes to the reduction of unfinished production

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:42.940
and the cost of transporting factory materials.

01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.940
It allows you to quickly re-install equipment.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:50.940
When the process is placed according to the principle of group technology

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:54.940
or the formation of so-called technological cells,

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:58.940
various equipment is grouped in cells, clusters,

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:02.940
to perform operations with several products

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:06.940
that are homogeneous in terms of design and technological principles.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.720
Currently, this principle is widely used in various types of metalworking,

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.720
in the production of chips for computer equipment,

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.720
and in a number of other assembly works.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.720
The biggest advantage and benefit from the placement of the process

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.720
according to the principle of cell formation is produced

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.720
by order and small-scale production.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:36.500
The next slide shows the formation procedure of production cells,

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:40.500
which involves the grouping of components of a product

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:44.500
into certain families, which have a general stage of processing,

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:48.500
the determination of the structure of the dominant flow of family components,

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:52.500
on the basis of which technological processes are placed

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:56.500
or re-placed, and the physical grouping of equipment

01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:00.500
and technological percentages in these components.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.280
According to the work of the famous manager and economist Schoenberger,

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.280
the organization of technological cells is the most expedient,

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.280
since it is possible to group a family of components of a product.

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.280
To avoid such a situation when there are several machines of each type,

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:21.280
therefore, the removal of any excess machine from the cell

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.280
is not a good idea.

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:29.280
The main advantage of the organization of technological cells

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:34.060
is that the size of their machine was critical.

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:38.060
When forming in a cell, such problems do not reduce

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:42.060
the throughput of this cell.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:46.060
The work centers consist of easily movable and separate machines,

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:50.060
or of heavy machines, but quite simply fixed on the floor,

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.060
to change their configuration space.

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:58.060
In the following slides,

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.840
the features of the placement of equipment

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.840
in the principle of maintenance of a mobile object are shown.

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.840
To organize the production of a mobile object,

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.840
it is necessary to establish the order of work,

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.840
which is determined by the production stages.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.840
The placement of equipment and components around a mobile object

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.840
should be developed according to the principle of grouping materials

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:31.620
This principle is used when installing such large-scale equipment

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:35.620
as stamping presses for metallurgical production.

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:39.620
For the installation of work,

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:43.620
a series of operations is carried out in strict sequence.

01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:47.620
This principle is applied when assembling products,

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.620
when it begins from the very base of the product,

01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.620
and then components are added to it in the form of standard blocks.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.400
This is the principle of the installation of the famous Elf Tower in the middle of the 19th century.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.400
Dear colleagues, the rest of the material

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.400
will be devoted to the features of the placement of the premises of the service organization,

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.400
the planning of these premises.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.400
It should be noted that the purpose of the placement of the premises of the service organization

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.400
is retail, shops, banks, restaurants, hospitals.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:24.400
Maximization of the number of employees

01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:29.180
and the net profit is obtained from one square meter of the occupied area.

01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:33.180
The placement of objects is closely related

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:37.180
to the management activity called merchandising.

01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:41.180
In addition to the concept of merchandising,

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:45.180
that is, the orientation of the processes

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:49.180
for the organization of the placement of service objects,

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:53.180
the management of the organization of the placement of services

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.960
is based on the increase in the level of sales.

01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.960
When placing service objects,

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.960
the term of the service landscape is actively used,

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.960
the so-called service escape,

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.960
under which the physical environment is understood, where services are provided.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.960
It affects the consumer and the staff.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.960
Understanding the concept of the service landscape

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:26.740
is the basis for choosing a successful placement of premises of a service company.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:30.740
This concept contains three elements,

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:34.740
which must be considered separately.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.740
The environment, spatial and functional placement of goods,

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.740
external attributes.

01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:46.740
The concept of the environment includes such basic characteristics

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.740
as temperature, the presence of music in a restaurant,

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.520
the smell of the restaurant,

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.520
which can affect the work and moral state of not only the workers,

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.520
but, first of all, the perception of the service by the customers.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.520
Despite the fact that many of these characteristics

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.520
initially depend on the design of the premises,

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.520
for example, on the placement of lighting devices,

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.520
ventilation fans, sound-proofing plates,

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.300
for example, near the cooking area there is usually a smell of cooking dishes,

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.300
the lighting of the tables, vestibules, is dim,

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:32.300
the tables near the stage will be noisy in the evening,

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:36.300
and the tables located near the entrance will often be on the through-wall.

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.300
Accordingly, the layout of the store or service object

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:44.300
is an important element of merchandising,

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:48.300
which represents the process of trading

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.080
as an important means of communication.

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.080
The layout of the store is one of the main elements of merchandising.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.080
When developing it, it is important to think of methods

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.080
that stimulate the promotion of buyers to the shopping mall,

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.080
so that they buy more goods than previously planned.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.080
Promoting events are as follows,

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.080
external variety of placement of shopping equipment,

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:21.860
originality of floor pattern, wallpaper,

01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:25.860
inclined transitions, information display,

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:29.860
windshields, lighting, sound background,

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.860
aromatic background, which is quite actively used

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:37.860
in perfume network stores.

01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.860
The atmosphere of the store or service object

01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:45.860
must correspond primarily to its image and general strategy,

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.640
and design must contribute to the favorable decision-making.

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.640
First of all, in order to achieve merchandising,

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.640
it is necessary to select a target buyer

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.640
and develop a concept of a store that meets his needs.

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.640
It is clear that target groups of 15 and 70-year-olds

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.640
are extremely rare to coincide in their preferences.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.640
Accordingly, in order to ensure that both clients

01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:19.420
and buyers are satisfied with the product,

01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:23.420
it is almost impossible to choose only one.

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:27.420
Specialists in retail trading believe that a store is a theater.

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:31.420
The wall and floor represent a scene.

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.420
Lighting, inlays, visual means of communication,

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:39.420
such as displays, are decorations.

01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:43.420
And who plays the role of actors?

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.200
The toy section in this store is the largest.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.200
It is located in the center of the hall on the first floor.

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:56.200
There are several entrances.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.200
In the center of the hall there is a free children's carousel.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.200
On the slides, in the shelves, in the baskets, on the floor,

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.200
there are many toys from different countries.

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:12.200
Each toy can be touched by a small potential buyer.

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:16.980
Children play, Baba Yaga flies under the ceiling.

01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:20.980
Children's melodies sound in the hall.

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:24.980
The atmosphere of such a children's holiday is dominant here.

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:28.980
You know from your experience,

01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:32.980
you need to be a very decisive parent

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:36.980
to come with a child to this store

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:40.980
and be able to take him away from the first floor without buying a toy.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:45.760
Shop fitting.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.760
The store means a complex approach

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:55.760
to the organization of a retail business.

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:59.760
It includes the definition of the store concept,

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.760
the definition of the target audience,

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.760
positioning of the store,

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:12.540
and additional events that stimulate sales.

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:16.540
Our workbook contains material

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:20.540
that concerns, first of all,

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:24.540
the spatial and functional methods of placing goods,

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:28.540
which implies planning the path and movement of the client

01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:32.540
to the group of goods along this path.

01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.540
The purpose of the planned path of movement is to find such a route

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:41.320
and allow to place necessary services along this route

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.320
in order to be desirable for the client.

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:49.320
One of the pioneers of this approach

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.320
was the American Leonard Steeve,

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:57.320
who developed the routes of movement in Kmart stores

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:01.320
so that the buyer did not even have an intention to turn away from it.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:05.320
The dim light in Kmart supermarkets is also famous in this regard.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:10.100
Leonard Steeve planned his stores

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:14.100
in such a way that the buyer moved along the shopping stream.

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:18.100
Special points, placing shops throughout the entire shopping area,

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:22.100
are used to attract the attention of the buyer

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.100
and show them the way to certain sections of the store,

01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:30.100
to certain advantages of the most profitable goods.

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:35.100
It is necessary to focus on several basic elements

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.880
that stem from marketing research

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:43.880
regarding the planning of the route and grouping of goods.

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:47.880
A buyer in a supermarket, when shopping,

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.880
is prone to move around the perimeter.

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:55.880
The appropriate placement of high-profit goods along the walls of the store

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:59.880
increases the likelihood of their purchase.

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.880
The goods located in the supermarket at the end of the aisle

01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:08.660
and other non-business departments

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:12.660
that the buyer expects to be serviced

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:16.660
should be placed on the upper floors or in the dead zones.

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.660
Depending on the system of installation of shopping equipment,

01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:24.660
various types of technological planning of the shopping hall are used.

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:28.660
Linear, so-called lattice, boxing, track or loop,

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.660
mixed, free, exhibition.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.440
These planning solutions are considered in the following slides.

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:45.440
I would ask you to watch them together with the study of the material in the workbook.

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:51.440
For each planning is a planning of a specific store,

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.440
starting with the well-known GUM on Red Square,

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:59.440
ending with the Ram Store on Shremetyevskaya Street.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:04.220
Using the example of the installation of these very profitable

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:08.220
shopping enterprises, you can choose some templates

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:12.220
or templates for the organization of the shopping areas

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:16.220
of your shopping or service enterprises.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.220
What are the services and shopping areas?

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:11.220
When planning service and shopping areas,

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:15.220
attention is extremely important to external attributes,

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:19.220
which include signs, symbols and moving advertising,

01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:23.220
some socially significant elements of the service.

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:27.220
As a surrounding environment,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
these elements are determined by the design of knowledge,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
although the orientation, location and size of many objects and zones

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
can make a certain sense.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
In our workbook, dear listeners,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000
you will also be able to consider some materials

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
describing the complex of measures

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
that ensure the effectiveness of work in the field of management.

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:58.780
For example, the location of the office,

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:02.780
the location of workplaces in the office and the organization of workplaces.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:06.780
It may seem surprising to some of you,

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:10.780
but literally up to a centimeter the necessary spaces

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:14.780
on the work table are calculated,

01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:18.780
the location of pens, notebooks, displays,

01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:22.780
dictaphones and other architectural equipment is indicated.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.560
I hope that the materials in the workbook

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.560
will help you optimize the working areas of your employees,

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.560
while reducing the costs of buying unnecessary equipment.

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:43.560
In general, it should be said that there are only two concepts

01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.560
of the device and planning of service premises,

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.560
used in the practice of organization design.

01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:56.340
This is the office system of planning

01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:00.340
and the hall system,

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:04.340
which is sometimes called the open space system.

01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.340
At the same time, the office system involves the placement of groups of employees

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:14.340
in the divisions and their managers in separate rooms.

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:18.340
The hall principle of the service premises

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.120
is that it is a large hall,

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.120
which often occupies one floor and is designed for up to a thousand people.

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.120
Naturally, such a hall is equipped with air conditioning,

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.120
sound insulation and lighting.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:41.120
It can be allocated using special moving partitions,

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.120
separate areas, as well as places for meetings and receptions of visitors.

01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:49.900
The service premises are considered rational

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:53.900
so that the managers are placed in one room with the subordinates.

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:57.900
Sometimes their workplaces are separated from the subordinates

01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:01.900
by moving partitions.

01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:05.900
The placement of workplaces in halls is made strictly

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:09.900
in accordance with the working process and the flow of documents.

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:13.900
Their grouping is determined by the technology of the main works performed,

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.680
and the number of workplaces can be easily rebuilt.

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:22.680
The cost of building such premises and the required area for one employee

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:26.680
sharply decreases compared to the office method.

01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:30.680
It should also be noted that the administrative offices of the company

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.680
are often designed and built in such a way

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:38.680
as to create the desired image of the company.

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.680
For example, the administrative office complex of the Scandinavian Airline System

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:47.460
is located near Stockholm.

01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:51.460
It is a group of two-story buildings with glass walls

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:55.460
that, according to the designers,

01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:59.460
implies openness of relations and a flat hierarchy,

01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:03.460
that is, a small number of levels of management,

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:07.460
which is a characteristic feature of this company.

02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:11.460
In the following slides, dear listeners,

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.240
you will see a set of signs of successful placement

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:20.240
of production and office operations.

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:24.240
Pay attention to some of these signs.

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.240
This is a straight line structure of the flow,

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.240
no matter if it is of buyers, documents, materials.

02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.240
This is the minimum return time to the starting position.

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.240
This is the predictability of the time of production or purchase.

02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:45.020
This is a small intermediate supply of materials.

02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:49.020
This is, by the way, the epoch in the store.

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:53.020
These are open factory workshops or open office and trading rooms,

02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.020
which allows everyone to see what is happening inside.

02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:01.020
This is narrow places control.

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.020
This is a close location of narrow places to the basic processes.

02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:09.020
This is a clearly organized transportation and storage of materials,

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.800
or visitors.

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.800
This is the absence of unnecessary, overlapping, duplicating,

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.800
moving of materials, documents, visitors.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:23.800
This is an easy adaptation to changing conditions.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:27.800
In addition, considering that service services

02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:31.800
should be face to face with the consumer,

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:35.800
the signs of such a successful layout

02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:40.580
are the structure of the service flow.

02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.580
Finding a room to wait,

02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:48.580
if the buyers are served in order of turn.

02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:52.580
This is the convenience of communication with the client.

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.580
This is the simplicity of monitoring the behavior of the client.

02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:00.580
This is a free entrance and exit with the appropriate means of control,

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.580
including control over the so-called radio frequency tags.

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.360
The departments and their work are organized in such a way

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.360
that the clients see only what you want them to see.

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.360
In particular, if there are rush hours,

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.360
the queue will see the employees of your office,

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.360
who are not directly engaged in servicing their needs.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.360
This will irritate the client.

02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.140
It is also required to provide a uniform distribution of rooms

02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.140
for waiting for the service,

02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:42.140
a minimum of visitors and a minimum of moving of materials,

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.140
and the inability of any kind of disorder.

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:50.140
All this should ensure the main goal of high sales volume

02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:54.140
and a high level of service.

02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:58.140
The main goal of the service is to provide a minimum of visitors

02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:00.920
and a high level of service.
