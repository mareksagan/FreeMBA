00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.850
All business operations

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.750
are documented in accordance

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.310
with the current legislation.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.590
This documentation is accepted

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.050
by the accountants of the company and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.610
is reflected in the accounting.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.570
The diversity of existing

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.650
documents can be grouped by certain

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.810
characteristics.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.830
The documents may

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.030
be compulsory,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.030
comptable and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.470
justifiable.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.450
An example of the ordering documents is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.910
the order of the head or the organization

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.630
contract, let us say, the delivery

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.130
contract.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.290
Combined documents are payment and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.870
calculation information when calculating

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.450
with staff.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.110
Accounting documents

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.450
are such as accounting

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.330
certificates.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.250
Justification documents are

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.730
the receipt of goods.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.450
At the time of drafting, documents

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.150
can be primary, can be summary.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.850
Primary documents, which are drawn

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.170
up initially, say, the payment order

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.970
of the organization, the summary, the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.690
register of documents, all the payment

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.730
orders for one day of the organization.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.330
Documents are divided into one-

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.170
time and cumulative information.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.170
Documents at the place of drafting

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530
are external and internal.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.610
For example, an external bill from a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.750
supplier, an internal document is an income

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.510
order of the organization itself.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.450
The documents can look

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.050
like table, questionnaire

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.970
and combined.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.510
It is better when the design and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.550
processing of primary documents by

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.290
managers takes place in close contact

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.910
with accounting.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.370
This will avoid unnecessary mistakes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.330
in the processing of documents.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.190
In any organization it is necessary

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.330
to identify those who are

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.210
directly related to the processing

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.090
of primary documentation and to train

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.550
them to correctly process them.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.250
The term of storage of primary

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.310
documents is legally fixed

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.530
in Russia for at least five

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.150
years.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390
The responsibility for storage

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.610
and correct filling is not the accountant,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.350
but the manager.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.980
All business operations must

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.880
be accompanied by justifiable documents.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.280
These documents serve as primary

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.640
accounting documents, on the basis

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.080
of which accounting is kept.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.660
Internal documents

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.820
are included.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.780
These are the requirements of the arrival

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.500
order, orders, external documents, accounts, bills.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.980
The documents can be

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.900
multilateral, such as a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.620
trilateral treaty, a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.120
multilateral act.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.200
For each business, a specific

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680
document must be drawn up.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.300
For example, I would like to draw your attention

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.180
to a summary table of different situations.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.900
Suppose the main assets are reflected

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.040
as a contribution to the authorized capital.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.880
What documents will be needed for this?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.460
This requires statutory documents.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.260
The main funds received

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.420
from the founders.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.560
The transfer is made on the basis of the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.580
drawing up of the act of reception of the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.660
transfer of the principal funds.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.440
The process of acquiring the main

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.480
assets also consists of

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.200
several stages.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.180
A sales contract is signed and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.060
an invoice is issued.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.660
The listed legal entities for the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.180
main funds the organization pays.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.860
There will be a statement from the account

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.900
and a payment order of the organization.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.600
To receive the basic funds, a

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.480
goods and transportation bill is

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.060
issued and accompanied by a invoice.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480
The main funds of accounting

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.500
are taken on balance sheet.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.180
This document is drawn up as an act of acceptance

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.280
of the transfer of the principal funds.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.020
The main funds are transferred to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.240
the current long-term lease.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.920
For this purpose, a lease contract

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960
is drawn up and a payment invoice is issued.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.880
To record the transfer of the principal assets

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.080
to the lease recipient, an act of acceptance

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.220
of the transfer of the principal assets

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.800
is drawn up.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.080
The moment of receipt of the rent is

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.520
recorded by a statement from the account

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.340
of the organization.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.660
This is an example of documentation

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.420
of certain operations.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.560
The justification documents

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.860
in the organization confirm the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.300
fact of the economic transaction.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.420
Examples of justifiable documents

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.560
can be income and expenditure

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.620
bills, various acts, cash

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.520
checks and other documents.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.680
Accounting documents

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.560
are usually handled

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.680
by accounting staff.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.280
These documents do not contain facts

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.300
that confirm the commission of

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.860
economic transactions.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.440
These are the accountant's calculations,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.920
these are the accountant's certificates,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.380
which are prepared in the accounting

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.080
office and serve as the basis for further

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.940
accounting records.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.960
Accounting registers are documents

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.720
of analytical and synthetic accounting,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.600
records, journals, archives, accounting

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.280
books, but they are not the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.920
subject of our consideration

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.760
in this course.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.900
Combined documents contain the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.980
signs of both orders and justificative

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.580
documents.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.660
Suppose the charge requirement for the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.340
release of materials from the warehouses

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.860
of production, the cargo and transportation

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.320
charge, the calculation and payment

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.020
notice for the issuance of

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.140
wages and so on.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.040
I will try to explain what the

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.180
combination of this document consists of.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.700
Take a calculation and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.020
payment note for payroll.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.120
The first function that performs

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.880
the document is the

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.180
accounting document.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.320
The accountant shall make this report

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.540
for persons receiving wages.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.940
It calculates wages and

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.040
determines the amount

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.860
to be paid.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.840
The function of this document is regulatory.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.560
After the payment report was transferred

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.200
to the cash office, it serves

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.580
as the basis for the issuance

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.360
of salary to each employee.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.380
And after the salary is issued, the signatures

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.480
of all employees are received

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.380
that they received the money, this

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.500
is an excuse document for the

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.260
cashier, that the money from

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.060
the cash he issued.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.060
Primary documents are drawn up at

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.620
the time of the economic transactions.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.400
Documents for receipt and release

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.340
of materials, payroll calculation,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.900
shipment of products,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.440
cash orders, payment

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.120
orders and so on.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.660
Summary documents are the first

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.380
stage of the generalization of

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.360
information, which is contained

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.040
in several primary documents that

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.600
precede their accounting processing.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.020
Let us say that these are commodity reports

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.380
of the person responsible for the matter, or

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.020
the cash reports of the cashier, or

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.320
reports of the person responsible

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.640
for the expenditure of the cash advance.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.940
Thus, the data of primary documents

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.220
are summarized by the calculation

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.020
and payment records also on wages.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.880
The documents on which the

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.840
business transactions are made, come

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.340
to your accountant, where they are subjected

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.860
to three types of checks.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.060
This is a formal check, when the accountant

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.060
checks the correctness of the documentation

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.520
in the form, whether all sections

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.180
of the document are filled, whether

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.740
all the details are filled, whether

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.480
they are filled correctly,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.160
whether the details are fully filled.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.520
The second check, the substance

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.860
check of the document, involves

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.020
determining the legality of the

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.920
business transaction, which is documented

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.120
in this document.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.320
And finally, the third check, the arithmetic

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.960
check of the correctness of

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.000
the calculation of the data of the document.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.660
The accountant is obliged to calculate whether

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.800
everything is correct, all data is

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.700
entered in the document.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.540
What should I do to avoid mistakes

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.440
in the first place?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.800
The head of the organization must build

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.340
a scheme of the turnover document.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.260
The person who makes the document,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.360
who checks this document and

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.340
who, on the basis of the document,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.160
already performs either the

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.920
release of the goods or the acceptance

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.420
of the goods, or summarizes

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.000
the work performed.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.440
To analyze typical errors and teach

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.240
all those who are relevant to the design

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.540
of the first-person, the basic

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.980
rules of design.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.660
Organizing the internal control service.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.140
Modern and qualitative registration

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.780
of primary accounting documents,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.040
their transfer within the established

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.680
time for reflection in accounting,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.240
as well as the reliability of

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.020
the data contained in them, are

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.840
provided by the persons who have compiled

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.720
and signed these documents.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.660
An example of the scheme of the turnover

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.080
document is given in your textbook and

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.400
given in a video lecture in the form of a table.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.600
For example, to issue a travel card

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.440
to the driver, this document must

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.480
be drawn up by either a controller or

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.200
a mechanic, or it is drawn up by the

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.480
driver himself.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.140
For what period is this document drawn up?

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.680
For the period of the flight, this document

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.680
must be drawn up daily by the employees of the organization.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.580
Who will process the document?

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.160
The person responsible, the accountant,

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.020
is appointed and these documents

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.180
are processed daily.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.700
When transferred to the archive,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.140
the responsible person is also fixed who must

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.540
hand this document over to the archive,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.680
and the period of transfer to the archive,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.660
for example, after the reporting period.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.580
During the month, the accountant collects

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.700
the travel sheets and eventually submits

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.220
them to the archive.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.400
Other documents are also presented

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.260
in the table.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.320
This is an example of drawing up a schedule

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.800
of a turnover document in a table form.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.400
I want to remind you a little

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.540
about the literary situation.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.420
Think of Bulgakov.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.900
I remembered this dialogue.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.840
Where did this Makhta come from, and who

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.400
knows it?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.520
Did he have a contract with him?

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.560
It must be assumed, was the concerned Vasily

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.580
Stepanovich answered.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.460
If he had to go through

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.000
the accounting system?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.960
All of course, was worried Vasily Stepanovich

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960
answered.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.220
No, replied the accountant, getting more and

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.240
more pale and dividing his hands.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.940
Indeed, neither the accounting

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.480
files, nor the Findirector, nor Lehodeev,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.520
nor Varenoh has any traces

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.780
of the contract.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.280
No accounting rules, no documents,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.100
no conductions.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.020
The fact of the reflection of

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.440
the business transaction in

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.260
accounting and tax accounting is

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.580
present, but the primary documents

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.640
and business contracts are either

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.620
absent in general, or presented

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.000
in dubious copies, or are incomplete.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.000
This is just a date error

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.840
that leads to negative

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.640
and financial consequences

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.700
and tax consequences.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.560
There is a situation where the

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.240
head of the organization does

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.900
not agree with the accountant's opinion.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.320
How in this case?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.300
In the event of disagreements between

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.900
the head of the organization and

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.620
the chief accountant on the performance

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.680
of individual business operations, the

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.560
primary accounting documents on them

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.040
may be accepted for execution with

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.740
the written order of the

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.800
head of the organization.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.460
The manager bears full responsibility

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.980
for the consequences of such

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.440
transactions and the inclusion

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.880
of data about them

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.120
in accounting.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.000
If the manager has ordered, the accountant

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.860
is obliged to include these

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.340
data in the accounting.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.700
If the supervisory authorities

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.340
require the removal of the primary.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.820
Accounting documents may be

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.340
withdrawn only by the preliminary

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.940
investigation and prosecution

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.480
bodies, courts, tax inspections

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.460
on the basis of their decisions

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.080
in accordance with

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.060
the legislation of

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.760
the Russian Federation.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.900
Remember that the withdrawal order should

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.780
contain a clear list of the documents

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.860
withdrawn and the reason for

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.500
their withdrawal.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.300
The withdrawal of documents for simple

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.300
verification is not provided

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.320
by the current legislation.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.580
The chief accountant or other official

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.460
of the organization shall have the right,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.560
with the permission in the presence of representatives

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.640
of the bodies carrying out the withdrawal

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.780
of documents, to remove copies thereof,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.920
indicating the grounds and date of withdrawal.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.040
The form of primary documents

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.480
that are taken to account accountants

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.300
are developed and approved

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.100
by statistical bodies.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.860
At the moment, such forms even

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:59.060
in the classification

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.340
of their homogeneity

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.540
there is quite a large number.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.720
For example, there are forms for the accounting

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.740
of personnel, for the accounting of working

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.060
time and calculations with personnel, for the

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.700
accounting of works in capital construction,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.860
for the accounting of products,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.900
commodity and material values, for the accounting

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.540
of monetary settlements with the

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.580
population, with the use of check-

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.560
in-cash machines, for the accounting

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.080
of trade and cash operations,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.760
for the accounting of inventory results,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.620
for the accounting of basic assets and

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.260
intangible assets, for the accounting

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.960
of materials, for the accounting

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.680
of works in automotive transport and

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.360
so on.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.960
Many of them are received by the accountant

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.060
after these documents pass through the

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.740
hands of the manager or an ordinary

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.700
employee of the organization.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.100
What mandatory details should

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.520
be in these documents?

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720
The name of the document contains the

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.600
financial and economic content

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.680
of the business transaction.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.040
A document without a name, as well

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.920
as documents with an unclear,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.860
poorly readable name, have no

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.540
legal force.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.300
The accountant must understand what

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.380
document he works with to

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.260
determine the business transaction

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.040
he should be registered

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.000
in the accounting.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.140
Often with the name should be indicated

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.820
payment, tax, registration and

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.240
postal details of the parties,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.900
legal entities and individuals

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.700
involved in the conduct of

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.120
this business transaction, which

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.180
is reflected in this document.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.680
A document in which there is

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.580
no name of the details, at least one

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.520
of the parties to the operation, loses

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.600
its addressability and cannot be accepted

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.960
for execution.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.880
A mandatory date is the date of

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.920
drafting the document.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.440
In case of vague writing or

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.160
absence of a date, the document

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.240
loses its period of time in which

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.120
it should be recorded.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.640
In fact, such a document also

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.800
has no legal force.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.380
The content of the business

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.800
operation is also mandatory.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.420
It derives from the name of the

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.500
document in which it is reflected in

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.440
general form.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.080
The need for strict compliance

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.400
of the name of the document

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.640
with the content of the business

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.820
transactions is determined

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.740
by the principle of

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.140
objectivity of registration

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.040
in accounting documents.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.600
The document must contain

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.800
measuring of the economic

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.040
operation.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.480
Measures can be natural in

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.180
units of weight, size,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.440
labor in human hours and money.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.900
According to the law of the Russian Federation

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.680
in rubles, the absence of a meter in

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.860
the document deprives it of the

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.900
accounting basis.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.580
If you have to work with commodity

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.400
values that have the dimension

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.240
of money, but in the money

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.840
marks of other countries, then

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.640
it is allowed to add another

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.020
column to this document, in which

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.600
the units of other countries

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.580
will be converted into the

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.700
unit of Russia in rubles.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.920
The document must have the signatures

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.840
of the responsible persons with the decoding

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.080
of their positions and the names

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.560
of their father.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.680
The first signature must belong to the

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.120
head of the organization,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.340
the credit manager, the director,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.260
for example, the CEO, and the second

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.380
to the chief accountant.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.280
Mandatory details for the

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.100
primary document.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.400
Once again, I will name them, this

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.680
is the name of the document, the

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.440
name of the details of the parties, the

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.500
date of drafting, the content of the

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.380
business transaction, the measuring of the business

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.200
transaction and the signatures of the

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.220
responsible persons.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.440
Failure to comply with any

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.980
of the normative requirements for the

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.180
registration of documents may serve

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.500
as a reason for employees of

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.360
the control bodies to doubt the authenticity

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.700
of the document submitted

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.280
to them, the consequence of which

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.820
may be the exclusion of the

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.340
costs of such documents from

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.520
the cost of the products produced,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.960
the emergence of disputes

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.840
over the correctness of the

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.280
calculation of profits.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.880
Thus, for example, in the absence

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.980
of documents confirming

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.140
the fact of using certain resources

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.140
in the production process,

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.640
during documentary inspection,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.600
tax officials may recognize

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.780
the wrongful write-

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.160
off of costs on the cost

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.600
of products, other negative

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.640
consequences of incorrect

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.960
documentation.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.600
Well, for example, here is the situation first look at.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.040
The calculation of wages by the

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.500
workers for the manufacture of parts

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.200
was made on the basis of orders

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.200
that were not signed by the master

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.120
or the head of the shop.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.880
The absence of the official's

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.700
signature on the work drawing

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.420
may mean both that such work

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.720
was not done at all,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.440
and that the work was

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.900
actually done, but it

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.640
was not necessary.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.840
In the first case, we have the fact

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.420
of counterfeiting documents and

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.180
the fact of theft of money, if

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.300
the worker has already received

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.800
an unjustified wage, as well as

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.620
a low cost of ownership, and in

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.220
the second the irrational

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.820
use of the enterprise and the

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.280
low cost of ownership.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.660
In this case, the organization

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.040
will have to look for other ways

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.620
to prove the actual implementation

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.240
of costs and their

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.520
production orientation.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.800
One of the evidence can be documents

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.580
confirming the delivery of ready

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.000
parts to the warehouse, to

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.220
the warehouse.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.120
However, in order to prove that the

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.720
parts made by incorrectly decorated

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.520
clothes were delivered to the warehouse,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.600
it will be necessary to analyze

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.580
all available documents in

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.880
the organization, the movement

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.560
of materials and finished products

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.220
and make an inventory

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.180
in the warehouse.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480
As you can see, obtaining

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.320
evidence, although possible, is

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.300
quite time-consuming.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.300
And with the running accounting,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.540
when the wrongly drawn documents

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.260
are enough, it is probably difficult

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.880
to at all.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.280
The next situation in the invoice for

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.220
receipt from the warehouse of materials

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.080
is not a date.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.000
The absence of a date in the invoice

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.640
for receiving materials from the warehouse

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.720
does not allow to establish in

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.160
what reporting period the

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.900
materials were received.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.640
To establish this, again, you

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.220
will have to make an inventory

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.520
of materials and products

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.500
made with their use.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.160
To carry out a comparative analysis

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.740
of material movements, allowances

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.280
for use in production and delivery

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.960
of finished products for

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.340
each reporting period.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.340
Compare the data obtained with the data

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.900
on the implementation of the finished products.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.320
Time of first.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.420
The primary accounting documents should

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.040
be drawn up at the time of the economic

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.160
transaction, and if this is impossible

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.300
for objective reasons,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.660
then immediately after its

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.440
completion.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.020
This is due to the fact that the

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.640
main purpose of primary accounting

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.180
documents is to fix the fact

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.980
of the economic transaction.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.140
In order to ensure that the document

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.040
flow is not overloaded, according

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.580
to the legislation of the Russian

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.980
Federation, the organization can refine

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.960
the recommended standard forms of documents

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.140
taking into account the specifics

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.220
of its activities.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.540
For example, add additional details.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.290
Organizations issue cash

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.210
to employees for the account

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.830
of operating expenses in the amount

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.670
and for the time period determined

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.150
by the manager.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.770
Persons receiving cash under the report

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.470
are obliged not later than three

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.370
working days after the expiry of

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.850
the period for which they are issued,

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.830
or from the day of return from a business

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.730
trip, to present to the accounting

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.010
office a document called

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.890
an advance report.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.050
Report on the expended amounts and

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.230
make a final calculation on them.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.310
In practice, it is often the case

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.010
when an employee acquires for his own

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.790
account for the needs of the

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.390
employer any material values, not only

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.070
without receiving money, but even

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.350
without having permission to act in

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.190
the interests of the organization.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.810
Such authorization to act in the interests

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.350
of the organization gives it a mandate

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.090
from the organization.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.910
If the order of the head to issue an

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.290
advance is absent, it turns

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.610
out that the employee of

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.650
the organization has bought any

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.070
property, and then sells it

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.510
to his home office.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.530
Therefore, when the enterprise pays

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.930
off the debt to the employee,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.630
there is not the issuance of excess

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.410
expenses, but the payment of property

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.830
under the contract of sale and receipt

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.330
of the natural person already

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.330
receiving income.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.150
There is a limit of cash

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.830
payments between legal

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.690
entities or between

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.090
a legal entity and individual

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.750
entrepreneurs.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.130
This is 100,000

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:45.110
rubles per contract.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.150
This is the Bank of Russia.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.790
There is an orbit practice that

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.290
shows that the responsibility

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.370
in case of exceeding

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.350
the limit should be engaged

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.330
only the party contributing

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.910
funds above the established

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.090
limit.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.470
What if in the outpouring of

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.090
the primary document, say, the

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.190
same bills are inaccuracies,

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.630
and if the cash document

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.910
is issued?

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.010
Corrections to cash and bank

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.230
documents are not allowed, and in

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.090
the other primary accounting

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.610
documents corrections may

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.790
be made in agreement with

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.450
the persons who have drawn

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.810
up and signed these documents.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.290
This must be confirmed by the signatures

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.750
of the same persons, indicating the

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.050
date of the correction.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.550
More details can also be read

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.030
in the textbook.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.390
Let us take an example of corrections.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.050
The master of the sewing shop, a person

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.770
who is materially responsible,

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.830
issued a complaint for the receipt

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.590
of 120 meters of satin green

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.250
from the warehouse.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.770
The head of the sewing shop,

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.990
signing the request for a bill,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.590
ordered to get 150 meters of fabric.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.010
To correct the mistake, the master

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.610
of the sewing shop must scratch

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.330
the inscription 120, put 150 and

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.930
write "corrected" by 150 next

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:15.730
to it.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.230
Under the correction record

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.090
is the date of correction.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.690
Corrective record is certified by the signature

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.130
of the master with the indication of his

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.670
post of the surname of the head of the shop.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.210
Subsequently, the other persons

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.570
who will sign this document must

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.830
also submit their signature under

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.010
the correctional record.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.510
Head of the Supply Department, warehouse

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.950
warehouse.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.070
Thus, if the correction is made at

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.590
the initial stage of drafting

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.550
the document, it is better not

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.350
to correct it, probably, but to

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.890
make it again.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.670
For tax purposes, the

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.370
same primary documents

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.230
are accepted as those used

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.310
in accounting.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.310
Examples can also be found

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.790
in the e-book.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.170
Financial transactions

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.290
with cash.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.050
I want to stop a little on this process.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.490
Types of transactions are the receipt of

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.070
cash from the bank, the conclusion of

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.810
a contract, a loan.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.190
The list of persons who have the right to

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.930
sign the primary accounting documents

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.330
shall be approved by the

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.930
head of the organization in

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.510
agreement with the chief accountant.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.470
Documents that are issued for economic

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.130
transactions with funds shall be

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.970
signed by the heads of

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.810
the organization, the chief accountant

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.250
or the persons authorized

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.050
by them.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.350
Without the signature of the chief

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.710
accountant or the person authorized

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.810
by him, the financial and

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.190
credit obligations shall

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.330
be considered invalid

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.250
and shall not be accepted

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.850
for execution.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.530
If there is a situation when a document

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.430
is required to be signed by a

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.070
person, but it is not indicated in

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.370
the list of persons entitled to sign

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.010
the relevant documents, then the

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.330
employee must be authorized to

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.330
perform these actions by a special

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.810
order of the head of the organization.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.990
This order must be issued

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.270
by the accountant.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.770
If authorization is issued

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.930
for the signing of monetary or

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.370
settlement documents, as well as

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.730
financial or credit obligations,

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.630
or the employee shall

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.370
be granted a corresponding

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.090
authorization.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.330
If a document is signed by an inappropriate

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.390
person, the validity

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.690
of such a document is

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.290
disputed.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.110
And any of the parties to the transaction,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.690
as well as third parties on this

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.250
basis, may insist on recognizing

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.050
the invalidity of not only the

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.010
document, but the transaction itself.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.970
If the organization subsequently approves

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.170
the actions performed by the employees,

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.010
the economic transaction under

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.130
the Russian legislation shall

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.970
be considered to have been performed

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.510
on behalf of the organization.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.490
What happens if accounting

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.670
documents are lost?

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.250
Let us try to estimate the extent of the disaster.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.470
There are different

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.330
types of liability, administrative

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.650
and criminal liability.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:25.850
In what cases?

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.670
The loss of accounting documents is

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.430
the responsibility of not only

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.990
the organization, but also

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.330
its officials.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.450
For violation of the terms and procedure

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.110
for storage of documents

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.710
administrative fines

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.790
on officials.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.970
Officials mean the CEO,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.890
accountant or the person

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.850
responsible for the

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.950
security of documents.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.950
The amount of administrative fine can

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.110
be imposed in the amount of 2 to 3

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.850
thousand rubles.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.150
Officials of the organization

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.630
are also subject to criminal

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.890
liability for non-representation of

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.230
accounting documents, tax

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.690
authorities, and if these actions

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.950
have resulted in failure to pay

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.870
taxes in a large or large amount.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.610
Let us introduce a group

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.510
of documents

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.950
such as orders.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.290
As I said, they are subject

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.050
to various orders, powers,

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.390
contracts and contracts.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.110
We will pay more attention to contracts and contracts.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.550
On the basis of such

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.630
an ordering document, such as

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.710
a contract or contract,

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.890
you can form a number of primary

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.310
accounting documents.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.590
A goods accompanying document, for example,

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.190
for the shipment of

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.210
goods and material values.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.230
Payment document for payment

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.470
of received values, act of

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.930
performed works, rendered services

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.810
and so on.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.050
The choice of type of contract and

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.010
errors in the drafting of the contract

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.070
can lead to serious tax consequences.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.890
In order to ensure the correctness of

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.870
accounting and tax accounting, it is recommended

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.990
to write, in addition to accounting

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.030
policies, also a contractual policy.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.810
An example of such a contractual policy,

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.450
the basis of its drafting, I want

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:21.990
to give an example of a sale transaction.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.570
Let us consider the four situations that

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.290
may arise during the transaction.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.450
The contract provides for

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.850
the prior payment of goods, and the right

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.370
of ownership passes at the time

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.490
of their shipment.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.930
Is it beneficial to the buyer?

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.190
Is it beneficial to the supplier?

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.470
Let us look at more in detail.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.130
The buyer at this point has

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.470
a distraction of the isoborot

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.290
funds, and the supplier has

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.610
a free loan.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.050
Conditions are advantageous for the seller and not

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.310
advantageous for the buyer.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.130
If the pre-payment of goods is

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.390
provided by the contract, and

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.710
the right of ownership passes only

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.750
at the time of their payment,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.510
the buyer becomes the owner

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.830
of the goods.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.010
The goods can be resold by the

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.490
buyer directly from the supplier's warehouse.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.050
The VAT on the goods can be presented

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.290
by the buyer.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.130
Conditions are advantageous for the buyer,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.710
but the seller is also advantageous,

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.030
because money for the goods he receives

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.290
immediately at the time of

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.710
shipment of the goods.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.810
The following situation is when

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.390
the contract provides for subsequent

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.070
payment of goods, and the right

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.030
of ownership passes at the time

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.570
of their shipment.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.050
The seller loses the right

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.150
of ownership of the goods and

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.410
thus credits the buyer.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.930
The buyer before their payment is

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.450
given free goods credit.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.410
Conditions are advantageous for the buyer and not advantageous

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.990
for the seller.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.110
Subsequent payment of goods with

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.790
transfer of ownership at the time

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.230
of payment.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.790
This is a very interesting situation when

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.270
the seller organizations seem to insure themselves

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.430
against delays in the performance of

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.270
the buyer’s conditions in the payment

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.490
of the goods.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.150
But in practice, the buyer, having received

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.450
the goods, begins to resell them before

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.930
the moment of payment.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.430
And tracking this situation is difficult,

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.870
especially if the batches of goods are large.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.370
This option of concluding a contract

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.370
is effective for the seller only

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.730
in relation to certain goods, or

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.390
individual, or some artificial

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.190
deliveries.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:50.910
Then we will talk about the price of the

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:56.010
transaction, which can be fixed by the contract.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.130
The party to the contract shall,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.350
except for cases specially specified

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.070
by regulatory documents,

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.370
independently, at its

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.750
discretion, establish the

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.570
price of the contract and

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.590
the conditions for its possible change.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.690
I want to focus your attention here on

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.810
the fact that in the contract

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.010
is obligatory, in addition to the price

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.430
and the transaction, also

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:28.090
the value added tax.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.830
If you forget to write this in the

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.770
contract, then there may be a situation

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.790
that your counterparty will require

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.210
a supplementary payment under

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.150
this contract in the amount

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.870
of value added tax.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.590
That is, in any case, you

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.110
must write in the contract, or

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.170
include the agreed price value

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.910
added tax, or this tax is charged

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.190
above the transaction price

00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:00.250
and specify this amount.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.610
In cases where the price is not provided

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.650
for in the contract and cannot be determined

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.170
on the basis of the terms of the contract,

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.770
that is, the performance

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.390
of the contract must be paid at

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.830
the price that is usually charged

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.310
for similar works or services

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.990
under comparable circumstances.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.250


00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.390
According to the general rules, this

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.010
is the Vienna Convention.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.590
Choosing a contractor must

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.970
also be smart.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.950
Before entering into a contract, you

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.910
need to inquire about the legal

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.890
status of your counterparty.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:42.230
Is it an organization of the common

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.170
taxation system or has it adopted

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.110
a simplified taxation system?

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.790
If the enterprise purchases

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.750
a good, work, service, and

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.890
is itself a VAT payer, it is

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.210
important for it that the

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.930
value of the goods

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.430
it purchases includes this

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.490
tax, which could be taken

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.930
into account.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.690
That is, the contractor under

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.230
the contract, the supplier, is also

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.850
a VAT payer.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.530
I want to show you this in a simple

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.350
number example.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.750
Let us consider two options.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.250
In the first version,

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.810
consumable materials

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.110
are purchased from organizations

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.630
that are not a VAT payer.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.530
In the second option, the consumable

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.990
materials will be purchased

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.550
from organizations that are

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.310
VAT payers.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.990
The calculations are in your eyes, you

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.370
can see them.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:48.410
VAT to the budget with the products that

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.310
you manufacture, in the first

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.070
option will be, say, there 9 thousand

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:57.150
rubles, in the second option it will

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.290
be less than 3,600.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.590
This already determines the outflow

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.930
of cash in the first option, it

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.830
is much more than in the second.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.450
And we will also calculate the taxable profit.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.770
The first option will make a profit

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.170
of about 11 thousand rubles, the second

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.150
option more than 20 thousand

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.030
rubles.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.810
Decide which deal will be more

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.290
profitable for you.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.890
The correctness of the registration of

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.970
the first-hand and the administrative

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.970
documents can significantly affect the

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.850
financial result of the enterprise.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.930
The form of the primary documents can

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.330
be adapted to the specifics of the enterprise.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.730
To avoid risks, training and regulation

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.270
of the activities of employees

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.310
that are relevant to the registration

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.990
of the first-rate is necessary.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.070
The buughter and lawyer of the organization

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.170
are your internal advisors on the issues

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.050
of minimizing the risks associated

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.890
with the incorrect registration

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.590
of the first letter and

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.790
the regulatory documents.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.930
In conclusion, I want to tell you that

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.650
I firmly believe that understanding

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.750
the financial reporting of an accounting

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.730
analyst will improve your

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.830
business growth prospects.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.710
You never start playing football

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.590
without knowing the rules of

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.390
the game.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.210
Knowledge of the basics of financial games

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.730
gives you the opportunity to look at your

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.310
work with a fresh look, to evaluate your

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.810
personal performance better than before,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.770
to increase the profitability

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.950
of your business.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.930
Now you can ask more professional

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.270
questions and your chief accountant,

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.290
for example.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.370
How does it choose specific

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.130
time frames for depreciation?

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.730
Maybe when he gets the first

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.950
shock, he will also ask for

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:13.910
advice.
