00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
Hello, my name is Evgeny Lunyov. I am a candidate for Sociological Sciences and I consult a number of foreign and domestic companies,

00:17.000 --> 00:36.000
including American Primetime Trading, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, domestic holding Temco Group, C. Bartles, German company Arpades Group, Moldovan company Universcom.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are starting a course on information technology for a manager, which you can take on the MBS Start program.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
This course is aimed at business processes managers, regardless of their position in the business management structure.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
This course is suitable for managers, who have business processes as a typical function of marketing, logistics,

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
and for those managers, who have a strategic decision-making structure in the market uncertainty.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Unfortunately, there is no textbook or source of information, where you can get all the knowledge for IT for business or IT for a manager.

01:23.000 --> 01:34.000
This is understandable, because the existing knowledge sector is a cross-section of three layers of knowledge, namely, knowledge about business,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
management, marketing, management of personnel, business analytics, and so on.

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
The second layer is information science, information science is information technology, computing, programming, and so on.

01:50.000 --> 02:04.000
The third layer is the humanities, sociology, psychology, economics, at least, in the part of mathematical patterns in the psychological behavior of people.

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
Therefore, the first lecture will be devoted to the general humanitarian vision of our society, how different groups of experts and specialists assess the society in which we live.

02:15.000 --> 02:31.000
The next lecture will be devoted to the view of information technologies or computer science on the information system, in particular, on corporate systems.

02:31.000 --> 02:44.000
These two lectures will help us understand the next four lectures, which are devoted to the view of business, both on society and on the information technology and systems as a whole.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
The methodical course is designed to show the maximum integrity of the view of information technology and systems.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
It consists of three-level analysis models.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
First, we consider the social level, that is, the level of the state.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
The second level is the level of the group or corporation.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
And finally, the third level is the individual level or the level of the manager.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Why is this analysis system adopted?

03:19.000 --> 03:30.000
Because at all levels we have the same situation, namely, the choice and decision-making.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
So, the first lecture is the evolution of views on the society associated with information.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
First, let's discuss the concept of the theories of the information society.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Let's talk about modern society.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Why has information become the driving force of this society?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Why do people think so?

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
What is hidden in the concept of information?

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Why do many people consider information to be the main problem of modern society?

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
What is the common point of agreement of all scientists, experts, specialists, analysts?

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
We live in a world where the digital universe is expanding rapidly.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Our digital universe is becoming more and more saturated with information.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
The most comprehensive example is the report of the Adies company in March 2007.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I would like to say a few words about this company,

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
because we will often refer to the results of this company's activities in the course.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Adies is the leading and most reliable supplier of reliable and important information,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
helping customers understand the trends of the development of the electronic business

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
and developing reliable business management strategies.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
The company has approximately 700 specialists in 43 countries around the world

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
and provides consultations on almost all levels and areas of the introduction of information technologies and systems.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
The link to the company's website is provided in the textbook.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I recommend you to include it in the folder of your personal computers and laptops.

05:19.000 --> 05:30.000
According to the Adies company, the total amount of all data recorded and re-recorded in 2006 was 161 exabytes of information.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
In 2010, this figure will reach 988 exabytes.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Exabytes is a unit of information equal to approximately 2 to the 60th degree.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
I just can't imagine what could correspond to this figure.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
This is a very large figure.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
So, until 2010, we have, in fact, a 57% annual growth in the volume of information.

06:03.000 --> 06:13.000
Corporate information is slightly smaller in volume and in 2010 it will be only 30% of the total volume of information in the world.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Nevertheless, corporate information will be associated with 85% of all data in our digital universe.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
This means that the importance and role of business will only grow.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
Scientists and experts have divided the influence of the digital universe on public development into two equal groups.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
The supporters of the first group say in interviews, newspapers, articles and books that we live in an electronic society,

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
that we are controlled by the knowledge economy or the virtual economy,

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
and that all progressive countries strive to enter the global information society.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
The representatives of this group are Daniel Bale with his theory of post-industrialism,

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
which for several decades has been predicting very well how our society will develop.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Next, Jean Badiar and Marc Poster with the theory of post-modernism,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
which is very popular, especially among young people,

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
that the signs around us are just an ocean, with which we are forced to interact.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
We are surrounded by signs everywhere and we live and exist in them.

07:29.000 --> 07:40.000
Marc Pajor and Charles Sable with their theory of flexible specialization have proven that we live in the post-Ford era,

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
that small enterprises can easily compete with large ones for a consumer and a client.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Manuel Castells and his theory of the information method of development,

07:51.000 --> 08:03.000
with meritocracy and a network society, will predict information capitalism in all its diversity.

08:03.000 --> 08:13.000
The second group of scientists and experts believes that everything that is happening is just the informationization of established relations.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
The information has really grown and has some significant value,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
but still the main feature of our society, according to the scientists of the second group,

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
is the continuity with respect to the past.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
The supporters of the second group are Herbert Schiller with his theory of neo-Marxism,

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
Alain Lippitz with his theory of regulation, Anthony Giddens with his theory of reflexive modernization,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
and JÃ¼rgen Habermas with his theory of the public sphere.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
All of them say that the public sphere, namely museums and libraries,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
is declining because the value of information is declining.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
The theory of regulation and neo-Marxism tells us that capitalism has been and still is,

09:01.000 --> 09:14.000
and the fact is that a person or a group of people needs more rigid information support and information control.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Everything else remains unchanged.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Many people ask themselves what is happening now and what will happen in the future.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
This is understandable, because we constantly face a situation of choice.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Is it a family that chooses the path of its child's future, that is, a profession,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
or is it a corporation that introduces some kind of information system,

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
or is it some kind of state level that faces problems with the introduction of the electronic government

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
or elements of the electronic government into practice.

09:45.000 --> 09:55.000
We will not tell you which of these groups of our scientists is on the right or left.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
I will send you the books of Frank Webster, the theory of the information society,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
in which all these theories are described in detail.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Nevertheless, when meeting these people with their names in articles, interviews,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I draw your attention to the fact that you should not miss them.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
These are really the titans of our social thought, which sees a little further than ordinary people.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
We will only focus on the analysis of the general features of modern society

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
and will translate the arguments for and against from both groups of experts

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
so that each of you can decide for yourself in which society we live in and which society is closer to your understanding.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
But before that, let's first emphasize the importance of the influence of information on the work of a manager.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So, the importance of the phenomenon of information for a manager.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Let's turn to the data of the company Adies.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
According to its research, in American companies, employees working with information

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
spend about 14.5 hours a week reading and writing e-mails,

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
13.3 hours on compiling documents,

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
9.6 hours on searching for information and 9.5 hours on its analysis.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
If we take the level of a corporation, in which about a thousand people work,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and they are connected with information,

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
then the reformatting of data and transferring data from one program to another

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
takes or the company loses about 5.7 million dollars.

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
And the costs of unsuccessful data and information search are still 5.3 million dollars per year.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
This is a colossal amount for the company.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
But not only the minimization of losses and costs when working with information is important for the manager.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
The work of a manager is, in fact, informational in its nature

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
and is aimed at managing corporations, personnel, technologies.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
This includes both management itself and marketing,

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
that is, management and development of products or services, as well as the market of sales.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Targeting, targeted marketing or management,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
is also important, aimed at conquering new markets of sales,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
to achieve any significant indicators for the economy and business.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Therefore, we come to a very important conclusion.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
Namely, information flows are not only a possible threat to the manager's activities,

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
but also bring potential opportunities for his successful work.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Therefore, the task is to learn to navigate in the ocean of your information environment

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
and extract valuable information, which will be the most competitive advantage for you as a manager.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Let's look at the features and criteria of the information society.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
They are all related to the identification of the parameter of novelty.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
What new information has our society brought?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Its quantitative growth.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Usually, there are four significant criteria of the information society.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Namely, the innovation and technological criteria,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
the second is the economic criteria,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
the third is the cultural criteria,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
and the fourth is related to the field of employment.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Let's take a closer look at each of these criteria.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Since the 1970s, new technologies have become one of the most noticeable advances of the new times.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, really.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
Satellite, cable television, Internet, computer networks, DVD, CD, and so on.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Therefore, the leading futurologist Alvin Toffler

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
in 1980 introduced a memorable metaphor.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
Namely, the world is gradually being formed under three waves of technological innovations.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
The first was the agricultural revolution,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
approximately in the Middle Ages.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Then the second wave was the industrial revolution,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
which is already closer to us.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And the third wave, which is now coming,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
or which has already entered our shores,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
is the information revolution.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Later, his futuristic prognosis was supported by the possibility of computer technologies

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
to transform telecommunications,

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
that is, to combine two technologies, computer and communication,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
which made it possible to introduce information networks,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
online, web, Internet, and so on.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
At the moment, the distribution of digital communication technologies,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
such as e-mail, data transfer, texts,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
and information exchange in online mode

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
is the reason for the formation of a new network society.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Therefore, the question is logical.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
Why not consider the avalanche of information and communication technologies

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
as a sign of the emergence of a new society?

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Since we did it, for example, with the industrial society.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
The steam boiler, electricity,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
all this was a sign of the industrial revolution,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
and the information and communication technologies are the signs of the information society.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
However, two facts are worth mentioning here,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
which I have highlighted separately.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
The first fact is that none of the 19th and 20th century fantasists

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
could predict the advent of the Internet era.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Well, the most complete approach to them, in my opinion,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
was Stanislav Lem.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
This is a Polish writer, satirist, philosopher, and fantasist,

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
who lived from 1921 to 2006.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
In his book Solaris, published in 1961,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and in Russian in 1963,

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
he described our communication with artificial intelligence

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
or with the low-Earth civilization.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
But he did not approach the understanding of the Internet

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
and the development of information and communication technologies

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
that we have at the moment.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
The question is why the disillusioned fantasy of many authors and fantasists

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
could not describe the advent of the era of information and telecommunication technologies.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
The second fact is that before the appearance of the metaphor

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
and the works of the leading futurologist Elvin Toffler

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
and his numerous successors,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
on April 19, 1965,

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
the Electronic Magazine published an article by the young chemist Gordon Moore.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
He analyzed the development of the microelectronics industry at that time

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
and wrote a short phrase that

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
the number of elements of microchips of the minimum value

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
doubles every 12 months at an unchanged price.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
Subsequently, when Gordon Moore became the head of Intel,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and, as you know, this global company owns, in fact,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
80% of all PCs,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
that is, the personnel of computers,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
is one of the leading in this area in the world,

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
this law was transformed into the following.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
The computing power of microprocessors and the density of memory microchips

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
doubles every two years at an unchanged price.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
After a while, the Intel Corporation introduced a new law

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
on behalf of another inventor,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
namely, Robert Merkel,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
who is the father of the Ethernet network protocol.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
The law states that the value of the entire network

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
grows approximately as a square of its number of components.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
This law was also adopted.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
The thoughts about the network effect,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
network markets, network marketing,

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
and even the idea of society as not from citizens,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
but as from networks, began to be formed.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
I want to illustrate the Metcalfe law on a slide.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
This slide shows an illustration of the Metcalfe law,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
where the number of network members is 4.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
This gives approximately 12 connections.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That is, if two network members are a two-dimensional connection,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
three is already 6,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
four is 12,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
five members is already 20,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and so on.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Meanwhile, the laws of Moore and Metcalfe

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
do not have a social basis.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
Blind research can lead to sad consequences.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
In fact, there was a dispute here,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
and society was subjected to

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
such a great influence of technocratic ideas,

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
which came from the Intel company,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
and which were picked up by many humanitarians,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
and from which these theories later emerged.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And this general boom,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
when technologies began to prevail over the social context,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and influenced the fact that,

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
for example, the blind research of the Metcalfe law

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
was felt by investors and people

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
who invested in the Internet of Technologies in 2000.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It was the collapse of the Dotcom boom in 2000

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
that blind research was attributed to the Metcalfe law,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
that networks are capable of generating new value on their own.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
The Moore law is still old,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
it has been in operation for 40 years,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
and will probably remain unchanged,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
at least according to the estimates of its creator,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
for 15 years.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
But in order to clearly define our society as information,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
we need to give certain answers to the questions.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
What are they?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Namely, when does the network become a network?

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Why, when the telephone and telegraph were invented,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
no one thought of calling our society information,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
and in fact, it is also a network?

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
How many information and communication technologies are needed

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
to qualify our society as information?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
If we put technology,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
and not the social context itself,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
the social interaction of people,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
we can come to such societies as,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
for example, the widespread distribution of bio-additives,

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
which can allow us to call our society a bio-additive society,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
automobile, the widespread development of the automobile society,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
a car society, and so on.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
What is this related to?

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
This is the attitude to information and communication technologies.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
This is due to the fact that for the 50s, 70s and 80s,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
investments in the information industry

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
or in information technology

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
were comparable to the gigantic investments in the military business,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
that is, with military expenses.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
As you know, humanity has already reached a level

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
that can destroy itself tens of thousands of times.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
The question is, who needs it?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Why did we develop to such a state?

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
In fact, the same can be said about information technologies,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
when money was spent only there.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
We have a subjective nature to make decisions.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
If we take into account that many medical problems

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
are not solved by humanity yet,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
we can understand that some common sense

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
in the distribution of expenses between military,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
information and communication, and medical,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
we need to correct.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I mean, I come to the conclusion

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
that the separate leading role of information and communication technologies

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
in social changes is very dubious.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
The second economic criterion

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
is related to the fact that the share of the information business

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
in the national product has increased.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Also, due to the effectiveness and activity

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
of information circulation in the economic sphere,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
it gives more effect in money

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
compared to industry or agriculture.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Another argument is that many countries

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
such as the USA, Japan, and Europe

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
have become information societies,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
since the main place in their economies

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
is the activity of the production of information products

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and information services.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
However, despite the increasing role of information,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
we should consider arguments against it.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
The first argument is that it is not clear

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
what criteria are used in the statistical table

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
for different categories of human activity.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
If we define this work as informational,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
why did it get there?

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
How can we divide the work of a call center operator

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
and an innovator manager,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
who belongs to the same industrial enterprise?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Where will we put them?

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
In the information statistical table or in the industrial one?

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
The next argument is that in the historical perspective,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
according to the Moore's law,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
the cost of information services and products

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
is constantly falling in the world.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
While we are now observing that the prices

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
of industrial resources and agricultural products

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
are constantly rising.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Moreover, the so-called information countries,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
this will be the third argument against,

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
which are the leaders in the information sphere,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
at the same time,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
they are also the most resource-consuming.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
More than half of the resources on the planet Earth

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
are consumed by these so-called information countries.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
The fourth criterion, which I highlight,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
is that despite the unprecedented growth

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
of advertising and television in the economy,

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
nevertheless, the economic efficiency

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
of these phenomena is more than dubious.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Indeed, the yellow press, in fact,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
has flooded all our kiosks and counters.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Nevertheless, what information value,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
that is, they carry some information load,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
but the economic value is very dubious.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Therefore, the key answer to the question

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
about the growing role of economic information

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and other information products

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
should be, first of all,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
the answer to the question of what society

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
we want to build, form or create.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
If we want to create a society

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
that will consume only information products,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
and access to valuable things,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
such as oil and gas,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
will be closed to the main members of society

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
and will be offered only to the chosen ones,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
then it will be very beneficial

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
to call our society informational.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
In fact, here you create your information products,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
here you have a show, cartoons,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
please consume them,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
but do not pay attention to the resources,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
the real resources that are valuable.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
The fourth argument against this

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
is the fact that despite the unprecedented growth,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
the unprecedented growth of advertising

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
and television in the economy,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
which should be a sign of an informational society,

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
in general, is a dubious economic purpose and role.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Therefore, I draw to the intermediate conclusion

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
that the key answer to the question

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
about the growing role of economic information

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and other information products

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
should be the answer to the question

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
what kind of society we want to build,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
form and create.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
If we want to create a society

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
where there will be an economic price tag

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
for each product and service

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
for which we have to pay

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
and there will be nothing free,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
as it was in our past societies,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
then this society will be a good example

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
for some, especially economists,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
and those who have access

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
to the real sources of income of the country,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
it will be beneficial for them

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
to call our society informational.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
However, a lot, especially in terms of social,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
especially for those categories of people

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
who are involved only in public life

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
or who leave it, that is, the older generation,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
will not be able to do it for free.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Therefore, the growing role of economic purpose

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
or economic role of information products

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
is not quite the right goal

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
of the development of society.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
A lot in our society should be done

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
in the non-economic sphere,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
outside the access of economists

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
to the fact that they put price tags

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
on information products and services.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
The next criterion is a cultural criterion.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Each of us knows that the circulation of information

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
in social life has increased enormously.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
In fact, we live in such a media society

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
in which neither our fathers nor our grandfathers lived.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
However, despite the increasing amount of information

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
in the cultural sphere,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
we still have a lot of information

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
and we have a paradox.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
The paradox is that the information explosion

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
led to the dissolution of meaning.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Jean Baudillard,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
one of the founders of postmodernism,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
wrote well about this.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
In 1983, he wrote

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
that the amount of information is increasing,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
but the meaning is decreasing.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
We live among these simulacra.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Simula is a Latin word for pretending,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
pretending or a copy,

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
that is, an original.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
In fact, from the point of view of postmodernists,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I am advertising my image.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
In this case, it is an image of a tutor

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
on the MBS Start program.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
We are surrounded by these simulacra.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
There is nothing real around us.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
These are idealized,

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
sign products of culture

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
that have lost their connection

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
with real objects.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
This is what a simulacra is in the usual sense.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
It is the creative specialists

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
who have self-reflection,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
self-awareness and are very productive

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
and create this culture of copies,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
easily distort,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
interpret and break their original meaning.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
This is why it is so popular

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
on television

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
or in the corporate environment

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
various shows, kitsch, analogies.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
But we must remember one thing.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Whatever society we live in,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
it lives on its moral and ethical principles

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
that have nothing to do with information.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Remember them.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Namely,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
you live for yourself and let others live.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
All people are created equal.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
This is my country,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
whether it is right or not, and so on.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
What did the century of information give us?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Time is money.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Who owns information, owns the world.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
I think that we can hardly build a normal society

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
on these principles.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The next criterion is related to the occupation.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
This is the last criterion

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
that we will consider as a sign of an information society.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
It is related to the structure of the population's occupation

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
and the models of changes observed.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
It is known that in Western Europe, Japan, North America

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
more than 70% of the workforce

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
is engaged in the service sector.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
So, the so-called white-collar work prevails.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
It will be a little more difficult

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
to deal with this criterion

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
than with the innovation and technology.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Because here not some technology

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
affects the brain,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
but the information is promoted in the brain.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
How is it produced in the field of occupation

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
and how is it realized through education and experience.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
It is believed that the driving force of the modern economy

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
will be people whose main ability

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
is to use information.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
It will be system analysts,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
niche finders, designers, experts, and so on.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
The common sense remains constant.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
The main drivers in the economy are those

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
whose work requires the creation and use of information.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Therefore, it is quite logical

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
that a coal miner is an industrialist,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
and an expert is already a member of the information society.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
So, in order to consider the criteria

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
related to the super-capacity,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
we will analyze a small business case.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
In September 2006,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
a case was handled

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
with the state corporation Comcor.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
The fact is that this corporation

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
created a call center in Tula

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
for 600 agency places,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
the largest in Russia.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
In Moscow, where the minimum wage of operators

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
is 15-20 thousand rubles,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
and the minimum wage of a licensed agent

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
is 40 thousand rubles,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
it is not profitable for businessmen

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
to pay such salaries.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
In addition, the current situation is high.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
People work for half a year and leave.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
The company Comcor and its director Grishin

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
chose Tula as the least

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
outsourced by the region.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
The company offered them

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
from 8 to 12 thousand rubles

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
for those who initially

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
became operators,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
and for advanced operators

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
from 16 thousand rubles.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
This is very profitable

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
for both Tula and Comcor owners.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
The company offered

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
from 8 to 12 thousand rubles

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
for those who initially

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
became operators,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
and for advanced operators

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
from 16 thousand rubles.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
By the end of 2007,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
they planned to complete

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
all the workplaces,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
that is, to hire 1,500 operators.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
But they hired 1,500 new information workers

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
who came from non-information spheres.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
The average salary of 12-16 thousand rubles per month

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
is unlikely to allow them

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
to significantly change their lifestyle

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
and join the world of the chosen ones,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
that is, specialists of high technologies.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
This is understandable.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
In Russia, there is a double inflation

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
All the management decisions

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
that were made

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
to transfer business from Moscow to Tula

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
have remained unchanged

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
since the pre-information era.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
More is done, less is done.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Moreover, it could be assumed

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
that if the work in the call center

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
would allow operators

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
to grow to the level of the director,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
then we would have some information society

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
because the director can allow himself

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
to change his laptop for a year or two,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
have access to high-value knowledge,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
how to organize a project, etc.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
But the fact is that the harmonious

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
functioning of society itself

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
does not imply the increase of people

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
in the position of the director.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
Not everyone should be a director.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
That is why we have the fact

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
that the work of operators

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
is routine in relation to the work of the director.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
The same can be said about programmers

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
and computer scientists.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
These professions are a symbol

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
of our information age.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
But we have a phenomenon of computer crime

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
among programmers and computer scientists.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
This is a proof that the knowledge

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
that was ingrained in their heads

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
did not affect their motives.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
We all know the hacking,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
the theft of business cards,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
the theft of credit cards, etc.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
All this is done by programmers

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
who have acquired some information knowledge.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Their motives and actions

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
have remained unchanged.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Moreover, we can say that despite the increase

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
in the number of programmers and computer scientists,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
there has been no less increase

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
in the number of social workers.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
And their work, although it is more noble,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
is paid less in society.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
They use less information

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
and less information products

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
than programmers and computer scientists.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
In any case, we need to analyze

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
the information work of a particular worker

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
and determine the quality of his work,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
which will allow him to occupy

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
a certain niche in the hierarchy of society.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
We also need to determine the responsibility

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
of the information society.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Only then can we understand

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
whether the criteria of information occupation

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
can be a sign of an information society.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Today, it can be said that society

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
is already pointless to divide

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
into workers, collective farmers or intelligentsia.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Moreover, even such high-status groups

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
of people as owners or entrepreneurs

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
are becoming a driving force of our society.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
In many countries, including our country,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
the driving force has already become professionals,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
that is, elite groups of people,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
the basis of their activities is service,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
that is, service of a certain area of activity.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Further, certification,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
the presence of some status documents,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
the portfolio of some implemented projects

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and the ability to achieve some goals,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
in particular business goals.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
We see that none of the criteria

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
of information, technological,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
economic, cultural or occupation

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
can be considered as full-fledged concepts

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
by which we can determine our society

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
and its activities.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
We need to understand

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
that the increase in the amount of information

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
cannot mean that we are moving

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
into a high-quality society.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
Therefore, we must answer the question

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
whether the information that surrounds me

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
is useful,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
what can it give me in the future,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
whether it is a threat to me.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
We need to understand

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
that information is not structured

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
by the power of the information.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
At the same time,

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
the information that we can structure,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
manage, analyze,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
becomes less and less

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
in the weight of the general information.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
This is the threat

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
that information brings us.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
We can recall the fathers of the theory of information,

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
namely Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
who in 1949 gave the definition of information

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
as the quantitative estimate of the probability

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
of the frequency of the appearance of symbols

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
associated with the concept of a bit,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
that is, a binary signal that takes values 0 and 1.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Unfortunately, such a definition of information

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
is useful for engineers in communications,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
but it is not useful for us

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
to understand the meaning and value of information.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Information, in fact, exists

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
as space and time exist,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
as commodity-money relations or equivalent relations,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
and other relations.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
We can express ourselves more clearly.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Information is a condition of existence.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
But what?

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
We are surrounded by different objects of reality

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
that we reflect in the senses,

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
calculate, model,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
that is, we transform them into some data.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Data in Latin is a calculation.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
In fact, it is an idealized representation

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
of the environment or reality

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
in some formalized form,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
suitable for transmission and processing

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Idealization occurs through some language

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
consisting of some signs,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
their structures, their relations, etc.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
All this is called a syntax of the language,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
that is, a syntax of the Greek component.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
These data that we receive

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
and transform into the senses

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
can be combined into metadata

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
that explains other data

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
and can be used to create a semantic

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
that is derived from the Greek word

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
meaning.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Semantic is a connection between

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
the syntax signs and objects of reality

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
that these signs describe and reflect.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
The interaction process itself,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
when either reflection or data exchange occurs,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
is called communication.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
If we perform some operations on data,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
for example, assign some value to some data,

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
it will mean connecting them with other data

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
and they already become some indicators

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
or attributes,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
that is, significant characteristics

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
of the properties of the object

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
that we can measure, understand,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
highlight, study.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
There is a very significant point here,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
which is the basis for understanding

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
the subsequent development of the forms of information.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
It is necessary to understand that

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
the indicators of the attributes,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
both the indicators themselves and the operations

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
above them, are just a portion of information

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
that we can judge

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
about the essence of the object and its semantics,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
that is, about its meaning.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
The data itself or the attribute

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
and what we do above it,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
some operation,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
is just a portion of information.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
This slide, in fact,

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
shows the scale of the growth of the value of information.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
The basis, as we said,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
is the data or metadata.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
The difference between information and data

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
can be likened to iron ore and ore.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
When we extract iron from iron ore

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
using some operations,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
it is already some kind of benefit,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
and iron ore in itself is of no value.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Information is, in fact,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
what answers the questions

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
what, who, where, when and how.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
The first question is philosophical,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
and we put it aside.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
We will call information everything

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
and those transformations over data

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
that answer these questions.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Hence, indicators and attributes

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
as a substantial set of information

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
or a portion of information

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
can serve and perform functions

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
to identify objects,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
to determine their structure, static,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
development dynamics and other characteristics.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Of course, we can put any set of indicators

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
in accordance with the number or the duration of the text.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
This will be its values,

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
which may also make some practical sense.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
As an example, you have already studied

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
the so-called key indicators of efficiency,

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
any KPI is an indicator,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
but not all indicators can be a KPI.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
For example, the number of listeners

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
who listened to this IT course for a manager

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
is an indicator, but it is not an indicator of KPI.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
But the number of students who listened

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
to this video course and bought DVD

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
can be a KPI,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
that is, a key indicator,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
at least for the evaluation of the demand

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
of this video course by business school methodologists.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
That is, when we added some more information

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
to the simple indicator,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
we turned it from a simple indicator

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
into a KPI indicator.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
It is important to clarify that the set of indicators

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
can be alienated from the source of their data

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and from the object to which they are assigned.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
They can be stored in certain formats and specifications

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
and have their own history of values,

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
structures and sources.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Further transformation of data into indicators

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
is the third step of our pyramid.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
We can continue in the same way with metadata.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
That is, we can talk about the presence of some kind of

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
meta-information that is based on metadata

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
and can explain them.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
But we must define knowledge

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
in the order of the value scale of the quality of information.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
That is, in this pyramid, in this structure.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Therefore, we limit ourselves to defining

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
the knowledge that defines it

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
as a portion of information

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
explaining how a particular event,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
a fact, a property of an object and so on happened.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
And we define it as a portion of information

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
explaining how a particular event, a fact,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
a property of an object and so on happened.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
This will help us analyze the values of data

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
separate from the object and contained in the database.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
The most common form of describing values

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
is a document.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
From the Latin documentum,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
an example, evidence, evidence.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
This is a kind of materialized reflection

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
of the data and information.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
A document can be presented as a result of

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
converting data and information into significant

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
and semantic knowledge.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
That is, as a rule, the usual documents

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
that we have in business are on the third

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
and third scale of the pyramid.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
If we climb higher in the value scale of the quality of information,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
then from the metadata that explains

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
the value of the information,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
we will move on to the understanding or competence.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
From the Latin word,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
it means I am trying to achieve, I am corresponding, I am approaching.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Usually, the competence is associated with the ability of specialists

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
to solve a certain class of professional tasks.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
But the essential point of defining competence

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
is the understanding of knowledge.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
That is, an explanatory answer to the question

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
why it happened.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
To solve professional tasks,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
you do not always have enough knowledge.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
Therefore, you have to attract knowledge from other specialists.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
Consequently, competence includes

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
both the knowledge that the specialist has

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
and the other knowledge that he can attract,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
for example, from the consultant.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Knowledge about where the other knowledge is

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
that can be attracted to solve a particular task

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
and is the basis of the concept of competence.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
And finally, we have come to the peak of the value scale of the quality of information.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Again, I draw your attention to the slide.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
This is a combination of knowledge and competence,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
which is called the experience of the best practices.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
This type of information is associated with the value of the results

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
and the achievement of the ultimate goal.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Many people associate almost all of this with the value of the knowledge.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Many people associate the experience with competence

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
and the previous stages of the hierarchy, that is, with knowledge and information.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
However, this information, knowledge and competence

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
contribute only to the efficiency

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
of the use of means to achieve the goal.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
But what is the goal itself?

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
What is the value of the result in the goal?

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
And how effective is it achieved?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
That is, the effectiveness of the goal

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
is determined only by the experience of the best practices.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
For example, we all know that medicine treats sick people.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
It is necessary to treat them.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
And it does this very effectively

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
with the help of information technologies.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
But in fact, the Ministry of Health

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
and the medical institutions that surround us

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
are not the only ones who are doing this.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
The Ministry of Health is the only one

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
that should treat not sick people,

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
but those who are healthy.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
That is, their knowledge and competence

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
should be directed to the effective treatment of diseases and sick people,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
instead of their practice

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
and knowledge

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
being directed to the maintenance of health of healthy people.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
Here we have

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
that we have, in fact,

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
all medicine,

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
its goal is the wrong one.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
So, we have come to a very important point.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
To the phenomenon

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
that can really determine

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
something new in our society

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
compared to other historical periods of development.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
In other words,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
we see that on the upper levels of values

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
there is knowledge, competence and the best practice.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
These are, in fact, the derivative concepts of information

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
of the global universe of our digital universe.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
They are generalized and transferred to some carriers

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
and can represent the so-called phenomenon

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
of theoretical knowledge

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
that has really changed the image of our life.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
In fact,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
the thing is that if you want to be successful,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
you have to study all your life.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
This has not happened in any of our previous periods of development.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
That is, once knowledge was passed on

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
in an old way from father to son

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
or there was enough, for example,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
the completion of one educational institution for the rest of your life.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Today, in fact,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
it is no longer a metaphor of words that business is based on knowledge.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Today, the core of intellectual capital

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
is knowledge, competence and the best practice.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
They should be considered as a complex management object,

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
as a strategic resource of any company

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
that should be at every employee

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
with the necessary quality,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
in the required quantity,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
in the right place, at the set time

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
and, preferably, at some acceptable price.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
As has already been noted above,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
the knowledge of the business is the area

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
that is the intersection of three main areas.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
That is, interdisciplinary knowledge in information technologies

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
and information systems is conditioned by the sciences of business management,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
the sciences of information

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
and the humanities.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
We will refer to the report of the company KPMG,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
which examined the practices of knowledge management

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
in 400 companies in the United States and Europe

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
and determined the situation with the analysis of these practices,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
at what level are these or those companies.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
The method is very simple.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
It assigned one to those companies

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
with a low level of maturity

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
and assigned five to those companies

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
that solve their business tasks

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
using knowledge management tasks.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
According to the data of this company KPMG

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
and their research,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
at the first level, that is,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
at the lowest level of maturity,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
there are 43 companies in the United States and Europe,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
at the second and third levels there are 32% of companies,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
at the fourth level there are only 10%

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
and at the highest, fifth level of maturity,

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
there are 1% of companies.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
If we take our Russian reality,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
it will be even more depressing.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Therefore, the practical work number 1 will be considered below

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
and you will be offered

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
a methodology of assessing a company or enterprise

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
on the development of a knowledge management system.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
We suggest you find out the level of development

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
of your enterprise or company.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
Let's summarize the first lecture.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
There is an overwhelmingly technocratic point of view

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
on the level of knowledge management,

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
as well as on the corporate level,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
and on the all-inclusive number of modern information flows,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
which, unfortunately, does not allow to evaluate the role

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
of information in modern society.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
The most productive point of view is that

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
we live in the era of the same relations

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
as our fathers and grandfathers lived.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
That is, our society is characterized by continuity of relations

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
and the development of the new generation of information capitalism.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
The characteristic feature that distinguishes our society

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
from the previous generations is the growth of the significance

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
of theoretical knowledge,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
that is, the knowledge, competences,

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
and best practices that can be generalized,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
encoded and distributed.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
In addition to our course,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
all subsequent considerations of information technologies

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
such as ERP, ERM, BMP

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
are a variety of theoretical knowledge

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
expressed in concepts, approaches,

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
methods, technologies, etc.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
It is important for the manager to understand this language of IT specialists.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
To do this, we will need to prepare the concept of IT

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
or IT system,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
since we did it with the concept of information.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
What is the concept of IT?

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
What is the value of IT and IT system?

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
The main conclusion of the course is that

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
we will be able to master information

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
and gain theoretical knowledge

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
and achieve the goals of survival in the business world

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
in particular, in each case.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
It is necessary to remember the Darwinian saying

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
that the smartest and the most efficient

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
are the ones who survive.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
The smartest and the most efficient are the ones

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
who adapt to the environment.

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
Lecture 2. Structure, Composition and Classification of IT and IT systems

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
First, let's consider the concept of IT and IT systems.

55:16.000 --> 55:25.000
The concept of IT is usually associated with operations on data and information,

55:25.000 --> 55:31.000
such as storage, processing, transfer or exchange of data or information.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
The concept of IT is usually associated with the final set of hardware and software complexes

55:38.000 --> 55:45.000
and various resources that serve certain informational and management purposes.

55:45.000 --> 55:51.000
The slide shows the IT as a process of data and information transfer.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
So, we have the structure of IT,

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
which at a certain level is split into information processes.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
At another level, the information process is distributed

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
according to information procedures,

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
which in turn are divided according to information operations.

56:10.000 --> 56:16.000
Here, in fact, the model of the detailing of the process of data transfer is depicted.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
This is the most general and formal model

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
that allows to describe the processes of obtaining, displaying,

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
accumulating, processing, transfer of data and information,

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
as well as the procedures and operations of collection, preparation,

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
formatting, archiving, search, conversion, logical conclusion,

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
commutation, exchange, generation, and so on.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
The data movement can be organized both horizontally and vertically.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
In fact, everything depends on a specific business process and a given task.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
But the most typical data movement in an IT system is the movement along the contour.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
For example, the financial director collects reports from his departments,

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
groups them, submits them to the management,

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
considers all these reports, makes some instructions,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
sends them to the financial director,

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
the financial director distributes them again to his departments.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
And so, in this cycle, the business process takes place.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
This is called the financial information contour.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
There are three levels of description of IT.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
This is the conceptual or content level,

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
where the content of the subject area structure is described,

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
in the area where IT operates.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Next is the logical level of description,

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
where the formalization of the model of the subject area is carried out.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
And finally, the physical level of description,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
which determines the way of implementing the IT model

57:53.000 --> 57:59.000
obtained at the conceptual and logical level in a technical device or devices.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
The concept of an IT system for the purpose of management

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
is a combination of functional structures of information,

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
mathematical, technical, organizational, personnel,

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
which are united into a single system for the purpose of collecting,

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
storing, processing and issuing the necessary information

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
for the implementation of the functions of management.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
In fact, the IT system, unlike IT technologies,

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
forms a variety of information flows.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
What are they?

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
The information flow from the external environment to the management system.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
For example, there can be a flow of legislative and normative information

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
created by the state institutions in the part of the legislation.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
And also a flow of information about the market structure

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
created by competitors, consumers, suppliers.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
That is, this is one flow that goes from the outside into the management system.

58:52.000 --> 58:58.000
Further, the information flow from the management system to the external environment.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
That is, some kind of accounting information in the same state institutions,

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
tax inspections and other marketing information.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Further, we have an information flow from the management system to the management object itself,

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
which is a set of some kind of planned, normative,

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
administrative documents and information for the implementation of some kind of economic or business processes.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
We also have a reverse flow from the object to the management system,

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
which also reflects some kind of accounting information

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
about the state of the object of management by the economic system.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
That is, the presence of raw materials, money, energy, labor resources,

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
ready-made products, some services, and so on.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
In fact, the information system accumulates, processes the incoming accounting information,

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
converts or acts on the basis of some kind of normatives and plans,

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
on the basis of some kind of analytical information,

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
which serves as a basis for forecasting the development of the economic system itself,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
for the adjustment of its goals, for the creation of plans for a new cycle of reproduction,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and, in fact, for the development strategies in the conditions of some kind of market.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
In fact, when we talk about information technology,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
we mean that it is based on some subsystems or systems.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
When we talk about the system, we, in fact, mean the basis of some kind of information technologies

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
on which the system is based.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
That is, there is a kind of interpenetration of these concepts.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
This is due to the nature of the information itself.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:45.000
If you remember, we said that the indicator and the operation above it are, in fact, pieces of information.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
That is, they are the same.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Here we can apply the same analogy.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
This remark is in relation to the system, the system as an indicator, and the technology as an operation.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That is, the information flows circulating in some system are processed by technologies,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
which, in turn, consist of some subsystems of information processing.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
That is, there is also an interpenetration of the system in technology, and so on.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So, let's consider the conceptual, that is, the substantive level of the description of IT technology.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The conceptual model of information technology consists of processes of obtaining,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
displaying, accumulating, processing, exchanging and forming knowledge and information.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
The dotted lines on the slide limit semantic information from data,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
which is described by syntax.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
That is, in fact, in the center, where the data are, we have a syntax.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
The information we are working with in the process of obtaining, that is, collection, preparation,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
verification, well, maybe before inputting, all this has some semantic meaning.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
That is, it can answer the question of who, what, how, how much and where from.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So, when we convert information into data, here, in fact, the syntax is in charge.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Further, when we extract from the data, again, we get information in the display systems,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:20.000
which can also have a semantic meaning and answer the questions of who, what, how.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And already from the display or from the help of some other means of information systems,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
information technology, we can form knowledge that answers the question of how.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We got one or another indicator, one or another property of the object and so on.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
The conceptual model of any technology should contain, in fact, information description of the subject area,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
in which business processes work.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Therefore, in this scheme, we have highlighted layers of information technologies, processes, procedures and operations.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Let's repeat again.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
In the vertical curved line on the left, on the slide, processes and procedures are separated,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
working with information streams, in which some semantic meaning prevails.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
That is, information is converted into data.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Or vice versa.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
In the center, working with data, the system of procedures and operations.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And on the right, we again have information and knowledge, in which again the semantic aspect of information prevails.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
If we consistently build a chain consisting of processes and procedures,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
then we will get a description of the process of information conversion to some final information product,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
which can be some kind of documented management solution.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
That is, the initial process is the process of obtaining,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and it begins with the collection procedure, displaying the subject area,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
for example, parameters, characteristics, the state of the control object.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Further, the collected information must be prepared in the appropriate way,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that is, it must be analyzed, structured, checked for completeness, reliability, integrity, and so on.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
After the preparation and verification stages,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
the information can be transmitted via communication channels in some traditional ways,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000
such as telephone, courier, mail, telegraph, or with the help of information and communication technologies,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
for the purpose of conversion, or, perhaps, the conversion algorithm can be immediately turned into data,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
in the process of, so-called, information input.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
This stage converts information into data in the form of digital codes,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
with the help of which this stage of input converts information into data in the form of digital codes,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
with the help of some specific physical phenomena.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
It is important to note that at these stages of the formation of information procedures,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
we usually deal with information that we can comprehend.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.000
After the input, we already deal with data that can be processed,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
that is, converted, accumulated, or exchanged.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The data processing process is associated with the main algorithms and computer calculations procedures.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The exchange involves the transfer of data between all the processes that it is associated with at the level of data.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The exchange also allows the transfer of data between users,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is used in the process of obtaining and displaying information,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and also contributes to the process of accumulation of information coming from different sources.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The main procedures of the exchange are the procedures of switching, routing, and transfer of data,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
which involves the presence of such operations as coding, decoding, modulation, demodulation,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
coordination, and signal amplification, and so on.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000
The accumulation also allows you to convert data and store it for a long time,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
periodically updating, as well as extracting it in the right amount at the request of users.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
The accumulation usually involves the procedures of archiving, updating, searching, and updating data.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The last operation is updating, adding other data to the data,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
correcting old data, or destroying it.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Next, we have the display.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
This procedure contains such procedures as converting data into a form that is convenient for perception,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
either in sound, text, or image, and so on.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The process of knowledge formation usually involves human activity.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000
In fact, we are dealing with the product of human thinking.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
However, so-called expert systems are being created,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
which allow or help or prompt a person

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
how to form knowledge without consulting the services of specialists.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Based on their algorithms,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000
they can form and display certain types of knowledge.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
In fact, IT technology can help solve difficult-to-formalize tasks

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
by automatizing the process of presenting knowledge.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
This is clearly shown in expert systems.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The logical level of IT systems is a complex of interconnected models

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that formalize IT processes when data is transformed.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
This is also shown on the slide.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It is also divided into a model of information display,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
a model of data exchange, data processing, data accumulation,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
a model of data acquisition, and a model of knowledge presentation.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Formalization in the form of models allows to connect the parameters of IT processes

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
and allows to implement IT processes and procedures.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
The logical model of IT reflects the scheme of interconnection of IT processes.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
When processing data, all the main information processes are formed.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Processing, exchange, accumulation of data, and knowledge presentation.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
What is the data processing model?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The first is a formalized description of the processes of the organization of the processing.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
In fact, it is what we have to do with operating systems.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The second is the transformation procedures,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
algorithms, programs, sorting, search, creation, update of some static or dynamic structures.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And the third is the procedures of logical inference or modeling.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The data exchange model contains a formal description of the procedures of the computing network,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
that is, transfer, encoding, modulation in the channels of communication,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
commutation and routing from the protocol of the network exchange.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The data collection model is usually described using international standards,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
OSI, that is, in the interaction of open systems or local networks,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
as well as the specifications of the Internet network.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
The data accumulation model describes the system of data database management,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
as well as the information database itself,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
which can be defined as a database or a database of knowledge.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The process of transition from the sensual, that is, information presentation to the physical,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
is carried out by a three-level information database model system.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That is, from the conceptual one, which in what volume of information should be accumulated

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
when implementing information technology,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
logical, that is, the structure, self-connection of elements and information,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and physical, that is, methods of data placement, access to them on machine carriers.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Next, let's consider the knowledge presentation model,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
which is chosen depending on the completeness, reproduction and content of the target area,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
as well as the types of solvable tasks.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
At present, such knowledge presentation models are used as logical, algorithmic, semantic,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
frame, integral.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
The data collection model is built on the basis of standards

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
that recommend the structure of data and documents, as well as the data formats.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Finally, the information display model is built on the basis of various machine graphics formats

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and any other user graphical interface.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
In fact, this is an interface model,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
that is, how we interact with other parts of information technology, information systems.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Since the basic information processes operate with information, data and knowledge,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
the management takes place through the processes of obtaining,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
collection, preparation, input and display,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
construction of graphics, text, video, synthesis of speech.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Data management is carried out through the processing process,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
that is, in fact, the management of the organization of processing processes and transformation of information,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
as well as through the process of exchange,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
routing and accumulation, that is, systems and databases.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Knowledge management is carried out through the system of management, obtaining and generating knowledge.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Next, let's consider the physical level of information technology description.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
At the physical level, the description of information technology and systems

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
is a software implementation.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
That is, the sub-system includes the sub-system of obtaining and displaying information and presenting knowledge,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
the sub-system of processing, the sub-system of data management and knowledge,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
the sub-system of data accumulation and the sub-system of data exchange.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The slides show how the user and the developer work.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
At the physical level, IT technologies are considered as a system consisting of large subsystems.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Processing, exchange, data accumulation, obtaining and displaying information,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
presenting knowledge and data management and knowledge.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Let's take a closer look at what the data processing subsystems are.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
They are built on the basis of different classes of computing systems

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
and differ in power and performance.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Depending on the needs of the solved tasks,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
large universal hardware computing systems can be used,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
such as mainframes, which are designed for processing large amounts of information.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
If some small amount of information is processed,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
then such software computing systems as personal computers or PCs can be used for this.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Both servers and clients, i.e. workstations, are used in the network.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The data exchange subsystem includes programs and devices,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
i.e. modems, amplifiers, commutators, cables, etc.,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
which create a computing network and perform commutation,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
routing and access to networks.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Data accumulation subsystems are implemented using banks and databases

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
on external devices of the computer that manages them.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It is possible to organize both local databases,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
which are implemented on individual computers,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and distributed databases,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
which are used in the network and distributed data processing.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
The information display and knowledge presentation subsystem

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
is used to form models of the subject area

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
from its fragments and models of the solved tasks.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
At the design stage, the developer usually forms a complex of models of the solved tasks in the memory of the computer.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000
At the operation stage, the user turns to the information display and knowledge presentation subsystem,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000
and, based on the task set, chooses the appropriate solution model,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
after which other subsystems are included through the data management system.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Finally, the data and knowledge management subsystem.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
As a rule, it is partially implemented on the same computers,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
that is, on one computer,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
on which all other subsystems are implemented,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and partially can be implemented using the systems of organization of the processing process

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
or using the databases management system.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
With large flows of information, special services are created,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
the so-called network administrators of databases.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Let's consider the composition and classification of corporate information systems.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Let's turn to the next slide,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
which shows the composition of the integrated corporate information system.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Usually, functional and providing subsystems stand out.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Functional subsystems,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
corporate information systems or KISS,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
informatively serve certain types of economic activities,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
that is, enterprises that are characteristic of its structural divisions or functions of management.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
For example, accounting, accounting, analysis, economic activities, technical preparation, planning, etc.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The integration of functional subsystems into a single system is achieved

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
by creating and functioning providing subsystems,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000
such as information, mathematical, organizational, legal, technical, personnel and other subsystems.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The functional structure of KISS is a complex of economic tasks

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
with a high degree of information exchanges, that is, connections between these tasks.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
The next slide shows some of these tasks,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
depending on the level of management.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
For example, marketing at the strategic level is some new products and services,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
research and development.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
At the tactical level, it is analysis and planning of sales volumes.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
At the operational level, it is processing of customer orders,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
issuing of accounts, deposits, etc.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
The composition of functional subsystems is largely determined by the features of the economic system,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000
its business property, forms of ownership, sizes and character of the enterprise or company.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Functional subsystems are allocated for the implementation of the functions of management,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
such as forecasting, norming, planning,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
accounting and analysis, regulation, which is implemented at various levels of management

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and are combined into relevant management contours, such as marketing, production, logistics, finance.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The subject structure of KISS is a subsystem of management of enterprise resources,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that is, technical preparation of production, main and auxiliary production,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
quality of production, logistics, marketing, personnel.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Functional subsystems cover all types of economic activities or business processes of the enterprise,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
that is, production, supply, supply, personnel, finance.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Subject subsystems are mainly related to the operational level of management.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
As for the supporting subsystems of the corporate information system,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
they practically do not depend on the subject area and have their own specific functional structure,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
namely, information, mathematical, technical, organizational, personnel and other support.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
At the stage of development of the corporate information system,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:57.000
such supporting subsystems as legal, linguistic, technological and methodological support are attracted.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000
The slide shows what supporting systems of the corporate information system are.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
That is, the object of management is the information system itself,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
and the functional structure is information support, mathematical, technical, organizational and personnel.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
What is it? Let's briefly go through them.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Information support is a set of means and methods of building an information base.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It consists of information arrays, structured data, documents, incoming, intermediate, outgoing,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
as well as rules and methods of subject area classification, coding,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
that is, from normative and verification documentation, operational information, some methodological materials.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Mathematical support consists mainly of algorithmic support,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that is, models and algorithms, as well as software support,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
that is, what operating systems, what application software is used, and so on.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Technical support is, in fact, computing technology, peripheral devices,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
network communications, org technology and some communication tools.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Personnel support is training personnel,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
it is methodology, it is a program of courses necessary to maintain the capabilities

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and development of the corporate information system.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Organizational support is a set of means and methods of organization, production, management

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
at the stage of implementation of the corporate information system.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
That is, only when we implement KIS.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
This includes some industry-leading methodological materials,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
typical solutions, design documentation, typical application packages,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
general system or industry classifiers, technical and economic tasks and reasons,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
technical work projects, regular schedules, and so on.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Legal support is related to the regulation of the creation and operation of the corporate information system.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
For example, the regulation of information that is part of the commercial secret.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Each KIS and each enterprise may have its own specific features.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Linguistic support is a set of language tools for successful interaction of various KIS subsystems.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
That is, the languages of the sub-BD, the application software, the rules of formalization of the natural language

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
for compression or disclosure of text information, and so on.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Finally, technological support is a variety of subsystems for processing various types of information

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:36.000
at the stages of their appearance in the life or activity of the corporate information system.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
The most interesting for the manager are three information processing systems in KIS.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
This is the so-called OLTP, online transaction processing,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000
in which the corporate information system works with small transactions,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
but with a fast-flowing flow, and the client needs the system to respond as quickly as possible.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
The analysis should be instantaneous.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
An example is the registration of visits to the website.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
It is so automated that we do not notice how it happens.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Or the automation of the accounting, storage account, or the account of documents.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
All this is done on a flow.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The second type of information processing system, which can also be involved in corporate information systems,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
is OLAP, online analytic processing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
This requires a little more time.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.000
This is the analytical processing in real time, or the technology of analytical processing of information,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the essence of which is in the composition of reports and documents, as well as their dynamic publication.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.000
It is usually used by analysts to carry out complex queries on the basis of data,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
to prepare business accounts for sales, marketing, and so on.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
The third type of information processing system, which is most common in KIS,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:20.000
is the intellectual analysis of data, or data mining, as it is called in the slang of IT specialists.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
This is a process of automatic search for patterns,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
that is, the detection of some hidden patterns,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.000
or the interconnection between variables in large arrays of information and data.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It is also used by analysts in the tasks of classification, modeling, and forecasting.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000
For management practice, the hierarchical distribution of information subsystems by level of management is of significant importance.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
This is reflected in the following slides.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
In the hierarchy of IT management, we have strategic systems at the top level,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
then analytical systems,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
then decision-making support systems,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
then operational management systems,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
automation of business and communications,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:13.000
and finally, dialogue processing of requests or information infrastructure.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
In the level of processing information in corporate information systems,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
we distinguish the following IT processes.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
That is, the level of processing, which we have considered,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
strategic, analytical, decision-making systems, and so on.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
We have, let's say, at the strategic level, the input of some aggregate data,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
processing, it can be analysis, decision-making, modeling,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
and the output may be a solution, strategy, plans.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
As a rule, the top management works at the strategic level.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
At the analytical level, it is analysts and IT professionals.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
The decision-making support system is at the middle level,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
where the input is usually used poorly formalized data, analytical models,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
but alternative modeling and processing take place,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
which are then issued in some reports and analysis results,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and secondary systems are provided above.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It is the complete mixture of such subsystems in corporate information systems

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:27.000
thatè® Ñ requirements of specialized IT systems centrally affect the function of IT.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000
The completion of such subsystems allows to specialize relevant subsystems

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
that play a significant role in the functioning of the KIS.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It is the data processing systems that work with iterative processes of processing information

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
and require very fast processing processes.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Next, information management systems that are oriented at the tactical level of management

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
from a week to a month.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And finally, third specialized system is the decision-making support systems

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
that serve the strategic level of management and are associated with the life cycle of the entire corporate information system.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
That is, if the corporate information system starts to be poorly indicated,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.000
to form a decision-making badly, its life cycle ends.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000
It should be noted that the attempts to classify corporate information systems

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
are quite conditional and are associated with the fact that the determining properties and parameters

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
of any information system depend on each other.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
In fact, from any small information system, we can create an integrated large system

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
that covers the entire enterprise.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:56.000
This is evidenced by the development of the history of the business of such companies as HP, Oracle,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
SAP, Russian 1S, which began with the automation of accounting,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and now they are already bringing their products to the corporate level and are associated with ERP systems.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Classification from the textbook of Trofimov, dedicated to information technologies in the economy,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:27.000
can be taken as a basis and used as a guide for choosing from an impressive amount of IT products and solutions

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.000
accumulated by the business for some practical meaning and for the practice of management.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000
According to this textbook, IT is classified in the sphere of operations of the management object,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
i.e. industrial enterprises, education, social sphere, banking, credit organizations.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Further, it is a functional classification of the functional structure of information systems,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.000
i.e. automation of technical preparation of production, marketing, enterprise development strategy,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
economic planning, finance, material and technical supply, management of personnel, and others.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:14.000
In terms of organizational structure, IT systems can be distinguished from those systems

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
that are focused on one automated workplace of the management personnel,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000
as well as on complexes of interconnected ERPs, i.e. automated workplaces.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Information systems are divided by borders into information systems of enterprises, organizations, industries,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:39.000
state, and even international information systems, such as the international system of transfers, SWIFT,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
which is used by all banks.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:51.000
In terms of integration, IT systems are classified as local, i.e. the use of isolated information space,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
partially integrated information systems, i.e. which have some common information space,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and a fully integrated cooperative information system.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:11.000
In terms of IT architecture, IT systems are divided into IT systems with centralized architecture and construction,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000
i.e. one data storage and processing center, or IT systems with distributed architecture,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
i.e. computer networks and the presence of many data processing and storage centers.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:34.000
In terms of specialization, IT systems are classified as IT systems for organizational and economic management,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:41.000
IT systems for automated training, i.e. e-learning system,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:47.000
automated management systems of organization resources, i.e. MRP and RP systems,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
automated systems for the technological processes of production of products, i.e. ASUTP,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000
as well as specialized systems such as SAPR, automated design systems for design,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
production technology and other products.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Finally, let's consider the last important element of corporate information systems,

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
i.e. the lifecycle of information systems, i.e. the process of creating an information system,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.000
which is described using the following concepts, i.e. the lifecycle itself, phases, stages, stages,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
stages, processes, operations and elements.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:34.000
The main phases of the lifecycle of any corporate system are the phase of invention, development,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
operation and dismantling.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
The most important phases are the phase of invention and development,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
which are built from the following five stages, as a rule,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000
i.e. the formation of requirements, development of concepts, technical tasks, technical project and implementation.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
The methodology of creating information systems is reflected in the normative documents,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
the majority of which have the power of international standards.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Terminology, order, creation and implementation of requirements for parts,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
the composition of projects.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.000
The sequence of works related to the determination of the purposefulness of creation and industrial operation of an information system

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
is defined in the form of a process, i.e. creation or manufacture,

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:32.000
which has a hierarchical description and consists of stages, each of which includes stages,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and they are, in turn, types of work.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
That is, such a matryoshka is obtained.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
As a fragment, we will consider in more detail the content of the process of creation and implementation of a corporate information system,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
which includes the following stages, stages and some types of work.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
The stage of forming requirements and development of concepts.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:03.000
The main purpose of the stages and work of these stages is to form a proposal based on the position of the customer

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and to propose the creation of a corporate information system with certain basic functions and technical characteristics.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That is, what functionality is required for a particular customer and what should be the technical basis for this functionality.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
The main output documents of this stage are reports and technical and economic justification,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
the purposefulness of creating a corporate information system with selected functions and characteristics,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:36.000
as well as applications for the creation of KIS and the initial technical requirements for a corporate information system

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
in the corresponding volume, usually to the state.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Further, the stages of technical task and sketch design.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:53.000
The main purpose of these stages is to confirm the purposefulness and detailed examination of the possibility

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:00.000
of creating an effective information system with functions and technical characteristics

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
formulated in the form of initial technical requirements for the system.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000
That is, what is the overall planning of all scientific and technical works,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
design and construction works, project installation and installation works,

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
and the deadlines for their execution, the organization of the executors,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
the preparation of all the materials necessary for the project work.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000
The output documents at this stage are the technical task for the creation of an information system

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
containing technical requirements and a work schedule plan,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
which is agreed upon with the customer and the main executor,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
which will be used to implement the corporate information system,

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000
as well as clarification of economic justification and some solutions planned in the technical task,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
if necessary.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
A scientific and technical report containing the results of pre-project studies

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
or some kind of sketch project of the information system is also possible.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Further, the stage of technical projects.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The purpose of the work carried out at this stage is to develop the basic technical solutions

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
for the system being created and to finally determine the cost.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
The work of this stage is completed by the development of some general system solutions

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
necessary and sufficient for the release of operational documentation for the system as a whole,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
that is, the project of the death documentation.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Also, at this stage, we have, as a rule, a project of applications for the development of some new technical means.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000
At this stage, the documentation of special mathematical and technical support is being developed,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
including technical tasks for programming.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000
That is, at this stage, requirements for programmers are being formed.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:00.000
The main result of the work is the design of a technical project for the corporate information system.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
The work documentation is the next stage.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:10.000
The purpose of the work carried out at this stage is to release the work documentation for the system being created.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
The stage is completed by the release of the information system project consisting of the project documentation

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:24.000
necessary and sufficient for the purchase, installation and installation of some sets of hardware and technical means of the system,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:32.000
as well as the documentation of the program and organizational support necessary and sufficient for the operation of the system as a whole.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And finally, the stage of implementation.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The purpose of this stage and the main result, in fact, is to transfer the operating system into industrial operation,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000
as well as to obtain some objective, systematized data on the quality of the system,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:54.000
its current state and the real effect of the system based on the experience of its industrial operation.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000
For this, the performance of the system as a whole and its individual elements are determined.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
The performance of the system as a whole is determined by the technical and economic efficiency of the system,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000
the functional and algorithmic completeness of the system,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and the social and psychological comfort for the personnel operating the corporate information system.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So, we have considered both information technology and information systems from the stage of creation to the full life cycle,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
that is, to the stage of dismantling.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Let's sum up some of the results of the second lecture.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000
The first thing to pay attention to is that any modern corporate information system includes as components

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:53.000
a set of other specialized information systems designed for certain purposes.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
For example, automation of the production process, support for decision-making,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
the formation of knowledge of the operating system, and so on.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
The second thing is that today information technology is more and more associated with some kind of final set of decisions

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
on the automation of business processes,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000
and information systems are more associated with some kind of set of products for the optimization of business processes

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
and their strategic development.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
The third thing to pay attention to is that one of the most important aspects,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
which is often omitted from the view of managers when deciding to introduce a particular corporate information system,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
is the humiliation of the role of the human factor in favor of the development of some kind of technocratic.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000
No matter how perfect the software provided by the company or manager,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:50.000
or how powerful the hardware device or hardware part of the technology may look,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:58.000
they all have zero value if they are not owned by specialists, employees, that is, staff.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000
There is an idiom, if you bought something, then you own it.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
But if you did not own it, then you do not have it.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
This is the situation characteristic of most Russian enterprises,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:22.000
in which 80% of IT services are aimed at maintaining the resources of computing complexes and software,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:31.000
while abroad this figure, according to our agency S-News, is only 40%.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
That is, the main foreign IT services are not aimed at technology and software,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
but at training staff, working with clients, consulting, and so on.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Another moment of truth is laid in the computing complexes themselves.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
If you remember the Moore's law, which we talked about at the beginning,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
then the voices of experts and specialists are heard more and more often

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
related to the issue of the ecology of computing.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000
This increases the concentration of computing power on the decreasing area of the microprocessor.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000
That is, the density of energy in chips turns them into a small semblance of a nuclear system.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.000
That is, by increasing some software characteristics, we violate other ecological ones.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
It is no coincidence that one of the significant characteristics of the so-called data processing centers,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
that is, the CODs, is not so much the maintenance of stable energy consumption,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
but the amount of energy consumed per unit of computing.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Therefore, in one concept, hardware, software, human, ecological, and other factors can be combined

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
only under the aegis of some theoretical knowledge, a construct, a concept,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:01.000
which will help to optimize the use of resources and will allow to achieve business goals in an effective way.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:08.000
The fifth point is the conditional classification and the difficulties of using the concept of IT systems and IT technology

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
are due to the nature of the concept of information.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:18.000
If the information is considered in the context of the process as a whole, then it corresponds more to IT technology.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:26.000
If the information is considered as an object localized and circulating along the contour of some system,

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
then the concept of IT system is more suitable here.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So, in the most general form, for a NUSH manager, the IT system is a product of theoretical knowledge

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.000
implemented in human, hardware, software, and other resources and technologies,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.000
which allows him to make the optimal choice of solutions for business goals.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.000
IT products allow the manager to cope with the ever-increasing flow of information,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
understand and classify his subject area of ââactivity,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
extract knowledge and competence from it for the purposes of business processes, and finally just become wiser.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Such a concept of IT technology and IT systems will be useful from another point of view,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:20.000
namely, today there is a boom in the development of various IT systems and IT technologies.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And it is very difficult to understand their differences, to understand the value for business today.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000
And since for a certain category of IT specialists and businessmen,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000
that is, consultants, experts, vendors, distributors, and other IT systems,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
IT systems are a source of income,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:48.000
it is sometimes difficult to determine where the purposefulness of the implementation of a corporate IT system ends for some

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
and where the marketing of the product for others begins.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Be extremely careful and careful in this.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:03.000
So, let's illustrate our rather boring, dry lecture based on GOST information,

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
that is, GOST-based business cases,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
related to the activities of the Nevsky Design Bureau.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I liked it because here the data movement on procedures, operations, processes

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:26.000
based on the activities of this enterprise, this bureau, is considered as some kind of through-business processes.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That is, the movement of data, information, for them, is a through-business process.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Therefore, at the enterprise, the most complete, in my opinion, is the task of moving data

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000
both horizontally, that is, between units, and vertically, from the executive to the management and back.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
So, the Nevsky Design Bureau, it has existed for about 70 years,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:54.000
this is our main enterprise for designing, providing documentation, construction, repair, equipment,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000
re-equipment of our large and complex ocean-based ships.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
The information systems used here are the Oracle database information system,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:13.000
then the CAD design system, based on which a corporate system called Tronics was created.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.000
This is a corporate system of the so-called PLM class,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
which provides ERP, CAD, PDM modules and functions.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
What is PLM, CAD and PDM?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
PLM and CAD can be called from the glossary of the course.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:38.000
These abbreviations are associated with the life support of both the product and the entire system as a whole.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
The main product of the PCB is the design and documentation project,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
the overwhelming part of which is text information.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
The drawings take up only 30%.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
The technology with text documents is integrated with the design technology of the drawing schedule.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The release of all text design documentation,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
that is, management of production, accounting, control,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
even the definition of standards, labor capacity, design work,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:11.000
all this is connected with the drawing and is managed with the help of the corporate information system Tronics.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000
A single database contains calculations, electronic originals, real documents,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and control copies with all changes that came from the customer's factory.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Thus, each document exists in four types.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
These are the original data for creation,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
then it is like the original, that is, a digital model,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
then in the form of a genuine, printed and certified signature,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
scanned drawing, which usually goes to the archive,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and some copies with corrected versions.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
All project information is stored in a single database,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000
in accordance with the rights of access to all executors from any workplace.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
In fact, the task of creating a single information space has been solved,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.000
so that the data is not only used in the PCB by all departments,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
but also transmitted directly to the customer's factory,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
and in the future used directly on some onboard systems,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
for example, ships, and to ensure its operation.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
The Bureau departments do not just communicate with each other,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
exchange information, but work in a single information space,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
that is, with a single model of the object.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And the bosses have a transparent picture of everything that is happening.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Data exchange is also imposed,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
and an interactive relationship with the partners,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
that is, with the factories that produce the product,

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
on the basis of which projects are made.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
That is, it distributes work, controls for the execution,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
loading of executors, deadlines, reports, and so on.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
And also provides specific functions,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
which are in such PLM systems,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
that is, in Product Life Management.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
That is, let's take a closer look at their role.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
First, integration with design systems is underway.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
That is, if the work is specified as completed,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
its result, drawing or text document,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
can be viewed directly from the KISS

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
in the corporate information system,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
to anyone who is associated with this product, with this drawing.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Secondly, there is group work.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
If the designer needs drawings, for example,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
then he orders them to KISS, and they are delivered to his computer,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
by email.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
That is, in fact, in the system,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
the work is placed as if it were in someone's hands.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Of course, there is an interactive interaction module.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And the third is a module for preparing documentation for export.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Since the customers of PKB are foreign companies,

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000
for which translation into English is necessary.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Reporting and any analytics of any complexity

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
are generated, in fact, in a second.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
There is no duplication of paper information at this enterprise.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And it is very difficult to get analytics just like that,

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000
in the form of paper.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
For many years, no one has come to work with paper documents on PKB.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
The director has his own so-called PC tablet,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
with which he does not part, even on business trips.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And he can directly connect to the network from any place

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and be able to find everything he needs in the corporate information system.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Reports, some analytical notes,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
and any information.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The corporate information system

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
shows how many resources a person has,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
what exactly he asked for to perform certain tasks.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Then you can compare the plan with the fact.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
The area of the created documents is evaluated.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
In fact, the developed area can be compared with the standards.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
The accumulated statistics allows you to set some reasonable standards.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
At the same time, you can track how many specific documents

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
were actually taken from the company.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And how much information was actually taken from the company.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
How many specific executors were actually involved

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
in a particular real object.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That is, what is the real load.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And whether it corresponds to the requested or knocked out by the department head.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
KISS also includes a framework management system,

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
which, among other things,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
contains a work time record,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
according to the sensors installed on the walkway.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And most importantly,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
the fact that the company is informing people on the walkway

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
allows them to implement the so-called sliding work schedule.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Paper documents, of course,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
no one sees them anymore.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And the customer goes to the plant in electronic form.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
The genuine front-end communication channel

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
is the basis for the plant,

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
allowing you to start doing your work.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
The interactive interaction process during group work

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
All participants in the consent,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
discussion of the documentation,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
both at the checkpoint and at the plant,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
have a connection with it through their workplace.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
At the plant, they receive the documentation,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
questions arise,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000
everyone who needs to find out something,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
writes a request and sends it to the electronic mail in a special form.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Specialists from the technical support group

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
either make their own decisions

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
or attract additional resources to solve this issue.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Or they plan an additional project

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
to solve it

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
or to modernize this or that issue.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
At any stage,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
all managers see the statistics

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
and the status of all these tasks,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
questions that go from the customer to the customer.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
All this is recorded in KIS

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
as additional planned work

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
and is tested under strict control.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
This means that the interaction system

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
is integrated with the KIS management system.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Let's focus on some specific work with information in PKB.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Data storage on PC users

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
is strictly prohibited and is prohibited.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
It is limited both on hardware and on software.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
It is understandable,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
because many are tired of working with copies

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
that have already been changed.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
They have a principle

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
that whoever gave birth to data should introduce it.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
The information should be introduced where it is born.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
This is the principle of PKB.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Every employee should introduce his own information

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and this increases the responsibility for this data.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Finally, one of the most important points.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
All the information necessary for other departments

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
or for accounting should be generated

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
and sent to the appropriate application.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
For example, if an engineer designs a scheme,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
he does not need to make a purchase notification for this scheme.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
The application itself

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
should form an additional document

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
that is already in the application

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
and is sent to the procurement department.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
The engineer just indicates what he needs for the scheme,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and the application itself

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
works with what the engineer has chosen

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
and sends it to the material and technical supply department.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
To summarize this business case,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
one of the most important points

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
is that the application itself

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
is not a separate part of the system.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
One of the most important points

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
is that PKB has abandoned the information

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
of the work of individual persons.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
It is important for them to provide information

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
through the business process.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
The KIS should take into account

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
the feedback and generate business processes.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
For example,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
if it is impossible to design ventilation,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
which is not yet known,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
and it usually involves

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
the contribution of air conditioners,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
which produce heat,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
then we need to connect these air conditioners

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
with the ventilation system.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
In fact, it turns out a technological chain,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
the design of which is established,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
that is, it is integrated and automated

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
by a corporate information system.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
It is important that the system has the ability

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
to support such design chains.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
That is, it determines the terms,

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
costs, and quality of such a technical project.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
If the system does everything it can,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
but does not generate such business chains

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
and does not support their solution,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
then its activity does not affect the cost.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
In short, we got acquainted

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
with the business processes

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
and data movements

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
of various units used in the Nevsky PCB.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
We have considered the first part

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
of our course on IT for managers,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
which reflected both the view

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
of the information society

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
and the existing theory,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
and considered in detail

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
what information technology

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
and information systems are.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
As a result, I would highlight several points.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
The most important is that we need to overcome

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
the lack of information.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
The amount of information is not important

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
for us, especially for business,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
but the quality of information.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Moreover, we must understand

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
that with such a technocratic view,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
we are guaranteed an uncontrollable growth

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
of unstructured information.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
It is time to change.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
If we do not take control of the market,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
the situation at the enterprise will deteriorate

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
and they will get stuck in their own information flows.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
They will not be able to understand

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
where the market is, where to develop,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
how to develop and what to do next.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Moreover, we now have a very large zoo

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
of various information technologies

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
and information systems.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Some of them will significantly improve business,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
while others will only interfere.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Therefore, it is important to understand

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
and feel if an enterprise or a manager,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
as the owner of the business process,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
cannot or lacks his own knowledge and competence.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
He must attract consultants

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
or vendors or experts

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
so that they can understand

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
how information systems

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
or information technology

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
can influence the life cycle of his business process.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
This is very important.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I hope that the practical skills

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
you have gained during the two works,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
namely, on the assessment of the enterprise

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
on the subject of creating a knowledge management system

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
and on the assessment of the enterprise

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
on the subject of the knowledge management system

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
and on the assessment of the value of ownership

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
of the park of computer staff,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
will allow you to generate some solutions

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
related to your business

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
and will allow you to reach the level

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
when you make decisions consciously,

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
not under the influence of some advertising

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
or marketing program.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Count only on yourself

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
and be vigilant.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
There is a lot of information

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000
that is empty, baseless,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000
and does not affect the business.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
You need to learn to optimize your business processes

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
based on determining the value of information,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
knowledge and competence.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Remember that at the top of the pyramid

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
of valuable information

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
is the best business practice.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Thank you for your attention.
