00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Hello, dear colleagues.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.280
The stable performance of companies depends on successful implementation of products.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.720
Ultimately, optimally formed sales channels increase the competitive

00:15.720 --> 00:19.920
sustainability of enterprises and are a strategic tool for managing

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
companies.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.360
The success of your company depends on how stable your client base is,

00:25.360 --> 00:28.760
how optimally formed your sales channels are,

00:28.760 --> 00:30.840
and how successful your company is in the market.

00:30.840 --> 00:35.880
In this course, we will consider how to optimally and economically

00:35.880 --> 00:41.600
form a sales channel, find new clients, keep existing ones,

00:41.600 --> 00:45.520
and also consider the specifics of the market and the specifics of your product.

00:45.520 --> 00:50.080
In the first section of the course, we will consider the trends of the market of distribution,

00:50.080 --> 00:53.360
how it develops depending on the market development,

00:53.360 --> 00:56.640
how it is modified and what its specifics are.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.720
In the second section, we will consider the sales development strategies,

01:00.720 --> 01:06.040
where we can see how, depending on the specifics of your product

01:06.040 --> 01:10.360
and your company, to form a sales channel and what sales strategy

01:10.360 --> 01:12.680
to choose for your company.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.480
In the third section, we will consider the technology of the development of the sales network,

01:17.480 --> 01:22.040
where we will consider the methods of finding new clients in the industries and regions,

01:22.040 --> 01:27.360
where we will consider the methods of assessing the economic efficiency of your clients.

01:27.360 --> 01:33.280
Because without an assessment, we simply cannot form an optimal sales network.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.200
In the fourth section of our course, we will consider how to properly

01:38.200 --> 01:41.520
and more accurately form a sales plan of a company,

01:41.520 --> 01:44.640
because this is what determines the implementation of the company's budget

01:44.640 --> 01:47.080
and the optimally formed sales networks.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.000
And, of course, when our sales network is formed,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
the next thing we have to do is to clearly control our sales network

01:55.000 --> 01:57.920
and analyze its effectiveness.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.560
The first thing we will start with in our course

02:05.560 --> 02:09.040
is, of course, the history of the formation of distribution.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.160
Our history of market development has already gone through at least three stages,

02:13.160 --> 02:15.040
and now the fourth one begins.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.960
What three stages have we gone through? Let's take a look.

02:17.960 --> 02:27.400
The first stage, which began in the 1990s, was characterized by the following indicators.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.240
Foreign companies came to our market,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.960
who offered quality inexpensive goods.

02:33.960 --> 02:38.760
And, of course, this product could not compete on the shelves with our domestic manufacturer.

02:38.760 --> 02:45.960
Naturally, companies that represented the interests of foreign companies began to be created here.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.720
The domestic market was simply in decline.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.920
And this situation lasted until 1995.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.600
Another characteristic, the most important for the first stage,

02:57.600 --> 03:00.400
is that the market was unstructured.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.280
There were huge turnovers in the market, and companies were making super profits.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.440
The market allowed this to be done.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.960
But as the market became, as it developed, the situation, of course, became more complicated.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.400
The competition increased, more and more foreign manufacturers came to the market,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.880
and domestic companies began to slowly rise their heads.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.760
At the second stage, strong domestic manufacturers appear,

03:24.760 --> 03:27.800
who work mainly on the FMCG market,

03:27.800 --> 03:31.680
since this market develops the fastest in our Russia.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.200
The expansion of foreign manufacturers is gaining momentum.

03:35.200 --> 03:41.720
Foreign manufacturers begin to enter regions where they create their exclusive representations,

03:41.760 --> 03:45.160
and their distribution system is developing very actively.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.040
The second stage continues until 1998.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.400
1998, as you remember, was characterized by special events.

03:54.400 --> 04:01.000
It was Black Tuesday, when the ruble collapsed and the dollar rate grew very strongly.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.200
At this stage, foreign manufacturers were forced to leave the market,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.360
because their prices simply became uncompetitive.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.160
At this moment, our domestic manufacturers got a kind of a head start,

04:13.160 --> 04:18.240
although it was also difficult for them to survive this crisis, but they stood the strongest.

04:18.240 --> 04:24.120
And just from this moment, a very active development of the domestic manufacturers market begins.

04:24.120 --> 04:29.480
At the third stage, which, in principle, took place just before 2006,

04:29.480 --> 04:33.560
the development of domestic manufacturers was the most active.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.840
This is the pharmaceutical market, the food product market, the consumer goods market.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.400
We see how it is actively developing now.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.760
If we talk about the industrial market, then things are much worse there,

04:45.760 --> 04:52.600
because 70% of industrial equipment is outdated and does not meet the requirements of new technologies.

04:52.600 --> 04:58.280
So far, industrial companies have no funds to make a complete update.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.160
And mostly, the middle business is developing here.

05:02.160 --> 05:08.000
Large and large-scale industries still cannot restore their production.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.080
What is happening in the distribution market?

05:11.080 --> 05:14.520
There is a reduction, and the reduction is very serious.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.440
If at the second stage companies created their distribution system

05:19.440 --> 05:22.800
and created many distributors in different regions,

05:22.800 --> 05:27.560
because it was necessary to get a wide distribution of products,

05:27.560 --> 05:34.080
to get every corner of the Russian Federation, so that this product was presented,

05:34.080 --> 05:37.440
then now the next stage is taking place.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.840
The number of distributors is beginning to decrease,

05:39.840 --> 05:45.080
because it is difficult for companies to control all the distributors that have appeared and that are working.

05:45.080 --> 05:49.640
The best are chosen in each region and an exclusive distribution system is created.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.440
This is what is happening in the market, where foreign manufacturers are leading.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.960
Russian manufacturers are still actively developing their distribution system.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.040
And just as everything was with foreign manufacturers at the second stage,

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
now we are on the same path.

06:07.040 --> 06:12.400
Another trend that characterizes the third stage is the formation of a network retail.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.960
We see how the network retail is formed in our market.

06:15.960 --> 06:23.520
If you pay attention to the slide, you will see that the growth in retail sales through the network has increased 10 times,

06:23.520 --> 06:27.720
starting only in 1999.

06:28.040 --> 06:35.080
And given that in the foreign market the retail retail takes up from 60 to 80%,

06:35.080 --> 06:37.960
and in our market it takes up 24-25%,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.760
we see that there is a very large trend for growth,

06:40.760 --> 06:44.280
and this trend will prevail over the next few years.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.520
How do manufacturers react to the current situation?

06:48.520 --> 06:53.320
The first thing they do, of course, is to reduce the number of distributors.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.880
They have gone this way.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.440
Let's look at some examples.

06:57.440 --> 07:02.600
The Saninterbryu company had 430 distributors in the Russian Federation.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.720
Today, it has reduced them to only 12.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.000
This allows you to strictly control the distribution system,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.560
control the efficiency of the sales channels,

07:11.560 --> 07:16.960
and not spend money and other resources in vain.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.080
The Achakov company, with 300 distributors,

07:20.080 --> 07:23.120
reduced its distribution system to only 6.

07:23.160 --> 07:27.000
The next response from distributors is to create their own system.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.840
For example, the Kalina company refuses to use regional warehouses

07:30.840 --> 07:32.760
and creates its own dealer system.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.360
Other companies, such as Pecor, Procter & Gamble,

07:36.360 --> 07:39.680
also create their own distributor system.

07:39.680 --> 07:44.840
Another important trend is the creation of key accounts,

07:44.840 --> 07:47.600
the creation of direct retail departments.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.400
Why is this happening?

07:49.520 --> 07:53.440
Because we cannot give such an important part of the work

07:53.440 --> 07:55.480
as working with a retail network for a refund.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.000
There is a strict control,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.480
strict control of supplies, merchandising,

07:59.480 --> 08:01.800
payments, price education.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.480
And, of course, large companies do this on their own,

08:05.480 --> 08:07.960
creating their own departments.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.480
And all the rest of the work on wholesale channels

08:10.480 --> 08:13.240
they transfer to their distributors.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.840
So, let's summarize some logical conclusions

08:15.840 --> 08:19.120
of the trend of the distribution market development.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.360
And its near future.

08:21.360 --> 08:27.040
Today, there is a gradual advent of foreign distributors

08:27.040 --> 08:28.920
in the Russian market,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.640
who implement a well-established service system,

08:32.640 --> 08:34.920
which is very important for the Russian market,

08:34.920 --> 08:38.640
because the service in the Russian market is still far from perfection.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.440
The next trend is the import of production to developing countries.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.960
Many companies, even Russian manufacturers,

08:45.960 --> 08:50.960
have seen the efficiency of production in China or the CIS countries,

08:50.960 --> 08:54.120
because production there is much cheaper

08:54.120 --> 08:56.440
and profitability is much higher.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.440
The crisis of industrial enterprises, unfortunately, continues.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.440
Today, outdated equipment and high cost of production

09:03.440 --> 09:07.440
do not allow companies to produce competitive goods.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.760
The next trend is the re-dealing of ownership

09:09.760 --> 09:12.240
in the most actively developing markets.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.440
What markets can be cited as an example?

09:15.440 --> 09:17.440
This is the telecommunications market,

09:17.440 --> 09:21.440
the raw materials market, the banking market,

09:21.440 --> 09:26.440
and probably others, which are most actively developing now.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.440
Unfortunately, such a trend exists.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.440
Another tendency is the active development of the middle business.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.440
Despite the fact that the state does not actively support the development of the middle business,

09:38.440 --> 09:42.440
nevertheless, the companies that received the forum in 1998

09:42.440 --> 09:48.440
continue to feel stable, active and develop further.

09:48.440 --> 09:54.440
Another tendency that I would like to note is the introduction of innovation in various companies.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.440
Moreover, innovations at completely different levels.

09:57.440 --> 10:02.440
Innovations in the management system, innovations in the assortment portfolio,

10:02.440 --> 10:05.440
and, of course, innovations in the distribution system.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.440
Many companies try, and by trial and error,

10:08.440 --> 10:12.440
choose the most effective ways of distributing their products.

10:28.440 --> 10:32.440
We will start considering the development of the strategy from the household network from the very beginning,

10:32.440 --> 10:34.440
that is, from the life cycle of the product.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.440
Why the life cycle of the product?

10:36.440 --> 10:42.440
Because the strategy of sales, which you will develop and form, and then optimize,

10:42.440 --> 10:50.440
depends on what product you sell, new or already released on the market.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.440
What is the life cycle of the product?

10:53.440 --> 10:58.440
This is a conceptual model that shows that the product, like everything alive on this earth,

10:58.440 --> 11:02.440
grows, enters the stage of maturity, and then dies.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.440
The slide shows all the life cycles of the product.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.440
There are four of them, but here we have divided them into five,

11:10.440 --> 11:18.440
because each cycle has its own stage of development and its own formation from the household network.

11:18.440 --> 11:22.440
The first stage is the introduction, when the product is just being developed

11:22.440 --> 11:26.440
and goes to the market as an experimental sample of the product.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.440
The next stage is growth, when the active growth of the market begins,

11:30.440 --> 11:34.440
and there, accordingly, their laws of development come into force.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.440
The next stage is turbulence.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.440
It is highlighted, unlike the classic model.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.440
Why is it highlighted?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.440
The stage of turbulence has its own specifics.

11:44.440 --> 11:49.440
The fact is that at this stage, the active growth of the market ends,

11:49.440 --> 11:52.440
and the most tough competition occurs.

11:52.440 --> 11:59.440
Here, in order to withstand and survive the company, you need to be very active.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.440
The next stage is maturity, when the product is sold steadily,

12:03.440 --> 12:09.440
when everyone knows it, but, of course, the profitability on this product decreases.

12:09.440 --> 12:15.440
Nevertheless, the household network is already formed, and the product is sold steadily.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.440
And the stage of decline, when the product is morally outdated,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.440
or technically outdated, or new developments appear.

12:21.440 --> 12:26.440
At this stage, the product is sold out, and, of course, the household network also changes.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.440
Let's take a closer look at each stage.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.440
The first stage is implementation.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.440
Let's consider it from the point of view of three aspects.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.440
From the point of view of the macro environment, from the point of view of the strategic goals of the company,

12:38.440 --> 12:40.440
and from the point of view of the marketing program,

12:40.440 --> 12:45.440
which must be carried out at this stage of product development.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.440
What is characterized by the macro environment?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.440
Very slow growth of the primary demand.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.440
No one knows about your product yet.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.440
It is just coming to the market.

12:54.440 --> 13:01.440
Therefore, of course, we cannot demand from the market when only innovators know the product.

13:01.440 --> 13:07.440
Those people who make up only 2% of the total number of consumers or your clients.

13:07.440 --> 13:12.440
Therefore, here, of course, our goal is to capture the segment of innovators,

13:12.440 --> 13:15.440
tell them about our product, offer them our product.

13:15.440 --> 13:20.440
At this stage, there are practically no competitors, and the company is either a monopolist,

13:20.440 --> 13:26.440
if this is a know-how, of course, if this is not a know-how, but just an improved type of existing product.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.440
Then, of course, there are competitors, but maybe they have not yet released a product with such characteristics

13:31.440 --> 13:33.440
that you offer on the market.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.440
Strategic goals of the company.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.440
What goals are the company pursuing at this stage?

13:38.440 --> 13:42.440
The first, of course, is to create demand in order for our product to be recognized

13:42.440 --> 13:47.440
and in order for it to be bought at least for the first time and tried to be used.

13:47.440 --> 13:54.440
At this stage, we need to inform our clients and teach them to use our product

13:54.440 --> 14:03.440
so that they can do it comfortably and so that the impression of our product is the most positive, the most attractive.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.440
Therefore, another goal is to stimulate trial purchases.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.440
After all, if no one tries our product, then, accordingly, no one will buy it.

14:10.440 --> 14:15.440
Well, and, of course, at this stage, one of the main goals is to form a home network.

14:15.440 --> 14:21.440
Because if we do not do it and do not form it, we simply will not have a place to offer our product.

14:21.440 --> 14:27.440
From the point of view of the marketing program, what goals and tasks do we set for ourselves here?

14:27.440 --> 14:30.440
Well, the first is regarding the product.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.440
We sell, of course, the basic model that we have just developed.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.440
What is the best sales strategy at this stage?

14:38.440 --> 14:42.440
Is it exclusive sales or selective sales?

14:43.440 --> 14:49.440
Exclusive sales is sales through one intermediary in a given region or territory.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.440
Selective sales is through a limited number of intermediaries.

14:52.440 --> 14:57.440
We will come back to this and consider more details about the sales strategy.

14:57.440 --> 15:02.440
Why is only selective or exclusive sales needed at this stage?

15:02.440 --> 15:11.440
The fact is that you need to look for companies and specialists who can competently and correctly present your product to the market.

15:11.440 --> 15:18.440
If they do it wrong or do it wrong, your product will not be accepted by the market

15:18.440 --> 15:23.440
and, accordingly, will not be sold in the volumes that you have planned.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.440
The price. What do we do with our price here?

15:26.440 --> 15:29.440
Here we can apply the strategy of removing the creams.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.440
Is your product a know-how or some kind of exclusive?

15:32.440 --> 15:40.440
Well, for example, your product is a software that all companies need to use.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.440
Then you can set any price.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.440
Companies will not go anywhere, they will be forced to buy your product.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.440
You can easily earn money on this.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.440
You can also bring real estate to the market.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.440
The next price strategy is the strategy of expanding the market.

15:57.440 --> 16:05.440
At this stage, you can apply the strategy if your product is an improved copy of an existing product

16:05.440 --> 16:09.440
or has some additional functions that are, of course, necessary for the consumer.

16:09.440 --> 16:17.440
Due to the fact that you set a small price on the market, the product is quickly distributed.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.440
It is tried by a larger number of consumers.

16:20.440 --> 16:28.440
And such a strategy is applicable if the cost of the product decreases with the increase in production.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.440
Then it is profitable.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
What do we do with communications?

16:31.440 --> 16:34.440
Communication, of course, is the information of our clients.

16:34.440 --> 16:40.440
If we do not tell them about our product, they may not recognize it and, accordingly, not buy it.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.440
The next stage is the growth stage.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.440
What is the characteristic of the macro-environment at the growth stage?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.440
Increasing the pace of market development.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.440
The most active growth of the market takes place at this stage.

16:53.440 --> 16:57.440
New competitors appear here, their number increases.

16:57.440 --> 17:02.440
Because other companies saw your success and decided to repeat it.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
This happens in all markets.

17:04.440 --> 17:10.440
And here the goal from the point of view of consumers is a segment of the so-called early perception,

17:10.440 --> 17:15.440
which is about 17% of all buyers, of all customers.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.440
What else is characterized by the macro-environment?

17:18.440 --> 17:21.440
Of course, the spread of your technology.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.440
At first you were the first, and now your competitors are starting to use this technology

17:27.440 --> 17:30.440
and apply it in their production and distribution.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.440
What strategic goals does the company set for itself at this stage?

17:34.440 --> 17:38.440
Increasing the primary demand.

17:38.440 --> 17:44.440
The market is growing and our task is to capture as many customers as possible,

17:44.440 --> 17:48.440
because competitors now also claim their wallet.

17:48.440 --> 17:52.440
The next goal is to create the image of the company or the trading brand.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.440
Here, as you decide, if you have industrial products,

17:55.440 --> 17:59.440
it may be more purposeful to create the image of the company.

17:59.440 --> 18:08.440
And if you produce or sell products related to the goods of the popular consumption or the FMCG market,

18:08.440 --> 18:14.440
then the trading brand will certainly play a positive role in the development of this product.

18:14.440 --> 18:19.440
Two more goals that characterize this stage are increasing the market cap,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.440
because we need to increase our distribution system.

18:24.440 --> 18:29.440
We no longer care about the selective or exclusive sales of the strategy

18:29.440 --> 18:32.440
that we used at the first stage of our development.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.440
This system does not have time to sell our product.

18:36.440 --> 18:41.440
And here our task is to increase our number of intermediaries, our sales network.

18:41.440 --> 18:47.440
And, of course, creating a loyalty to the product is the next goal that our company should pursue.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.440
Why? Our product should be liked.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.440
If it is not liked, we will not see repeated purchases.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.440
Without repeated purchases, there will be no need for a sales system.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.440
Marketing program. What is it characterized by?

18:59.440 --> 19:03.440
Well, the first thing we look at is, of course, the range.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.440
We start thinking about improving the product.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.440
Some functions may need to be added or slightly change the design,

19:11.440 --> 19:13.440
because competitors are coming to us.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.440
And already at this stage, the company must think about how not to lose the market,

19:17.440 --> 19:21.440
how to improve their product a little.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.440
And this can be done not only in the product itself.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.440
You can add service functions, you can add additional services

19:29.440 --> 19:33.440
that will be a competitive advantage for your company at this stage,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.440
relative to your competitors.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.440
What is the sales strategy here?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.440
Of course, intensive sales.

19:39.440 --> 19:44.440
At the growth stage, as we have already said, our main goal is to expand the market.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.440
Accordingly, we can make and implement the expansion of the market only with the help of intensive sales.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.440
Intensive sales means the maximum number of intermediaries,

19:54.440 --> 19:57.440
the maximum that we can organize with you.

19:57.440 --> 20:02.440
Price. Of course, the price will play a very big role here.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.440
But if our task is to expand the market,

20:04.440 --> 20:07.440
our profit or our marginal income,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.440
we must act a little, we must reduce it a little

20:11.440 --> 20:15.440
in order to win the market, to outrun our competitors.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
The communication system.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.440
What will we do in the communication system with you?

20:20.440 --> 20:23.440
Of course, we will determine the image of the product.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.440
We have already informed our clients that our product exists.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.440
We have told them about the characteristics, we have taught them to use our product.

20:30.440 --> 20:36.440
Now we need to consolidate the image, increase the popularity of our product.

20:36.440 --> 20:41.440
Accordingly, all the communications that we produce should be aimed at this.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
The next stage is turbulence.

20:43.440 --> 20:48.440
Just the same stage that we talked about, very specific.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.440
What is the characteristic of the macro environment at this stage?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
Slowdown in growth rates.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.440
We no longer see such an intense growth as at the previous stage.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.440
It begins to decrease.

20:59.440 --> 21:04.440
And, accordingly, there is a hard division of the market between competitors.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.440
After all, someone must leave this market.

21:06.440 --> 21:12.440
So many competitors cannot offer their products and, accordingly, the strongest will survive.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.440
Weak competitors simply leave the market.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
What is the goal here?

21:17.440 --> 21:26.440
The market majority, which is about 60%, 60-65% according to statistics,

21:26.440 --> 21:28.440
depending, of course, on the product.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.440
This is our goal.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.440
Here we begin to sell the product most massively.

21:35.440 --> 21:40.440
But, nevertheless, the profit at this stage is not the greatest,

21:40.440 --> 21:43.440
because funds are spent on the fight against competitors.

21:43.440 --> 21:47.440
Strategic goals. What are they characterized by?

21:47.440 --> 21:50.440
The first is, of course, working with target segments.

21:50.440 --> 21:55.440
Look, at the previous stage, we made an intensive sale.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.440
We sold to everyone who could, who would buy this product.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.440
Now comes the stage of specialization,

22:02.440 --> 22:04.440
when it is necessary to clearly segment the market,

22:04.440 --> 22:10.440
to highlight its target segments and direct its impact only on the target segments.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.440
We will consider the segmentation method,

22:13.440 --> 22:20.440
we will determine our target segments in order to optimize and concentrate resources,

22:20.440 --> 22:23.440
and not shoot at the sparrows with guns.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.440
What is the goal here?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.440
The maximization of the market share. Why?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.440
Because the larger the market share we capture,

22:30.440 --> 22:33.440
the more stable we will feel,

22:33.440 --> 22:36.440
because competitors want to take what is theirs.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.440
What is the other goal?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.440
The clear positioning of the trading mark.

22:40.440 --> 22:44.440
After all, as they say, if we do not position it in the head of the buyer,

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
the buyer will position it on his own.

22:46.440 --> 22:51.440
And another goal is to maintain loyalty to the product or the trading mark.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.440
This is what you decide for yourself.

22:54.440 --> 22:59.440
If it is an industrial product, then, accordingly, you form loyalty to the brand of the company

22:59.440 --> 23:03.440
or to the trading mark that you have determined for your product.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.440
What is the marketing program characterized by?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
If we have highlighted our target segments,

23:08.440 --> 23:13.440
of course, for each target segment we will make our own individual proposal.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.440
Therefore, here we will divide the range,

23:17.440 --> 23:24.440
determine the price and communication depending on the target segment.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.440
Everything is directed only at this.

23:26.440 --> 23:33.440
And in each target segment we will have our own communication, price and range.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
The next stage is maturity.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
Maturity is a good stage.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.440
When there are stable sales of products,

23:39.440 --> 23:42.440
when there is a share of the market that we hold.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.440
True, the margin of income and profit are slightly reduced,

23:45.440 --> 23:50.440
but due to the turnover that we have, we get enough.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.440
What is the characteristic of the macro environment at this stage?

23:53.440 --> 23:55.440
The first is non-expanding demand.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.440
The market has stagnated.

23:58.440 --> 24:03.440
It has become constant and we can only count on some deepening.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.440
We must accept and understand this.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.440
Regarding competition.

24:08.440 --> 24:14.440
At this stage, there is usually a certain number of strong competitors

24:14.440 --> 24:19.440
who have established their place in this market and are playing the leading positions.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.440
At this stage, it is very difficult to enter the market.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.440
There are very high entry barriers,

24:25.440 --> 24:30.440
because the number of competitors and the number of players in this market has become stable.

24:30.440 --> 24:35.440
Most often, these companies do not allow beginners to enter this market.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.440
It is very difficult.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.440
What strategic goals do we pursue at this stage?

24:41.440 --> 24:43.440
The first is, of course, the differentiation of goods.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.440
What is it?

24:44.440 --> 24:47.440
We should not allow the goods to be like one another,

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
similar to the goods of competitors.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.440
We should be different in something.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.440
What is a competitive advantage?

24:54.440 --> 24:58.440
A competitive advantage is when your product or service

24:58.440 --> 25:05.440
has at least some positive difference from the competitors.

25:05.440 --> 25:08.440
And the main buyer knows about it.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.440
Or you try to convey this information to him.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.440
That is, the difference, differentiation is the most important thing here.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.440
If your product merges with the products of competitors,

25:18.440 --> 25:21.440
it is unlikely that you will keep your share of the market.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.440
What other goals do we set for ourselves?

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
The exit to new niches.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.440
After all, we want to develop, and the market has already risen.

25:27.440 --> 25:32.440
We are looking for new niches, new segments that could use our products.

25:32.440 --> 25:37.440
And this allows us to expand at this stage.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
What happens to the goods?

25:39.440 --> 25:42.440
We understand that the goods that are at the stage of maturity

25:42.440 --> 25:45.440
will come to the stage of decline.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
What should be done?

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
New functions should be added,

25:49.440 --> 25:52.440
new types of goods should be changed and developed

25:52.440 --> 25:54.440
in order to extend their life.

25:54.440 --> 25:58.440
Or finish the life of this modification

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
and bring a new product to the market,

26:00.440 --> 26:02.440
and manage to do it at the same time,

26:02.440 --> 26:05.440
so that the company does not have failures,

26:05.440 --> 26:08.440
breaks in the sale of this product.

26:08.440 --> 26:09.440
Marketing program.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.440
What are we focusing on in the marketing program?

26:12.440 --> 26:15.440
The first is, of course, the product, the assortment.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.440
As I said, the assortment should be differentiated,

26:18.440 --> 26:20.440
that is, to be different from the competitors.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
And what is interesting,

26:22.440 --> 26:24.440
there should be a difference in each segment,

26:24.440 --> 26:27.440
because there are competitors in each segment.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
And we will pay attention to this in the future.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.440
The sales system.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.440
The sales system returns to the selective.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.440
We no longer use intensive sales.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.440
Why?

26:37.440 --> 26:41.440
Because we are satisfied with those companies

26:41.440 --> 26:44.440
that have shown themselves to be the most active,

26:44.440 --> 26:46.440
sell our goods the best.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.440
We leave a limited number of intermediaries

26:49.440 --> 26:52.440
and only through them we sell our products.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.440
This allows us to control them more rigidly,

26:55.440 --> 26:58.440
which is very important at the stage of maturity

26:58.440 --> 27:00.440
to save our share of the market,

27:00.440 --> 27:02.440
so that it does not fall anywhere.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
Communication.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.440
What do we do with the communication system?

27:05.440 --> 27:08.440
Of course, we direct it all to loyalty.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.440
We need to keep existing customers.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
New customers are great.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.440
And there is always a certain rotation of the customer base in the company.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.440
But it is expensive to look for new customers.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.440
At the stage of maturity, this is almost unacceptable.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.440
Therefore, the most important thing here is

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
to keep the base of existing customers

27:26.440 --> 27:28.440
with whom we have been working for a long time,

27:28.440 --> 27:30.440
who know our product, know its specifics

27:30.440 --> 27:33.440
and know how to present it on our market.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.440
And the last stage is the stage of decline or decline,

27:36.440 --> 27:40.440
when our product, according to all the laws, should die.

27:40.440 --> 27:44.440
Fortunately or unfortunately, this happens at a certain point.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.440
What is the characteristic of the macro environment at this stage?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
This is zero demand, in fact.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
Or even negative.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.440
That is, the demand is falling,

27:53.440 --> 27:56.440
no one wants to buy our product anymore.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.440
Because it has either become morally outdated,

27:58.440 --> 28:02.440
or technically, or there are more interesting new models

28:02.440 --> 28:05.440
for the consumer or for our client.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
What is our goal?

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
Of course, the segment of conservators.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
There are always people who are used to this product,

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
who like it,

28:13.440 --> 28:16.440
who come again and again for this modification.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.440
And there is nothing strange about it.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.440
Therefore, of course, we must focus on this segment.

28:22.440 --> 28:26.440
And slowly start selling our product.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.440
Competitors.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.440
Competitors leave the market.

28:30.440 --> 28:35.440
Or they also take this product out of their assortment.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.440
What are the strategic goals of the company?

28:38.440 --> 28:39.440
What should it do?

28:39.440 --> 28:42.440
What strategic goals are pursued by the company at this stage?

28:42.440 --> 28:44.440
Well, of course, leaving this market.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.440
With this particular product.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.440
If there are new modifications,

28:48.440 --> 28:50.440
a new stage of the life cycle begins.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.440
And with this product modification,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.440
of course, care.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.440
Gradual care, not sudden.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.440
This is the plus.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.440
That is, we should not immediately cut off all the ends.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.440
What can be done?

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
You can turn into a specialist firm

29:05.440 --> 29:07.440
and say, we sell only this product,

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
we specialize in it.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.440
We offer this product best of all.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.440
This will help to sell the rest of the product,

29:15.440 --> 29:18.440
to offer a new model to the market in the future.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
What is the marketing program?

29:21.440 --> 29:23.440
What is done here?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
In the marketing program,

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
I would like to say especially about the fact

29:27.440 --> 29:31.440
that at this stage you cannot advertise your product en masse.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.440
Because this is perceived by consumers negatively.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.440
As soon as you advertise a product

29:36.440 --> 29:38.440
that is at the stage of decline,

29:38.440 --> 29:41.440
your product dies instantly.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.440
And you won't even be able to sell it.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
And the most important thing here is

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
to gradually sell our product.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.440
Therefore, you need to work very carefully with our clients.

29:51.440 --> 29:55.440
The first thing to do is to put a limited assortment of products on the market.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.440
That is, only the best-selling models

29:58.440 --> 30:00.440
that were in this assortment.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.440
This is the first.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.440
The second is the price.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
Well, it depends on the buyers.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.440
If buyers come for this product,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
if there is a segment of conservators

30:10.440 --> 30:13.440
who are ready to buy it for some time,

30:13.440 --> 30:15.440
you can even raise the price.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
Because there is not much of this product left.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.440
But if such a situation is not observed,

30:20.440 --> 30:23.440
then, of course, it is better to lower the prices

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
and slowly sell the product

30:25.440 --> 30:28.440
in order not to cause any negativity for the buyers.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.440
The communication system.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.440
What do we do with the communication system?

30:32.440 --> 30:35.440
The communication system is aimed at loyal consumers.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Only at them.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.440
That is, those who like the product,

30:39.440 --> 30:40.440
who buy it,

30:40.440 --> 30:42.440
we only work with them.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.440
We inform them about discounts,

30:44.440 --> 30:46.440
invite them to various programs,

30:46.440 --> 30:49.440
hold small promotional events for them

30:49.440 --> 30:54.440
so that the product is gradually and finally sold.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.440
And the sales system.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.440
Of course, high-selective sales,

30:58.440 --> 31:00.440
or maybe even exclusive.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.440
We leave a minimum number of distributors

31:03.440 --> 31:06.440
or dealers in this distribution system.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.440
Because the product is sold,

31:08.440 --> 31:10.440
there is no point in spending large funds

31:10.440 --> 31:14.440
to supply the product to the entire retail network.

31:14.440 --> 31:19.440
Thus, we have considered all stages of the product life cycle

31:19.440 --> 31:21.440
and saw that at each stage

31:21.440 --> 31:24.440
the distribution system has its own specifics.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.440
This must be taken into account

31:26.440 --> 31:28.440
when forming a retail network.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.440
And what to do if there are different products

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
in the assortment portfolio?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.440
And so it happens.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.440
It never happens that the products are new

31:38.440 --> 31:41.440
or only at the stage of maturity or only at the stage of decline.

31:41.440 --> 31:44.440
Every time you need to look at

31:44.440 --> 31:46.440
what product,

31:46.440 --> 31:49.440
on what distribution channels we can sell.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.440
This specificity must be taken into account.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.440
That is why the sales system

31:54.440 --> 31:56.440
is a very complex strategic process

31:56.440 --> 31:58.440
that needs to be managed.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.440
You can manage it only when

32:00.440 --> 32:02.440
you will adjust the sales system

32:02.440 --> 32:05.440
for each group of goods.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.440
We have considered the product life cycle.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.440
What sales strategies

32:10.440 --> 32:12.440
are recommended to use

32:12.440 --> 32:14.440
at each product life cycle?

32:14.440 --> 32:17.440
Now let's turn to the sales strategies

32:17.440 --> 32:19.440
of the company in more detail.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
You can see them on the slide.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.440
The first strategy that we will consider

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
is, of course, the intensive sales strategy.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
This is one of the three strategies

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
that relate to indirect sales.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.440
Indirect sales is sales through an intermediary,

32:32.440 --> 32:34.440
that is, not directly to customers.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.440
Intensive sales.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.440
What is this strategy?

32:38.440 --> 32:41.440
This is when we sell to the maximum number of customers.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.440
Let's take an example of a food product market.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.440
For example, we sell chocolate.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.440
In order for it to sell well,

32:50.440 --> 32:52.440
it must be presented

32:52.440 --> 32:54.440
in the maximum number of points.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.440
Why?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
Because if there is no chocolate,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.440
the customer will easily switch to another one.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.440
He will not go to the second or third store

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
to buy the chocolate he needs.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.440
In most cases.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.440
Of course, not everyone will do this,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.440
but nevertheless, most buyers

33:10.440 --> 33:13.440
tend to switch to another product.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.440
And it's good if they don't like the product.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
And if they like it,

33:17.440 --> 33:19.440
they are unlikely to return to you.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.440
And thus you lose customers.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.440
Therefore, the key factor of success

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
is the presence of the product

33:25.440 --> 33:27.440
in the maximum number of points

33:27.440 --> 33:30.440
so that the customer can find your product anywhere.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.440
Of course, this strategy has pros and cons.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.440
What are the main advantages?

33:34.440 --> 33:36.440
The first is a fast exit to the market.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.440
Of course, when we sell our product

33:39.440 --> 33:41.440
through the maximum number of intermediaries,

33:41.440 --> 33:43.440
it is faster to be mastered

33:43.440 --> 33:45.440
in all markets where we offer it.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.440
That is, we have the opportunity

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
to quickly go to the market,

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
to shorten the time.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.440
This is a very big plus

33:52.440 --> 33:55.440
in our fast-flowing century.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.440
To outrun competitors is the main advantage here.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.440
And of course, the maximum market capacity.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.440
Not only did we exit quickly,

34:02.440 --> 34:04.440
we occupied the trading points

34:04.440 --> 34:06.440
that we needed.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.440
However, there are also cons.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.440
What are the cons?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.440
Loss of control over the market.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.440
You can't control every intermediary

34:13.440 --> 34:15.440
that offers your product.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.440
It's very difficult,

34:17.440 --> 34:19.440
and almost impossible.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.440
If we say that we control everyone,

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
we are deceiving ourselves.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.440
This is not true.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.440
It is impossible to control everyone,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.440
even small intermediaries.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.440
What else can be a minus?

34:30.440 --> 34:32.440
The image of the company can be worsened.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.440
I'll give you an example.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
The Moscow company,

34:36.440 --> 34:38.440
a milk product manufacturer,

34:38.440 --> 34:42.440
produces circuses glazed in chocolate.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.440
One of the intermediaries

34:44.440 --> 34:46.440
is located in Vladivostok.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.440
The company uses

34:48.440 --> 34:50.440
the strategy of intensive sales.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.440
What happened in this company?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.440
There was a decline in the market.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.440
Summer season.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.440
The sales fell,

34:58.440 --> 35:00.440
and the company decided

35:00.440 --> 35:02.440
to reduce the price

35:02.440 --> 35:04.440
to activate the sales.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.440
It offered its intermediaries

35:06.440 --> 35:08.440
the product at a reduced price.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.440
The intermediaries happily bought it,

35:10.440 --> 35:12.440
because they understood

35:12.440 --> 35:14.440
that it is always easier

35:14.440 --> 35:16.440
to sell a product at a lower price.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.440
This is a certain advantage

35:18.440 --> 35:20.440
over competitors.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.440
Everyone bought it,

35:22.440 --> 35:24.440
but you understand

35:24.440 --> 35:26.440
that the production was limited.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.440
The circuses were also limited.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.440
The production was offered

35:30.440 --> 35:32.440
at the end of July.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.440
It took about a month and a half

35:34.440 --> 35:36.440
to realize the product,

35:36.440 --> 35:38.440
which was enough

35:38.440 --> 35:40.440
at the offered prices.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.440
It was necessary to free up the warehouse

35:42.440 --> 35:44.440
to sell the new product.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.440
What did they do in Vladivostok?

35:46.440 --> 35:48.440
They decided

35:48.440 --> 35:50.440
why they would sell

35:50.440 --> 35:52.440
at a reduced price.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.440
The market was going up

35:54.440 --> 35:56.440
from August 25th

35:56.440 --> 35:58.440
to August 25th.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.440
They decided

36:00.440 --> 36:02.440
to sell the product

36:02.440 --> 36:04.440
at the offered prices

36:04.440 --> 36:06.440
until September 10th.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.440
They decided

36:08.440 --> 36:10.440
to sell the product

36:10.440 --> 36:12.440
at a reduced price.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.440
Of course,

36:14.440 --> 36:16.440
they did not consult

36:16.440 --> 36:18.440
the manufacturers.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.440
It was in their financial interests.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.440
They waited until August 25th

36:22.440 --> 36:24.440
and sold the product

36:24.440 --> 36:26.440
at the shops in Vladivostok.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.440
Of course,

36:28.440 --> 36:30.440
no miracle happened.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.440
The company did not sell

36:32.440 --> 36:34.440
the product.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.440
But the horror is

36:36.440 --> 36:38.440
that many shops

36:38.440 --> 36:40.440
do not control

36:40.440 --> 36:42.440
the shelf life of the products

36:42.440 --> 36:44.440
on their shelves.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.440
The specificity of the retail

36:46.440 --> 36:48.440
is so far possible.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.440
The product was left on the shelves

36:50.440 --> 36:52.440
after September 10th.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.440
Then, in Vladivostok,

36:54.440 --> 36:56.440
11 children were poisoned.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.440
Thank God,

36:58.440 --> 37:00.440
all of them survived.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.440
But the wave

37:02.440 --> 37:04.440
was very strong.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.440
It was published in the media

37:06.440 --> 37:08.440
and on TV.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.440
Of course,

37:10.440 --> 37:12.440
the manufacturer was blamed

37:12.440 --> 37:14.440
and not the intermediary company.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.440
The manufacturer was mentioned

37:16.440 --> 37:18.440
and the company

37:18.440 --> 37:20.440
could not sell

37:20.440 --> 37:22.440
the product for 2.5 years.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.440
Nobody bought it.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.440
Thus, the intermediary

37:26.440 --> 37:28.440
ruined the image of the company.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.440
Here is one example

37:30.440 --> 37:32.440
of loss of control.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.440
The next strategy

37:34.440 --> 37:36.440
is the selective sale.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.440
It is a sale

37:38.440 --> 37:40.440
through a certain number of intermediaries.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.440
We do not sell

37:42.440 --> 37:44.440
everywhere as in the previous case.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.440
We sell through certain companies

37:46.440 --> 37:48.440
that we have chosen

37:48.440 --> 37:50.440
and evaluated.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.440
What are the advantages

37:52.440 --> 37:54.440
and disadvantages?

37:54.440 --> 37:56.440
The advantage is that we can

37:56.440 --> 37:58.440
effectively cooperate with intermediaries.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.440
We can control, guide,

38:00.440 --> 38:02.440
train and optimize the assortment.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.440
We have more effective interaction.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.440
We understand each other.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.440
The number of intermediaries is limited.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.440
We can control

38:10.440 --> 38:12.440
the price formation,

38:12.440 --> 38:14.440
the assortment

38:14.440 --> 38:16.440
and the methods of competition.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.440
We can do all this

38:18.440 --> 38:20.440
because the company has enough resources.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.440
What is the disadvantage?

38:22.440 --> 38:24.440
The limited market coverage

38:24.440 --> 38:26.440
compared to the previous example.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.440
We cannot simply

38:28.440 --> 38:30.440
put our product everywhere.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.440
We have a slower market output.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.440
And, of course, the buyer

38:34.440 --> 38:36.440
cannot find our product in every trading point.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.440
But in some cases it is not necessary.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.440
For example, the furniture market.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.440
It is not necessary

38:42.440 --> 38:44.440
to have it in every store.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.440
Because we go to the furniture store

38:46.440 --> 38:48.440
instead of the grocery store

38:48.440 --> 38:50.440
or some other center.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.440
The household equipment market

38:54.440 --> 38:56.440
also includes its own stores

38:56.440 --> 38:58.440
and retail chains.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.440
There is no need

39:00.440 --> 39:02.440
for an intensive sales strategy.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.440
The selective sales strategy

39:04.440 --> 39:06.440
or the elective strategy is used

39:06.440 --> 39:08.440
and works very well.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.440
The next option

39:10.440 --> 39:12.440
is the exclusive sales strategy.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.440
The exclusive sales strategy

39:14.440 --> 39:16.440
is the sales of one intermediary

39:16.440 --> 39:18.440
on a given territory.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.440
It does not mean that you have

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
a company all over the country

39:22.440 --> 39:24.440
that offers products.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.440
Of course, not.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
Each territory has its own intermediary

39:28.440 --> 39:30.440
that represents your interests.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.440
This strategy has its advantages

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
and disadvantages.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.440
The first advantage is

39:36.440 --> 39:38.440
that you control every step of your intermediary.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.440
You have a limited number of intermediaries.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.440
For example,

39:42.440 --> 39:44.440
you are represented in six regions

39:44.440 --> 39:46.440
and you have six intermediaries.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.440
It is very easy to control them,

39:48.440 --> 39:50.440
to cooperate with them.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.440
It is great to work with them

39:52.440 --> 39:54.440
as with partners.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.440
And of course,

39:56.440 --> 39:58.440
the image of the brand is well maintained.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.440
It does not suffer anymore.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.440
But what is the disadvantage?

40:02.440 --> 40:04.440
The disadvantage is the very limited market coverage.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.440
The second disadvantage is that you depend on your intermediary.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.440
If he suddenly stops working

40:08.440 --> 40:10.440
on your product,

40:10.440 --> 40:12.440
he will stop working

40:12.440 --> 40:14.440
if he stops making money.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.440
Because the main goal of an intermediary

40:16.440 --> 40:18.440
is not your product,

40:18.440 --> 40:20.440
but the profit he gets from it.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.440
If he was offered

40:22.440 --> 40:24.440
some other product with more profitable conditions,

40:24.440 --> 40:26.440
he will naturally move there.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.440
If, of course,

40:28.440 --> 40:30.440
you do not have a loyal system,

40:30.440 --> 40:32.440
you do not have personal relations with this client,

40:32.440 --> 40:34.440
and so on.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.440
And one more disadvantage.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.440
It is a very high demand for the quality of the product.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.440
Everything is under the radar here.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.440
Everything is considered under the magnifying glass.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.440
An intermediary who takes your product

40:44.440 --> 40:46.440
as an exclusive

40:46.440 --> 40:48.440
will simply not sell a low-quality product.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.440
He will not be interested in it.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.440
I will give an example

40:52.440 --> 40:54.440
of dependence on an intermediary,

40:54.440 --> 40:56.440
which, in general,

40:56.440 --> 40:58.440
needs to be feared

40:58.440 --> 41:00.440
and not to be allowed

41:00.440 --> 41:02.440
to do business.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.440
When I worked at an industrial enterprise,

41:04.440 --> 41:06.440
we formed a home network

41:06.440 --> 41:08.440
on air conditioning systems.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.440
It was 1998.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.440
It was a very good situation

41:12.440 --> 41:14.440
when foreign companies

41:14.440 --> 41:16.440
began to leave the market,

41:16.440 --> 41:18.440
and domestic manufacturers

41:18.440 --> 41:20.440
began to raise their heads.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.440
At that time,

41:22.440 --> 41:24.440
one of the enterprises

41:24.440 --> 41:26.440
purchased very serious equipment

41:26.440 --> 41:28.440
and, using assembly technology,

41:28.440 --> 41:30.440
assembled air conditioning systems.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.440
There were split systems

41:32.440 --> 41:34.440
and central air conditioning systems.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
And, of course, we needed a home network.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.440
In one of the regions,

41:38.440 --> 41:40.440
the North-Western region,

41:40.440 --> 41:42.440
we had a contract

41:42.440 --> 41:44.440
for exclusive distribution.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.440
That is, one company

41:46.440 --> 41:48.440
represented our interests.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.440
But after analyzing the sales,

41:50.440 --> 41:52.440
we saw that the sales were not going as well

41:52.440 --> 41:54.440
as we would like.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.440
We assessed the potential of this region

41:56.440 --> 41:58.440
and found that the company

41:58.440 --> 42:00.440
was not working at full capacity.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.440
We began to analyze their sales.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.440
We were given an answer

42:04.440 --> 42:06.440
that our products were not very well known

42:06.440 --> 42:08.440
and the price was a little high,

42:08.440 --> 42:10.440
so they were not selling very well.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.440
But in other regions,

42:12.440 --> 42:14.440
the products were very successful.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.440
We began to conduct an analysis.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.440
We interviewed the clients of the companies

42:18.440 --> 42:20.440
who bought these products

42:20.440 --> 42:22.440
in order to understand

42:22.440 --> 42:24.440
how they were doing.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.440
When interviewing the clients,

42:26.440 --> 42:28.440
we found out the following situation.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.440
The company's work is not satisfied

42:30.440 --> 42:32.440
with the market of St. Petersburg

42:32.440 --> 42:34.440
because it does not fulfill

42:34.440 --> 42:36.440
its obligations on service,

42:36.440 --> 42:38.440
delivery,

42:38.440 --> 42:40.440
service of air conditioning systems.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.440
And this is very important

42:42.440 --> 42:44.440
because it is a technology.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.440
Moreover, the market is narrow.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.440
The clients were very happy

42:48.440 --> 42:50.440
with each other.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.440
They were very happy

42:52.440 --> 42:54.440
because the clients

42:54.440 --> 42:56.440
were very fast in delivering information.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.440
And the company itself,

42:58.440 --> 43:00.440
not even in relation to our products,

43:00.440 --> 43:02.440
but in general,

43:02.440 --> 43:04.440
began to lose its position in this market.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.440
But since their turnover was high,

43:06.440 --> 43:08.440
they did not feel it.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.440
Accordingly, we decided

43:10.440 --> 43:12.440
to terminate the exclusive contract

43:12.440 --> 43:14.440
and work with a completely different company.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.440
We chose not such a large company,

43:16.440 --> 43:18.440
an average company,

43:18.440 --> 43:20.440
but a very actively developing one.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.440
Just after the change

43:22.440 --> 43:24.440
of the exclusive distributor,

43:24.440 --> 43:26.440
our sales increased by 27%.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.440
This was a very good result.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.440
There was a clear reason

43:30.440 --> 43:32.440
why the sales did not go the way

43:32.440 --> 43:34.440
we wanted.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.440
There is one more strategy left.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.440
This is a strategy of direct sales.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.440
In the whole world,

43:40.440 --> 43:42.440
this strategy is considered the most effective

43:42.440 --> 43:44.440
because you offer the product yourself,

43:44.440 --> 43:46.440
you sell it yourself,

43:46.440 --> 43:48.440
you can tell everything about it

43:48.440 --> 43:50.440
to your client directly.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.440
And this is a big plus.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.440
Moreover, during the deal

43:54.440 --> 43:56.440
you can offer special conditions,

43:56.440 --> 43:58.440
which is often done.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.440
No one will know about it.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.440
This is also a plus,

44:02.440 --> 44:04.440
because it leads to the result.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.440
What are the disadvantages?

44:06.440 --> 44:08.440
The disadvantage is that professionals are needed.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.440
If your product is offered

44:10.440 --> 44:12.440
by an unprofessional seller,

44:12.440 --> 44:14.440
the deal can go wrong,

44:14.440 --> 44:16.440
even a very large one.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.440
But in the direct sales market

44:18.440 --> 44:20.440
the deals are usually very large.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.440
Therefore,

44:22.440 --> 44:24.440
very serious professionals

44:24.440 --> 44:26.440
are needed for direct sales.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.440
What else would I like to say

44:28.440 --> 44:30.440
about direct sales?

44:30.440 --> 44:32.440
You probably know the so-called

44:32.440 --> 44:34.440
network marketing system.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.440
Although these are also direct sales,

44:36.440 --> 44:38.440
in the West it is considered

44:38.440 --> 44:40.440
one of the most effective methods of sales.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.440
Many companies work like this.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.440
Unfortunately, in Russia

44:44.440 --> 44:46.440
the Chinese product,

44:46.440 --> 44:48.440
which was sold by hand,

44:48.440 --> 44:50.440
was discredited.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.440
It was of absolutely low quality

44:52.440 --> 44:54.440
and could be thrown away the next day.

44:54.440 --> 44:56.440
There was no guarantee.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.440
In one of the companies

44:58.440 --> 45:00.440
the water purification system was sold.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.440
They were assembled using assembly technology

45:02.440 --> 45:04.440
and then sold.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.440
The assembly was done using Korean technology.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.440
The components were purchased,

45:08.440 --> 45:10.440
assembled and offered to the market.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.440
When the Korean specialists came,

45:12.440 --> 45:14.440
they asked

45:14.440 --> 45:16.440
why we did not want to sell our products

45:16.440 --> 45:18.440
using such methods,

45:18.440 --> 45:20.440
such network marketing methods.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.440
We were very surprised

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
because in this case

45:24.440 --> 45:26.440
this product would not be

45:26.440 --> 45:28.440
taken seriously.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.440
The water purification systems were very serious.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.440
But this company,

45:32.440 --> 45:34.440
surprisingly,

45:34.440 --> 45:36.440
as a result of 2002

45:36.440 --> 45:38.440
became the fastest-growing company in the world

45:38.440 --> 45:40.440
only because

45:40.440 --> 45:42.440
they sold their water purifier

45:42.440 --> 45:44.440
in this way.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.440
Probably,

45:46.440 --> 45:48.440
the time will come when this system

45:48.440 --> 45:50.440
will restore its status in Russia.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.440
We can give an example

45:52.440 --> 45:54.440
of a positive Russian business.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.440
Faberlic company

45:56.440 --> 45:58.440
distributes its products

45:58.440 --> 46:00.440
using this system.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.440
They worked very well.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.440
They immediately decided

46:04.440 --> 46:06.440
on such a sales strategy.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.440
They said that they did not have money

46:08.440 --> 46:10.440
to develop their own sales system.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.440
It is very expensive and costly.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.440
It is better to invest

46:14.440 --> 46:16.440
in the development of the product,

46:16.440 --> 46:18.440
the quality and image of the product.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.440
And then, when the money will come,

46:20.440 --> 46:22.440
we will create our own system.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.440
Now is the time when they create

46:24.440 --> 46:26.440
their own stores and sales network.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.440
At the same time,

46:28.440 --> 46:30.440
they worked on the network marketing system

46:30.440 --> 46:32.440
for about 7 years

46:32.440 --> 46:34.440
and developed their sales.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.440
This company has very good results.

46:36.440 --> 46:38.440
This is a positive example of our market.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.440
I think it will develop further.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.440
Let's see

46:42.440 --> 46:44.440
what types of intermediaries

46:44.440 --> 46:46.440
exist in the application of sales channels.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.440
There are indirect sales

46:48.440 --> 46:50.440
and direct sales.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.440
In the indirect sales strategy,

46:52.440 --> 46:54.440
intermediaries are divided into two types.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.440
They are the owners of the product

46:56.440 --> 46:58.440
and the non-owners.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.440
Those who buy the product

47:00.440 --> 47:02.440
and then sell it

47:02.440 --> 47:04.440
or those who simply offer

47:04.440 --> 47:06.440
the product as agents

47:06.440 --> 47:08.440
and get their interest

47:08.440 --> 47:10.440
and sell it to the client.

47:10.440 --> 47:12.440
What intermediaries

47:12.440 --> 47:14.440
do the owners of the product have?

47:14.440 --> 47:16.440
They are dealers, distributors,

47:16.440 --> 47:18.440
wholesalers,

47:18.440 --> 47:20.440
retail networks

47:20.440 --> 47:22.440
where we sell our product

47:22.440 --> 47:24.440
and they offer it to the end user.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.440
These are companies that sell

47:28.440 --> 47:30.440
their products by catalog.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.440
There are also non-owners.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.440
These are agents,

47:34.440 --> 47:36.440
retail representatives, brokers,

47:36.440 --> 47:38.440
independent agents.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.440
They do not buy,

47:40.440 --> 47:42.440
they just offer the product

47:42.440 --> 47:44.440
and then sell it.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.440
There are also direct sales.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.440
There are no intermediaries.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.440
The company sells itself.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.440
The main seller

47:52.440 --> 47:54.440
is the retail staff

47:54.440 --> 47:56.440
of the company that offers the product.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.440
The retail staff

47:58.440 --> 48:00.440
is the catalog

48:00.440 --> 48:02.440
that develops the product.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.440
This is a mail mail

48:04.440 --> 48:06.440
that is sent by the sellers.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.440
Telemarketing,

48:08.440 --> 48:10.440
phone sales

48:10.440 --> 48:12.440
is also one of the effective channels

48:12.440 --> 48:14.440
of sales

48:14.440 --> 48:16.440
but only in the case of

48:16.440 --> 48:18.440
simple technical production.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.440
We have discussed the main strategies

48:20.440 --> 48:22.440
of sales. However, before

48:22.440 --> 48:24.440
developing your sales strategy,

48:24.440 --> 48:26.440
you need to analyze

48:26.440 --> 48:28.440
how your sales departments

48:28.440 --> 48:30.440
work in your company.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.440
The sales system

48:32.440 --> 48:34.440
that you plan to develop

48:34.440 --> 48:36.440
must be exactly

48:36.440 --> 48:38.440
in line with the structure of your company.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.440
Otherwise, there will be a disbalance

48:40.440 --> 48:42.440
and your system will never work effectively.

48:42.440 --> 48:44.440
Let's see what are the structures

48:44.440 --> 48:46.440
of sales in organizations.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.440
The first is the structure of the product specialization.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.440
You can see it on the slide.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.440
What is the system

48:52.440 --> 48:54.440
in this case

48:54.440 --> 48:56.440
in the company

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440
that is formed?

48:58.440 --> 49:00.440
There is a sales director

49:00.440 --> 49:02.440
who is in charge

49:02.440 --> 49:04.440
of product managers.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.440
When is this structure

49:06.440 --> 49:08.440
effective?

49:08.440 --> 49:10.440
First, when you have

49:10.440 --> 49:12.440
a very complex product

49:12.440 --> 49:14.440
and managers should know its specifics.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.440
They should be able to explain

49:16.440 --> 49:18.440
technical characteristics,

49:18.440 --> 49:20.440
consumer characteristics,

49:20.440 --> 49:22.440
operating system,

49:22.440 --> 49:24.440
features.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.440
When the product is complex,

49:26.440 --> 49:28.440
this system works the most effectively.

49:28.440 --> 49:30.440
The system of product specialization.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.440
That is,

49:32.440 --> 49:34.440
managers sell one product,

49:34.440 --> 49:36.440
then another,

49:36.440 --> 49:38.440
and so on.

49:38.440 --> 49:40.440
Moreover, everyone sells

49:40.440 --> 49:42.440
the product in all regions.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.440
The advantage is that you can take into account

49:44.440 --> 49:46.440
the product specialization.

49:46.440 --> 49:48.440
The disadvantage is that

49:48.440 --> 49:50.440
you have several people in the company

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
who work on the product.

49:52.440 --> 49:54.440
Each of them goes to one region.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.440
Everyone goes there.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.440
The second one goes there.

50:00.440 --> 50:02.440
It results in duplication.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.440
Therefore, it is necessary

50:04.440 --> 50:06.440
to coordinate the activities of managers

50:06.440 --> 50:08.440
in order to avoid

50:08.440 --> 50:10.440
strong intersections.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.440
Otherwise, what will your intermediaries think about you?

50:12.440 --> 50:14.440
It is a strange company.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.440
First, one offers, then the second,

50:16.440 --> 50:18.440
then the third, and everyone is a manager

50:18.440 --> 50:20.440
in this company.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
The next structure,

50:22.440 --> 50:24.440
which is very often

50:24.440 --> 50:26.440
formed in companies,

50:26.440 --> 50:28.440
is the specialization in the industry.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.440
This is also

50:30.440 --> 50:32.440
most often applied

50:32.440 --> 50:34.440
in the industrial markets.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.440
Because each industry

50:36.440 --> 50:38.440
has its own specifics.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.440
The most important thing is to know

50:40.440 --> 50:42.440
the right person,

50:42.440 --> 50:44.440
the person who can make decisions

50:44.440 --> 50:46.440
about the purchase of this product.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.440
Personal relations are very important here.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.440
The requirements for managers

50:50.440 --> 50:52.440
are different.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.440
In the first case,

50:54.440 --> 50:56.440
they should be experts in the product.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.440
Here they should be able

50:58.440 --> 51:00.440
to establish relations

51:00.440 --> 51:02.440
in order to interact

51:02.440 --> 51:04.440
with each industry.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.440
They should find the right person

51:06.440 --> 51:08.440
and offer their product.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.440
This is the specifics.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.440
The good thing is

51:14.440 --> 51:16.440
that there is a very good specialization.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.440
The bad thing is that

51:18.440 --> 51:20.440
the person is responsible for his own direction.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.440
There is a great dependence on managers.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.440
If the relations are established

51:24.440 --> 51:26.440
and the manager suddenly leaves

51:26.440 --> 51:28.440
the competing company,

51:28.440 --> 51:30.440
consider this industry

51:30.440 --> 51:32.440
to be lost.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.440
At least, the first time of your sale

51:34.440 --> 51:36.440
will definitely decrease.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.440
What is the solution?

51:38.440 --> 51:40.440
Here you need to put

51:40.440 --> 51:42.440
duplicators managers,

51:42.440 --> 51:44.440
assistants,

51:44.440 --> 51:46.440
who have studied and know all clients.

51:46.440 --> 51:48.440
What is the goal?

51:48.440 --> 51:50.440
If the manager suddenly leaves,

51:50.440 --> 51:52.440
you will not be left without this client

51:52.440 --> 51:54.440
and this industry.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.440
This is very important.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.440
Because each industry usually

51:58.440 --> 52:00.440
takes a large share

52:00.440 --> 52:02.440
of the company's sales volume.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.440
Therefore, it is risky.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.440
The next structure is the geographical principle.

52:06.440 --> 52:08.440
It is the most frequently used

52:08.440 --> 52:10.440
product in sales

52:10.440 --> 52:12.440
on the FMCG market.

52:12.440 --> 52:14.440
Because the product is

52:14.440 --> 52:16.440
more understandable,

52:16.440 --> 52:18.440
simpler, there are no specialists

52:18.440 --> 52:20.440
in the product,

52:20.440 --> 52:22.440
there is no need to sell in industries.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.440
It is just a system of distribution

52:24.440 --> 52:26.440
on the territories.

52:26.440 --> 52:28.440
Also, managers are subordinate

52:28.440 --> 52:30.440
to the commercial director.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.440
They are called in different ways.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.440
Regional development manager

52:34.440 --> 52:36.440
or commercial director for each region.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.440
It depends on the scale

52:38.440 --> 52:40.440
of the company.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.440
If the company is very large

52:42.440 --> 52:44.440
and the turnover is serious,

52:44.440 --> 52:46.440
it is better to put a person

52:46.440 --> 52:48.440
who will manage the situation

52:48.440 --> 52:50.440
and make decisions

52:50.440 --> 52:52.440
within the framework of this region.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.440
Because it is unrealistic

52:54.440 --> 52:56.440
to control 89 regions

52:56.440 --> 52:58.440
by one commercial director.

52:58.440 --> 53:00.440
Therefore, you need

53:00.440 --> 53:02.440
such middle managers

53:02.440 --> 53:04.440
who will be authorized

53:04.440 --> 53:06.440
to make decisions

53:06.440 --> 53:08.440
within the framework of these regions.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.440
Usually, it is divided into 6-8 groups

53:10.440 --> 53:12.440
on the territory,

53:12.440 --> 53:14.440
on the map.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.440
And, accordingly,

53:16.440 --> 53:18.440
there are some managers

53:18.440 --> 53:20.440
under this person

53:20.440 --> 53:22.440
who are responsible for the regions.

53:22.440 --> 53:24.440
This is the geographical structure.

53:24.440 --> 53:26.440
The advantage of it is

53:26.440 --> 53:28.440
that it has a very good market coverage,

53:28.440 --> 53:30.440
good controllability

53:30.440 --> 53:32.440
if you have a middle manager.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.440
I don't see any disadvantages.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.440
The only disadvantage

53:36.440 --> 53:38.440
is that if you sell a specialized product,

53:38.440 --> 53:40.440
it will be more difficult

53:40.440 --> 53:42.440
to sell it according to the regional principle.

53:42.440 --> 53:44.440
I would like to say a few words

53:44.440 --> 53:46.440
about the matrix structure.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.440
Matrix structure is the intersection

53:48.440 --> 53:50.440
of the managers on the product

53:50.440 --> 53:52.440
with the managers on the region.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.440
The structure is very interesting

53:54.440 --> 53:56.440
and very complex.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.440
When there are several managers

53:58.440 --> 54:00.440
on the product and several managers

54:00.440 --> 54:02.440
on the region,

54:02.440 --> 54:04.440
they intersect at a certain stage.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.440
For example, this month

54:06.440 --> 54:08.440
there will be a manager on the northwest region

54:08.440 --> 54:10.440
and a manager on the product

54:10.440 --> 54:12.440
and air conditioners.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.440
One person on the region

54:14.440 --> 54:16.440
knows where to offer

54:16.440 --> 54:18.440
and the manager on the product

54:18.440 --> 54:20.440
knows the product's specifics.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.440
Then he can tell you about it.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.440
The compilation of these two people

54:24.440 --> 54:26.440
gives a very good result.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.440
The only disadvantage of this system

54:28.440 --> 54:30.440
is that it is difficult to manage.

54:30.440 --> 54:32.440
And it is expensive

54:32.440 --> 54:34.440
because there are many duplications.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.440
But if it is well managed,

54:36.440 --> 54:38.440
it is very effective

54:38.440 --> 54:40.440
and applicable

54:40.440 --> 54:42.440
in any market.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.440
Many companies

54:44.440 --> 54:46.440
work on this system,

54:46.440 --> 54:48.440
especially foreign companies.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.440
They choose this kind of sales system.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.440
Now we will consider

54:52.440 --> 54:54.440
the main mistakes

54:54.440 --> 54:56.440
when forming a sales channel.

54:56.440 --> 54:58.440
Why do we start with mistakes?

54:58.440 --> 55:00.440
To take them into account right away,

55:00.440 --> 55:02.440
when developing a sales network.

55:02.440 --> 55:04.440
What should we pay attention to?

55:04.440 --> 55:06.440
What is happening in Russia?

55:06.440 --> 55:08.440
What do we usually make mistakes

55:08.440 --> 55:10.440
when forming a sales channel?

55:10.440 --> 55:12.440
What prevents us from working?

55:12.440 --> 55:14.440
The first and the most important mistake

55:14.440 --> 55:16.440
is ignoring the place of purchase

55:16.440 --> 55:18.440
by our product's customers.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.440
Why does this happen?

55:20.440 --> 55:22.440
Because when we start

55:22.440 --> 55:24.440
forming a sales channel,

55:24.440 --> 55:26.440
we look at the commercial practice

55:26.440 --> 55:28.440
of the market and see

55:28.440 --> 55:30.440
that we have domestic manufacturers,

55:30.440 --> 55:32.440
foreign ones,

55:32.440 --> 55:34.440
then distributors,

55:34.440 --> 55:36.440
dealers, retailers,

55:36.440 --> 55:38.440
and retail network that sells the product.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.440
The system is very transparent.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.440
We can see it and say

55:42.440 --> 55:44.440
that we will work with such dealers

55:44.440 --> 55:46.440
and distributors,

55:46.440 --> 55:48.440
and here we will work directly

55:48.440 --> 55:50.440
with the retail network.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.440
But we are going from above.

55:52.440 --> 55:54.440
We are not going from the consumer.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.440
And this is where we violate

55:56.440 --> 55:58.440
the rules of marketing,

55:58.440 --> 56:00.440
because we have to take into account

56:00.440 --> 56:02.440
that sometimes we don't see

56:02.440 --> 56:04.440
where we can sell our product.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.440
Where else can we sell?

56:06.440 --> 56:08.440
Let's think about it.

56:08.440 --> 56:10.440
Where can we buy juice?

56:10.440 --> 56:12.440
Ordinary juice.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.440
We can buy it in a retail store,

56:14.440 --> 56:16.440
we can buy it in some

56:16.440 --> 56:18.440
shopping and entertainment center,

56:18.440 --> 56:20.440
in a regular store,

56:20.440 --> 56:22.440
and even in a tray,

56:22.440 --> 56:24.440
and even in a small pavilion

56:24.440 --> 56:26.440
near a bus stop.

56:26.440 --> 56:28.440
This is the whole household network

56:28.440 --> 56:30.440
where we can buy it.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.440
But the juice manufacturers

56:32.440 --> 56:34.440
went further.

56:34.440 --> 56:36.440
They went from the consumer and thought

56:36.440 --> 56:38.440
where else can people buy juice.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.440
And they remembered, for example,

56:40.440 --> 56:42.440
about the pharmacy networks.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.440
You can buy juice in a pharmacy too.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.440
This is a healthy food product.

56:46.440 --> 56:48.440
Why couldn't the buyer

56:48.440 --> 56:50.440
buy this product there?

56:50.440 --> 56:52.440
Cosmetic companies also went,

56:52.440 --> 56:54.440
and now they offer

56:54.440 --> 56:56.440
their products in the pharmacy networks.

56:56.440 --> 56:58.440
Although this is not a standard

56:58.440 --> 57:00.440
sales channel,

57:00.440 --> 57:02.440
but this option,

57:02.440 --> 57:04.440
this consideration by the consumer

57:04.440 --> 57:06.440
allowed us to see an additional

57:06.440 --> 57:08.440
sales channel.

57:08.440 --> 57:10.440
When we look from above and below

57:10.440 --> 57:12.440
and see the full picture,

57:12.440 --> 57:14.440
the main question we have to answer

57:14.440 --> 57:16.440
is where else

57:16.440 --> 57:18.440
can our product

57:18.440 --> 57:20.440
and our client buy?

57:20.440 --> 57:22.440
You see additional niches

57:22.440 --> 57:24.440
where you can

57:24.440 --> 57:26.440
present your product.

57:26.440 --> 57:28.440
The next mistake

57:28.440 --> 57:30.440
that occurs when you create a sales channel

57:30.440 --> 57:32.440
is the confidence

57:32.440 --> 57:34.440
that the sales channels

57:34.440 --> 57:36.440
will change for your offer,

57:36.440 --> 57:38.440
for your new product.

57:38.440 --> 57:40.440
Everyone will agree to sell it,

57:40.440 --> 57:42.440
to work with it.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.440
This is not true.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.440
A new product

57:46.440 --> 57:48.440
is always a problem for a distributor.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.440
Why? Let's recall

57:50.440 --> 57:52.440
his main goal.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.440
His main goal is to make a profit.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.440
The main goal of the seller

57:56.440 --> 57:58.440
is not to offer a new product.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.440
It's not his product,

58:00.440 --> 58:02.440
it's not his brand.

58:02.440 --> 58:04.440
He is not interested in promoting it.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.440
He is interested in making money.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.440
Products that are already known,

58:08.440 --> 58:10.440
that have their own image,

58:10.440 --> 58:12.440
a brand that has been developed for years,

58:12.440 --> 58:14.440
of course, sell better.

58:14.440 --> 58:16.440
And the main thing is to make

58:16.440 --> 58:18.440
a promotion program.

58:18.440 --> 58:20.440
You need to convince

58:20.440 --> 58:22.440
the next intermediaries

58:22.440 --> 58:24.440
to offer this product.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.440
You need to explain what it is better at.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.440
You need to teach the sales representatives

58:28.440 --> 58:30.440
and intermediaries who will offer this product.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.440
Look how many additional efforts

58:32.440 --> 58:34.440
are needed at once.

58:34.440 --> 58:36.440
Who of us likes to make additional efforts?

58:36.440 --> 58:38.440
Therefore,

58:38.440 --> 58:40.440
if you offer a new product to your intermediaries,

58:40.440 --> 58:42.440
you must

58:42.440 --> 58:44.440
provide some preferences,

58:44.440 --> 58:46.440
improved conditions,

58:46.440 --> 58:48.440
increased discount,

58:48.440 --> 58:50.440
additional support,

58:50.440 --> 58:52.440
or costs that he must pay for promotion.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.440
You must take full responsibility.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.440
This is your product, your brand,

58:56.440 --> 58:58.440
your child.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.440
And who will raise your child for you?

59:00.440 --> 59:02.440
Therefore, of course,

59:02.440 --> 59:04.440
you must take this into account.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.440
The next mistake that is often made

59:06.440 --> 59:08.440
is the inconsistency

59:08.440 --> 59:10.440
in choosing distributors.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.440
Why does this happen?

59:12.440 --> 59:14.440
We need to do everything urgently,

59:14.440 --> 59:16.440
without any hesitation, without any assessments.

59:16.440 --> 59:18.440
There is no time to assess,

59:18.440 --> 59:20.440
we need to go to the market quickly.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.440
Let's go out first,

59:22.440 --> 59:24.440
then we'll see what happens.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.440
As a result, what happens?

59:26.440 --> 59:28.440
We wanted to do it as best as possible,

59:28.440 --> 59:30.440
but we chose the wrong distributors.

59:30.440 --> 59:32.440
They spoil the image of our product,

59:32.440 --> 59:34.440
they sell our product poorly,

59:34.440 --> 59:36.440
and we lose time,

59:36.440 --> 59:38.440
not only time, but money.

59:38.440 --> 59:40.440
Because it is believed that the costs

59:40.440 --> 59:42.440
of searching and working for one distributor

59:42.440 --> 59:44.440
are paid only after a year.

59:44.440 --> 59:46.440
Imagine what additional costs

59:46.440 --> 59:48.440
you will incur,

59:48.440 --> 59:50.440
and no one needs them,

59:50.440 --> 59:52.440
without waiting for some time,

59:52.440 --> 59:54.440
two, three weeks,

59:54.440 --> 59:56.440
in order to clearly assess

59:56.440 --> 59:58.440
the need to work with this company.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.440
Therefore,

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.440
I urge you to make an effective assessment.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440
We will see how to do it further.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.440
The next mistake

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440
is the lack of calculations

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440
in the sales channels.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.440
We do not count.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.440
We only count the costs of promotion,

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.440
of product development.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.440
We are not used to do this

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.440
on the distribution system.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.440
We pay salaries to our managers,

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440
we spend money on business trips,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.440
telephone negotiations,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.440
technical, technological, service support,

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.440
but we do not get the effect.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.440
And all because

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.440
we simply do not count our costs.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.440
Unfortunately.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.440
There is another problem.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.440
Many companies do not have

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.440
a management accounting system.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.440
And when the management accounting system is not established,

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.440
we cannot calculate the costs

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.440
for each channel,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.440
for each intermediary.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.440
We cannot just divide them.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.440
This complicates the assessment.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.440
In this case, what can I say?

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.440
If the company can afford

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.440
to spend money without counting,

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.440
great, let it spend further.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440
If there is a need to optimize expenses,

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440
it is necessary to establish

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.440
a management accounting system

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.440
and start counting.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.440
The lack of budgeting and control

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.440
is the result of the mistake

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.440
that we have just considered.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.440
That is,

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440
since there is no control,

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
we cannot calculate

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440
the effectiveness of work with each intermediary.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
The next mistake is the unwillingness

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440
to give up the existing,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.440
but not profitable sales channels.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.440
What do our merchants say?

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.440
We spent so much effort

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.440
to agree with this intermediary,

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.440
signed a contract,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.440
traveled on business trips many times,

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.440
did everything to work,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
and now you want to give it up?

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440
How is that? What about our work?

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.440
But, you see,

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.440
if we get a minus,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.440
it is no longer a business,

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440
but charity.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440
If the company sets such a goal,

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440
for God's sake,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.440
if you set the goal of making money,

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.440
you will give up

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440
and give up

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.440
the unprofitable sales channels.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440
The next mistake is when

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440
only one sales channel is developed.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.440
Let's try what happens.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.440
If it works out well,

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440
we will move on.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.440
But here are two mistakes.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.440
The first is that we spend time,

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.440
that is, time is spent in addition,

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440
and we do not go to the market effectively,

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.440
and the market coverage is very small.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.440
Therefore, competitors can outrun us.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440
They can outrun us and sell several sales channels at once

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.440
to understand how it works.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440
There is nothing to compare with

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440
if you have just one channel.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440
The next mistake is that

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
conflicts in sales channels are silenced.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440
They are not solved,

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.440
they are not promoted.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.440
Why is this happening?

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440
It seems to all companies that everyone has problems,

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440
and this problem will go away slowly,

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440
or we will solve it.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
In general, something will happen,

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.440
everything will be fine.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440
We show our distributors,

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440
our dealers, our intermediaries

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440
that we just do not want

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.440
to work with them as partners.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
We give it all to them for a discount,

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
and they are doing it themselves,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.440
making mistakes,

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440
worsening the image of the product,

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440
carrying out the so-called

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.440
drain of the product at low prices,

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.440
thus completely spoiling

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440
the market.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440
Therefore, in the form of a conflict,

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440
they must be solved.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.440
Or make an effort

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.440
to eliminate them.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.440
What conflicts usually occur?

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.440
Two intermediaries work,

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
they begin to divide the territory,

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.440
and since they work on the same territory,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.440
they constantly intersect,

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
they compete with each other.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440
How can these problems be solved?

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.440
For example, you can divide the territory,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440
clearly limit it.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.440
Of course, the conflicts will not go away at all,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.440
but they will decrease,

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.440
and this is absolutely true,

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440
and this is the solution to this problem.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
Another option that can be made

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
is to divide the assortment of products.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.440
Part of the assortment should be given to one intermediary,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
and part to a completely different one.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440
Thus, they will not intersect

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.440
in the market, in the territory,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.440
and will fully represent

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
the production of your company.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.440
A very good way out.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.440
So try it.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.440
The next mistake is when

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.440
strategically important business relations are not established.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.440
That is, we do not support

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440
loyal relations.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.440
It seems to us that we have a good product,

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
the margin is good,

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440
the intermediary will not leave us.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440
This is a big mistake.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
You should always try to support

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.440
human relations.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.440
Moreover, for Russia, this is very important.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
When a lot is built

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.440
in business on human relations.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440
Therefore, find people and influence them,

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440
support relations,

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.440
give them some preferences,

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.440
invite them to your holidays,

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.440
to your exhibitions,

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.440
develop loyalty programs

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440
so that the already created system

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440
and the effective one

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440
will not disappear from you.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.440
Otherwise, you will spend additional funds

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
on additional development of the system.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.440
And one more mistake

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
that I would like to mention.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440
The client base is not being conducted.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440
Of course, it is conducted somewhere on paper,

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440
or maybe even on a computer,

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440
but it is not systematized.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.440
All the data that we need

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.440
is not indicated there.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440
It is not updated.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.440
This is not a working system.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.440
The information system should be constantly relevant.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.440
What is it for?

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.440
It is needed primarily for the company manager,

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.440
for the commercial director,

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440
and the least needed

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.440
is the sales manager.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440
Why?

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.440
Because having created your client base,

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.440
the manager can go to another company,

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.440
maybe even to a competitor,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440
and take advantage of this base.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440
But for the company it is a big failure.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440
Therefore,

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.440
the formation of a client base

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440
is strategically important for the company

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440
to keep the client base as much as possible.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.440
Even if your manager leaves,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.440
you can try to restore the relationship.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.440
After all, often the company is loyal

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.440
not just to a person,

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.440
but to the company in general.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
Because you can provide

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.440
a well-established service,

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440
good prices.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440
Then

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
your partner will not leave you.
