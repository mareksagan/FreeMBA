WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
We will start the review of the IT environment for business with the review of telecommunications solutions and products for business.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
We will also talk about the call centers, or as they are also called, contact centers.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Indeed, the number of means of communication of the surrounding managers has become very large.

00:25.000 --> 00:40.000
This includes electronic voice mail, cell phone, several of them, office stationary phone, Wi-Fi, and many instant messages services, such as Instant Messenger, Ask, Skype.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
In addition, the company's offices are united into a single, secure corporate, private VPN network.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
The service on the Russian market for organizing such private networks is becoming more and more in demand.

00:57.000 --> 01:08.000
And, as a rule, telecommunications needs of the medium and small business companies are easily covered by local networks, i.e. wired and wireless.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
However, with the growth of the scale of the business and the emergence of remote offices and affiliates,

01:13.000 --> 01:26.000
such networks need to be united at the enterprise, regardless of its structure, as well as to create a single infocommunication space in which all types of traffic live.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
VPN provides reliable functioning of heavy ERP systems, SRM systems, accounting and logistic programs, and so on.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
For territorially scattered offices, it is critical to create a single office space, regardless of the distance and volume of traffic.

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
Indeed, the implementation of ERP systems or SAPRA systems, or the system of documents of turnover, of the staff, sharply increases the demand for the network of data transfer.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
What solutions can our SMB corporation use?

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
Let's start with wireless technologies. This is the most modern telecommunication solution.

02:07.000 --> 02:21.000
They can be divided into several types. The most short-lived, designed for communication and equipment within the workplace, i.e. for communication with a cell phone, laptop, printer, computer.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
This technology is the most common in the category of Bluetooth, the so-called blue tooth.

02:29.000 --> 02:42.000
The range of interaction from 10 to 100 meters. Obviously, such networks will be serviced by the user or some system administrator without the involvement of a telecommunication operator.

02:42.000 --> 02:59.000
The next range among wireless communications is the wireless local area network, which is also based on the deployment of some networks inside the premises.

02:59.000 --> 03:18.000
The range of these networks is about 50 meters. They are usually installed in offices, university campuses, airports, restaurants, lecture halls, etc.

03:18.000 --> 03:41.000
Their basic services are standard, access to the Internet or access to the corporate network.

03:41.000 --> 03:58.000
The range of operation of such a base station is about 10 kilometers. There is a special forum for this standard communication, the so-called WiMAX forum.

03:58.000 --> 04:19.000
In some cases, the range of WiMAX can reach 50 kilometers. The main purpose of such networks is to organize a wide-band radio channel for the end-user. The basic services are standard, Internet and telephony.

04:19.000 --> 04:32.000
The next alternative to wireless computer technologies is cellular communication. They are oriented not only on the phone, but also on the Internet and data transmission.

04:32.000 --> 04:47.000
For example, GPRS, HD, 3G, HSPDI, CDMA-2000, which operates at a frequency of 450 MHz in our country.

04:47.000 --> 05:04.000
In large metropolises, CDMA-1X with EFDO standard, which is a data transmission standard at a frequency of 1.9 and 2.1 GHz, and other technologies.

05:04.000 --> 05:23.000
Despite the large variety of wireless communication networks, which continues to increase, the number of basic services is limited. They provide telephony, Internet access, network construction.

05:23.000 --> 05:49.000
In other words, the consumer can get the same service from different providers. For example, Internet access can be obtained not only by cellular communication, but also by Wi-Fi, WiMAX networks.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
In the future, WiMAX will be the next mobile network, which has recently become a full-fledged communication standard.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
The slides show the parameters, limitations, advantages and disadvantages of wireless technologies.

06:05.000 --> 06:16.000
The monthly income of Russian telecommunications companies is approximately $ 300-500 for small companies and up to $ 1,000 for medium-sized ones.

06:17.000 --> 06:29.000
The most popular services are telephone, communication and Internet access.

06:30.000 --> 06:43.000
The advantages of wireless telephony allow you to get services such as Skype, Google Talk, SIPnet.

06:43.000 --> 07:02.000
The main advantages of the use of IP telephony are well known. This is the savings on international and intercity telephone calls due to the transmission of voice traffic through the global network of data, that is, through the Internet, as well as the reduction of costs for the administration of the networks themselves, with rich functionality and other things.

07:02.000 --> 07:18.000
At the same time, VoIP technologies have significant disadvantages, mainly due to the information security. We will not analyze them, you just need to know about it.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.000
One of the modern technological breakthroughs in the field of IP telephony is the concept of unified communications.

07:28.000 --> 07:51.000
This is a new stage in the development of IP telephony. Unified telephony models use technologies such as session initiation protocol and presence control, as well as mobile solutions that simplify and unify all forms of communication, regardless of their place, time and device.

07:51.000 --> 08:06.000
Users can contact each other at any time, taking into account their preferences. And the connection can be made on any channel, regardless of the devices used.

08:06.000 --> 08:25.000
Therefore, if your provider uses the unified communication technology, you should deal with it. The most common way to access the global network is ADSL technology.

08:25.000 --> 08:53.000
In theory, it allows you to have access to the subscriber from the standard telephone line up to 7.5 Mbps. But in practice, the speed depends on many factors, from the state of the operator's node to the state of the cable, wiring, channel load, etc.

08:55.000 --> 09:19.000
Now, the country is interested in the growth of the so-called call centers. They allow companies to be client-oriented and focus on the profile activities, and to provide customer support to professional operators.

09:19.000 --> 09:42.000
The most popular service is the call center processing, i.e. a virtual office, support service, etc. What is a modern call center? Unfortunately, there is no such definition as a call center.

09:43.000 --> 09:58.000
The call center is a set of hardware, software and algorithms designed to register calls to users, received by phone or other means of communication, such as radio, PNG, etc.

09:58.000 --> 10:17.000
Their routing, task management and the output of the resulting information to the user. In fact, the call center consists not only of hardware or software, but also of employees, operators and managers.

10:17.000 --> 10:37.000
In other words, the call center is a method of processing calls and applications based on the given scenario with the subsequent data presentation for further processing, i.e. statistics, etc.

10:37.000 --> 10:57.000
The function of the call center allows you to immediately send a call to the operator who will respond to it in the best way. This avoids the operator's call transfer to the operator, the call is suspended in several lines, thus saving time for both the client and the operator.

10:57.000 --> 11:22.000
The next important task of the call center is the so-called interactive-speech interaction system, i.e. the IVR system, which allows you to automate routine procedures that have previously been spent by operators. For example, providing some information about the company in automatic mode, obtaining a current balance on the account for the client, etc.

11:22.000 --> 11:37.000
According to statistics, the use of IVR systems allows you to achieve 65-70% of the total number of calls, which can greatly affect the economy of operator's resources.

11:37.000 --> 11:57.000
Further, the call center allows you to put the client in line for service, how long the operator can wait for him, when the operator will respond to him. Statistics show that clients who receive this information expect 1.5-2 times longer than clients who do not receive this information.

11:57.000 --> 12:21.000
Also, the use of IVR systems increases the operator's discipline, thanks to the presence of monitoring tools for their work in real time. The operation of the call center in real time allows you to react quickly to changes in the flow of calls, and to serve them with the optimal amount of resources.

12:21.000 --> 12:36.000
In addition to the above-mentioned main tasks, the call center has additional advantages.

12:36.000 --> 12:49.000
1. Control of operator's quality of work, i.e. quality of service of subscribers, operator's listening in real time, recording of conversations to identify errors in the operator's work, etc.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
2. Increase of subscriber satisfaction, due to the quick and correct reaction of the call center employees to their requests.

12:58.000 --> 13:08.000
3. Increase of operator satisfaction, due to the competent organization of their workplaces, automation, or simplification of routine procedures, etc.

13:08.000 --> 13:18.000
4. Saving human resources and other costs, since the call center allows you to serve a similar number of calls to fewer agents.

13:18.000 --> 13:28.000
5. Reducing the number of unmanaged calls, and controlling the number of managers.

13:28.000 --> 13:40.000
A good operator's call center can serve incoming calls, as well as outgoing calls.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
This is a necessity when conducting sociological marketing and other population surveys.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
Or, for example, to support direct sales and service of regular clients.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
The slide shows the working scheme of such a call center.

14:01.000 --> 14:13.000
Applicants can access the call center directly, or through an electronic reception, or through an information system.

14:13.000 --> 14:24.000
Then there is a help desk, service desk, an automated processing system with applications, an electronic queue, and the call center itself.

14:24.000 --> 14:32.000
In your textbooks, there is a business case on the work of a specific call center of the company DelaJeans.

14:32.000 --> 14:41.000
This is one of the first companies in Russia to combine a call center with a full-fledged industrial CRM system.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
The center offers services to customers in the form of outsourcing.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
You can give the work to the customers as an outsourcing.

14:52.000 --> 15:15.000
Pay attention to the scenario of the conversation, and how the system allows the operator to conduct the conversation optimally in terms of the tasks,

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
and also to avoid unnecessary delay.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
Based on the scenario approved by the customer, the script of the conversation is developed.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
The screen form of the conversation is implemented in the information system.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
The conversation is displayed in accordance with the scenario, and it is correct to provide the necessary information.

15:40.000 --> 15:49.000
Pay attention to this business case. I highly recommend it to those businesses that have problems in their relations with customers.

15:49.000 --> 16:02.000
Let's look at IT products and solutions related to our government structures and authorities.

16:03.000 --> 16:11.000
Let's look at another area of IT products and solutions, namely, for the needs of the government structure and authorities.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
In any modern country, regardless of the features of its government structure, the level of economic development,

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
the state itself is the main provider of services to the population and organizations.

16:23.000 --> 16:32.000
In addition, the state is the largest consumer of products and services of both private and state corporations.

16:32.000 --> 16:41.000
The expenses of the modern Russia, the expenses of the state authorities of all levels, grow faster than the IT market itself.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
This is shown in the following slides.

16:45.000 --> 16:54.000
This is due to the delayed demand, that is, the fact that the state authorities were not automated earlier.

16:54.000 --> 17:09.000
On the other hand, large-scale projects are launched in the country, and the automation of state authorities is the primary task.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
Let's look at some of the most significant IT projects that are taking place in Russia and that need to be taken into account in business development.

17:17.000 --> 17:28.000
Also, in the interaction of B2B, B2C, G2B, G2C systems.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
All these systems intersect with any business.

17:32.000 --> 17:43.000
The current program of the Russian IT sector, one of the tasks of which is to reduce costs for entering the market of internal and external IT technologies

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
and to stimulate economic success to increase profitability.

17:47.000 --> 18:01.000
During the implementation of this program, the strategy of introducing information technologies in the state sector, including the military-industrial complex, is being implemented.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
One of the results should be the creation of prerequisites for accelerated development of electronic trading.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
There are state IT programs, such as the State Automation System of Justice.

18:16.000 --> 18:25.000
There is an IT transfer of the Federal Treasury, customs services, tax services, the creation of an electronic parliament.

18:25.000 --> 18:33.000
The work on the creation of electronic justice has already begun.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
Significant expenses are being spent on the creation of cadastral objects of Russian real estate.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
One of the key IT projects in the state is the electronic passport.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
One of the components of such a large-scale IT infrastructure for the introduction of new generation documents,

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
which will include both data transfer networks between various departments, and information storage systems,

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
that is, the equipment of storage facilities or databases of passport tables, border checkpoints, and much more.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Currently, three main biometric methods are being tested and widely used to find this electronic passport.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
This is recognition by fingerprint, recognition by the iris of the eye, and recognition by face.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
The task of transferring biometric new generation passports is closely related to two projects,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
which have been implemented since 2003.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
The first is to create a federal interdepartmental automation system for the collection and storage of information

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
about the people who are traveling through the state border, transport and cargo, the so-called border control.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
The second project is related to the development of an information system for the control of the migration situation in Russia.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
This includes the creation of a database for the account of foreign citizens and persons without citizenship.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
The development of the social sphere is also a priority for our state.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
This task is of particular importance in connection with the adoption of, for example,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
the benefit payment for the population.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
We all remember the notorious law on monetization of benefits.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
The introduction of the receiver's register and the creation of a payment accounting and control system

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
is possible only with the help of some information systems.

20:23.000 --> 20:32.000
For this, the state introduces the so-called technology of creating electronic social maps for the population.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
The concept of the system of personal population accounting, the so-called Spoon concept,

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
and the application of the technology of social maps is the first step in the direction of a unified information system

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
for the accounting of personal citizens of our country.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
The last step is to combine the information resources of 18 federal authorities,

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Tax Service, the Customs, the Ministry of Health, Social Development, and so on.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
This is due to the fact that the release of social maps is accompanied by the creation of an information infrastructure

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
that includes a database, a unified information accounting center, i.e. the benefit accounting itself, and so on.

21:10.000 --> 21:19.000
This can become a supporting link of the entire system of personal accounting, i.e. the Spoon system.

21:19.000 --> 21:26.000
The social map, its structure and processing are presented in the following two slides.

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
It contains the most important data about the owner and allows it to be identified.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Users of the social map system receive benefits in an address-based manner and with minimal costs for delivery

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
and can learn about their impressions and costs at any time.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
Social maps function in a unified environment of interdepartmental exchange of information.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
The automation of the entire process of providing social support and optimization of interdepartmental interaction

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
all this reduces costs for the service of the system and social security in general.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
Social security specialists are essentially free from routine paperwork and can deal with their own social support issues.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The electronic shopping system is interesting.

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
It has a long history in our country, but it is very well tested and works in the world.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
It is a structure of efficient shopping and delivery management using Internet technology.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
The slide shows the procedure of electronic shopping.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
The parties involved are customers, suppliers, suppliers or intermediaries,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
the organizer of the trade, providing the technical side.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
The use of the so-called e-shopping in the state sector provides a high level of equal competition

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and saving of budget funds.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
There are open and closed contests, two-stage auctions, including auctions in electronic form,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
as well as joint e-shopping.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
The world experience has shown the effectiveness of the e-shopping system.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
According to the statistics, the saving in prices and reduction in costs is on average 10%,

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
and can reach 20-40% according to the data of such projects.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
The most developed economic countries are actively financing projects

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
on the transformation of the outdated trading system into a modern e-shopping principle.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
The biggest successes in this area were achieved in Sweden, Australia, Ireland, Norway, USA, Germany.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
The Russian pilot practice of the e-shopping program has been in force for several years

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
and is based on the Federal Law No. 94 on placing orders for the supply of goods,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
the execution of work and the provision of services for state and municipal needs,

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
in which the practice of e-shopping is justified.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Currently, within the framework of the electronic Russia program,

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
an experiment on e-shopping is planned for 2010,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
and is being carried out in the regions of the country.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
At the same time, it should be noted that the regions do not wait for the instructions of the Center

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and come to e-shopping themselves.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
The port technology in the state agencies plays a greater role,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
which is usually used for collective work on documents

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
and as a single point of entry to the information services of a state agency.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
The main vector of development is the use of the portal as a platform

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
for integration with all inherited applications or previously installed information systems,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
and, first of all, with electronic document processing systems.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
The portal is the next stage after the website of the information resources of the organization,

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
which is able to provide both inside and outside the company or corporation

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
with a single point of entry to the information structure.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
One of the main advantages that the portal provides to citizens and business representatives

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
is access to various services in a single window.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You go in and get all the services.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Next, let's move on to another component of the IT environment,

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
namely, we will consider IT products and IT solutions in banks, insurance companies,

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
that is, Internet banking, electronic bank cards.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Experts define IT systems of banks and insurance companies as follows.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
As a rule, banks and insurance companies pay attention to automation in the following direction,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
namely, the automation system of banking activities,

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
then various information and analytical systems are introduced,

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
automation system in communication with customers,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
call centers, as we said, work very well in banks,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
systems of work with plastic cards,

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
electronic services such as bank client or Internet banking,

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
mobile banking, various IP technologies, telecommunications,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
information protection systems and IT structure management.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
The main role of the interaction of the bank or our corporation with the IMB

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
will be the software for managing the relationship with customers,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
that is, what is installed in the bank, in the CRM system.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
In terms of functionality, the CRM system of a bank or insurance company

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
has the following features,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
it is the management of contacts, management of sales of some bank products,

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
management of marketing activities, management of time and staff,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
as well as support and service of customers, that is, service service.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
Therefore, the CRM system, in the sphere of financial activity,

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
should provide planning of profitability indicators for each customer,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
as well as for a group of customers and even for a certain industry.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
It should also ensure the account of the relationship of the client,

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
the industry analysis of the database and the analysis of potential customers.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
One of the main factors that influence the development of IT solutions

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
and IT projects in banking and insurance activities

26:58.000 --> 27:05.000
is the satisfaction of their activities by the so-called Basel Agreement, Basel 2.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
This is an international agreement on convergence of capital measurement and capital standards,

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
which was adopted in 2004 by the countries of the Big Ten.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
This is the leading trend of banking activity in the world.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
This normative act requires a minimum size of banking capital.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
That is, the organizations are obliged to assess their operational, market and credit risks,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
as well as to reserve capital for their coverage.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
This is the Basel Axiom.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
The implementation of the basic principles of Basel 2

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
requires the creation of a complex system of risk management in each bank,

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
which efficiency will depend on competitiveness for many years to come.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
That is, the organization should be able to assess future operational,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
credit and market risks.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
If it does this correctly and accurately,

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
the less capital it needs to reserve for the coverage of these risks.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
Consequently, the bank will have more money or investment,

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
which will give it the advantage over those companies

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
that are forced to assess market risks with some reserve,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
that is, less accurately.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
This is a factor,

28:27.000 --> 28:35.000
and the Basel 2 is one of the incentives for the development of IT systems in the banking sphere.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Another factor that influences the promotion of IT products and solutions in the banking sphere

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
is the idea of ​​introducing electronic money,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
which first appeared in 1880,

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
when the American scientist Edward Bellamy suggested using prepaid cards.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
But due to technological impossibilities of the time,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
it was postponed for many years.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
Today, there are a significant number of systems of so-called electronic payments in the world,

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
the most significant of which are PayPal, Neteller, E-gold, StrongPay, Payice and many others.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
In Russia, there are noticeable CyberPlat, E-port, WebMoney, Yandex.Dengy and others.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Historically, the first Russian electronic payment system is CyberPlat,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
which was formed in 1997.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
In the most general form,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
the following electronic payment system definitions can be given.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
EPS is a technology,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
if we talk about the implementation,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
then we can say that it is a service,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
which provides a set of methods, agreements and technologies,

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
allowing to develop calculations between counteragents on data transfer networks,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
which are mostly Internet.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
There are several types of electronic payment systems in the world,

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
which can be classified into three main types.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
The first is card systems,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
the second is digital cash operators,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and the third is payment gates.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
The slide shows the payment systems that exist in Russia now.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
The first is EPS,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
which works with ordinary bank cards,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
that is, Visa, MasterCard and so on.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
The second type of systems operate with the so-called digital currency,

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
that is, an internal currency that is spinning in this payment system,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
which can be obtained from the corresponding EPS participants.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
Payment gates are a synergy of card systems and digital cash operators,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
providing a wide range of opportunities for mutual conversion

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
and payment methods for goods and services, mainly on the Internet.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Let's take a closer look at the scheme of electronic payment.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It is shown on the slide.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
The process of processing of plastic cards as a means of payment for goods and services on the Internet

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
is called Internet Acquiring.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
The main participants in electronic payment are the buyer,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
the second is the online store,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the third is the bank that issued the card,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
the fourth is the bank that carries out the initial processing of the transaction

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
and provides the entire range of operations with cards,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
which are implemented by partners.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
The fifth is the payment server,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
that is, the electronic payment system itself,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
which provides security for payment and much more.

31:22.000 --> 31:31.000
Thus, the card electronic payment system is the guarantor of safe transport of card data

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
to the processing center of the Bank Acquire.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
The Russian market for bank cards is now developing rapidly.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
According to the Central Bank,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
the average annual growth of the number of bank cards in Russia

31:43.000 --> 31:50.000
in the period 2001-2005 was about 50% per year.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
It is shown on the slide.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
The idea of digital cash is the work of David Chaume,

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
with his technology E-Cash,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
that is, E-Cash.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
It is promising,

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
despite some uncertainty of its legal status,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
that is, the status of the system itself.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Strictly speaking,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
it cannot even be called an electronic payment system,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
that is, it is not quite correct to call it that,

32:23.000 --> 32:29.000
since in this system it operates as some kind of virtual units.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Well, WebMoney, for example, calls it a system of property rights,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
and Yandex.Money calls it a prepaid financial product.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
At the same time,

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
this payment system takes a very active part in e-commerce,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
even in the commodity-money circulation of the country.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
At the same time, their activities,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
in fact, are not regulated by the Central Financial Institute,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
that is, by the Central Bank.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
And it is still unclear how and where these electronic payment systems will develop,

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
if the Central Bank decides to put them in order.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
As of June 2006,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
the number of stores that accepted WebMoney, Yandex.Money,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
or the credit pilot system,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
was 2,772,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
950 and 126, respectively.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
The slide shows

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
which digital cash systems

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
are used by certain online stores,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
that is, the number of online stores

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
that belong to certain digital cash systems.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
The textbook considers the business case of a digital cash system,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
for example, WebMoney and its corresponding web resource.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
This system is one of the oldest payment systems of the Internet,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
since 1998.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
WebMoney provides real-time payment

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
by means of account units,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
WebMoney's title signs.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
The management of the title signs is carried out by users

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
using the client program WM Keeper.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
The developers, the owners, the administrators of WebMoney

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
and provide its organizational and technological integrity

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
are WM Transfer,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
registered in Belize,

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
an offshore zone that borders Guatemala and Mexico.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
The management company is the law firm

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
UAB Dixa Baltic,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
registered in Lithuania.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
The technical support service of WebMoney in Russia

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
is the Accounting Center.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
This company is located in Moscow.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
If you like to work with this payment system

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
or if it is suitable for sale and purchase,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
you should pay attention to it

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
and adopt it in your business.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
The third type of payment systems, payment gates,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
are often used as a prepaid card,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
providing the possibility of transferring

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
the payment data to the payment system.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
They can work with both card systems and WebMoney.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
The legal nature of payment gates

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
is a symbiosis of card and digital cash.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
It requires the account of the functionality of both systems.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
In these systems, the client does not buy any digital cash

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
and does not operate with his credit card account,

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
but receives a registered payment from the payment system.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
The payment system is a system of payment gates

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
that does not operate with its own credit card account,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
but receives its own account in the payment system.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
The user receives a large number of services

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
that are possible with this account,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
and the payment system operator earns on the commission.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
The advantages of payment gates

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
are a large number of payment methods,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
both for the buyer and the seller.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
One of the disadvantages is that the rights and responsibilities

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
of the user are not guaranteed.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
In addition, the use of several payment schemes

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
and exchanges between different payment systems

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
significantly increases the risks of using these payment gates.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
So, today we have some paradoxes.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
For more than 12 years,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
the existence of digital cash

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
or the very idea of ​​electronic money

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
has not been clearly defined.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
The most common definition of digital cash

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
is the storage of some monetary value

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
through a software device.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
In the vast majority of cases,

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
a regular personal computer

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
with installed client software

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
for access to the wallet of this electronic payment system

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
and access to the Internet is used.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
The manifestation of this is a digital currency

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
that is not used for payment.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
The manifestation of this legal paradox

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
is that the operator, the owner, the guarantor,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
etc. is issuing checks on the showman.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
However, according to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
the check is not issued to securities.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
The circulation of this kind of securities

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
is not regulated by the law on the market of securities.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
It is not regulated by the law on the market of securities.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
It is regulated by the specific position of the Bank of Russia.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Another example of the paradoxical existence of electronic money

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
is that the issuance of prepaid financial products

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
does not affect the increase in the money mass in the country.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
In fact, money does not appear in circulation.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Therefore, the use of prepaid cards

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
by our corporation is possible

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
without the permission of the Bank of Russia.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
The bank does not have the permission

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
to use electronic payment systems

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
operating with digital cash.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
However, the owners of some electronic payment systems

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
operate with digital cash

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
are somewhat deceptive

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
when it comes to their own currency

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
used in the system of prepaid financial products.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
From the point of view of the formulation,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
this is really so,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
but if you look at the wiring of such payment systems,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
you can see that there is no prepaid financial product.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
you can see that there is no prepaid financial product.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
In fact, the so-called advance payment is implemented.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
In fact, the so-called advance payment is implemented.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Roughly speaking,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
when a metro ticket is purchased,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
the consumer clearly and unambiguously knows

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
how many trips he can make.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
He changes his cash for this card.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Obviously, if I purchase some title marks

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
in the case of electronic cash,

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
in the case of electronic cash,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
we will not have any agreement.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
I will not know how many trips

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
I can make with this payment.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
In fact, I just gave them money,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
made some advance payment for subsequent services.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Nevertheless,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
the existence and functioning of electronic money

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
in the world and in our country cannot be denied.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Their growth is increasing.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Their growth is increasing.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
The problem must be solved.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
It is not known where it will lead.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
The only thing that is known is that

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
the Central Bank of Singapore

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
has started the emission of digital cash.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
It has started the management of digital money.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
I think that in the near future

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
all banks will also switch to digital money.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
The last IT environment

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
I would like to focus on

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
is to devote to the solutions

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
and products for the information

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
of such communities.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
For example, education.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
The success of national programs,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
commercial and non-commercial

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
educational organizations in the competitive environment

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
depends on intellectual capital.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
The functioning of the business

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
also depends on the presence

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and development of intellectual capital.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
The company's intellectual capital

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
and the structure of the organization

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
are related to it.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
The human capital

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
and the structure of the organization

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
are related to it.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
The human capital includes the knowledge,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
intelligence, competence, and connections

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
of the employees of the corporation.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
The structure of the organization

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
includes the information exchange system,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
the application of common knowledge,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
the management system and processes

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
that allow to concentrate on the strategy

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
and adapt to the changing business environment.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
The external structural capital

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
is also a stable connection of the organization

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
with external partners, suppliers, intermediaries, clients, etc.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Today, not only labor and capital

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
are the source of profit,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
but also the innovative activity of the entrepreneur,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
the idea, knowledge, information, including electronic information,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
is an integral and important part

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
of the production process and organization of the enterprise.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
The exchange of information with the client,

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
the consumer, suppliers, and competitors.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Therefore, the need to switch from the traditional education system

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
to an open and continuous education system

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
is a key factor in the organization of the enterprise.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
The managers themselves must reprogram themselves

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
in the process of changing the business environment

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
and changing the business from its goals and strategies.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
The most characteristic features of this system

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
should be the ability to choose the form, content, and pace of education,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
the availability of territorially distributed sources of information,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
and remote learning,

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
including the availability of laboratory equipment

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
for educational and scientific purposes.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
The final result of the informationization of the educational system

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
is the provision of education

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
through the so-called e-learning or remote learning.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
At the same time, any form of educational process

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
can be understood under the system of remote learning,

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
when teachers and employees share significant distances.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
In addition to access to educational materials,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
such a system of organizing educational processes

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
can be used to establish communication with the teacher

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
and to obtain consultation in online mode,

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
as well as to check the knowledge of the end of the education.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
The slides show a single digital environment

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
and the educational process with remote learning.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
As for e-learning materials

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
that are used in the educational process

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
in universities, middle schools, and schools,

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
they can be divided into two large groups.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
The first group is the one that is used in the educational process.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
It is a group of students,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
who are using the Internet.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
The main advantage of the local ones

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
is their autonomy,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
regardless of the Internet connection.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
But the drawback is simple.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
They quickly get old and have to be renewed.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
This drawback is the lack of an online access system.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
The main advantage of the local ones

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
is the ability to connect to the global network

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
and to have the latest information.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Other requirements for educational materials

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
are formed on the Internet

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
depending on the way they are used.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Educational materials can be used

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
not only for educational portals,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
but also for a number of sites

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
The main components of e-learning

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
are shown on the slide.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
The main components of e-learning

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
are shown on the slide.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
The main components of e-learning

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
are shown on the slide.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
According to the analytics,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
computers will be able to translate

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
from other languages to real-time

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
according to the right understanding

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
and organization of effective interaction.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
according to the right understanding

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
and organization of effective interaction.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
This will make the education market global.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Any document, any knowledge

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
will be available to everyone.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
will be available to everyone.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Then the workers of the enterprises

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
will have the opportunity

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
to use educational materials

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
from any university in the world.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
from any university in the world.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
This will eliminate the obstacle

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
of the lack of educational content

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
on the way of the distance development.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
We have a long distance between the content

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
and the lack of it.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
The problem of the translation

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
of existing paper textbooks

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
into e-learning is understood

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
and adopted within the framework

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
of a certain state project

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
on the creation of e-libraries.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
and adopted within the framework

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
of a certain state project

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
on the creation of e-libraries.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
The program of wide use of information technology

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
in the field of healthcare

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
is provided by the creation of an e-card

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
of the patient integrated into all systems

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
in the field of medicine and social protection.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
in the field of medicine and social protection.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
The second is the provision of accurate information

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
from all points of the healthcare system.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Further, the management of medical information

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
is necessary for the safety of the patient

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
and the quality of services,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
the improvement of the organization

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
of medical services,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
the control over chronic diseases,

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
access to medical services,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
improving financial control

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
and tariffing of medical services,

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
and satisfaction of requests

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
for the healthcare system.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
The third is the implementation of the

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
medical database as an alternative

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
to the traditional paper document.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
The medical database is an alternative

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
to the traditional paper document.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
We all know that in our medical records

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
it is often impossible to understand

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
how the employees use different recording systems.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Many medical institutions have switched

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
to electronic methods of history of diseases

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
and other documentation.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
The optimization of medical institutions

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
usually begins with the implementation

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
of financial or administrative IT solutions.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
That is, solutions for the registration

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
or some specific departments are implemented.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
There are anemiologists, anesthesiologists, etc.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
IT providers do not recommend

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
to go straight to the complex optimization,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
but to automate the medical institution

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
with careful and not sudden steps.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
The slide shows how to do it.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
The technological cycle of the medical institution

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
and how to start the automation

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
of hospitals or clinics.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
First, the automation of routine processes

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
is carried out, i.e. the organization

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
of joint services, work and services,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
and in general, the regular activities

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
of all medical institutions,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
including the transition to electronic maps,

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
which allow to store data in a single database

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
of diagnosis and treatment of patients.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Then the integration of medical and financial blocks,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
the management of the medical institution

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
and the improvement of the strategic direction

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
of the medical institution.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
As an example, we can give a personal monitoring system,

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
the so-called BodyCamp.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
This is a solution of the Swedish-Finnish telecommunication company

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
TeleSennere together with Hewlett Packard.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
The slide shows how BodyCamp is used as a medium

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
for monitoring the medical institution

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
BodyCamp is used as a medium

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
for data transfer via cellular channels

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
and is primarily aimed at patients

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
suffering from cardiovascular diseases

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
or, for example,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
for the adaptation of patients to diabetes,

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
asthma, and so on.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
In addition to medical sensors,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
the BodyCamp system is equipped with location determination tools

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
that allow to transmit the patient's exact coordinates

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
to the doctor along with the information.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
All asthmatics and hypertonics

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
can even have such a device.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Meanwhile, in foreign hospitals

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
the so-called integrated IT solution for doctors

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
is already actively used,

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
which is a universal terminal device

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
used by the staff for rapid access to medical data.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
This is a so-called specialized tablet computer

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
equipped with the minimum necessary

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
control organs and broad communication capabilities

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
including wireless technology.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
In addition, these devices are equipped with input devices

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
for updating patient data

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
during the treatment,

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
for example, with a built-in camera.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
The last industry I would like to talk about

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
is the housing and utilities industry.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
All businesses rent or own some real estate.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Therefore, modern IT solutions

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
and IT information products

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
for housing and utilities

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
can be of interest to them

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
and the following services can be implemented in them.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
In fact, this is the availability of static information

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
about the completed utility payments for any period of time.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Further, the availability of static information

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
about the expenses of the units of resources

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
such as water, gas, electricity, and Internet traffic.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Further, the possibility of forecasting and controlling

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
the expenses of resources.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Further, the increase in customer information

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
about the upcoming changes,

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
for example, changes in tariffs,

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
service provisioning conditions, and so on.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Further, the availability of electronic and mobile notifications

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
about the payment of the new account.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
The report on the stage of execution

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
of the payment of the account.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
The implementation of these solutions

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
in the housing and utilities industry

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
allows us to reduce the costs

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
of the production and sale of services,

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
reduce the costs of processing payments

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
and organize an accurate account of the services provided.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
It also contributes to the effective document turnover,

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
optimization of accounting,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
data storage and analysis,

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
as well as improves financial and resource planning

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
and budgeting.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
We all, especially in Moscow,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
live under the project of creating

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
a single IT center for housing and utilities,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
which has changed the forms of contractual relations

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
in the city housing and utilities system.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
The following three slides show

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
the scheme of interaction of the ERC supplier population,

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
the full cycle of communal billing,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
and the scheme of organization of payment acceptance

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
in our Moscow.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
In ERC, there is an opportunity

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
to perform approximately the same task.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
The first is to organize payment acceptance

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
for the services of any suppliers.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
The second is to use a variety of payment methods,

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
i.e. own class points of housing and utilities,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
banks, mail, ATM, kiosks,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Internet, mobile phones,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
interactive kiosks.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Further, to automate and unify the work

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
and ensure the functioning in the online mode

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
of providing these services.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
To develop centralized billing for utilities

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
according to approved algorithms.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
To track the work of any payment acceptance point.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
To view the list of payments

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
for specific payers

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
and identify non-payers.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
To perform the accumulation and processing of data

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
on the central server

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
for the preparation of reports and analytics.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
To provide accountability

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
for the various levels of management,

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
i.e. the level of management of the household,

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
administration of the city, etc.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
All these tasks can be solved

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
only with the help of modern software,

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
which we have already passed in this course.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Even the implementation of ERP system

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
as a household is possible.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
This solution may solve the main problem

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
of our Russian household,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
namely, the problem of non-payments.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
We all know that non-payments

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
are a bitch of our system.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
It does not allow to serve

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
or develop the industry efficiently.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Therefore, the implementation of billing systems

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
allows to automate the acceptance

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
and processing of cash payments from the population.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
To create a network of points

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
for accepting cash and cashless payments

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
working online with the central process

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
through the payment acceptance point and the Internet.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Considering these solutions for the housing and utilities industry,

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
it should be mentioned about the technology

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
of three-dimensional visualization of geographical data

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
and the use of space photography

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
and network Internet technologies

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
based on free applications,

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
that is, geobrowsers,

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
which allow to create complex virtual housing.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
With the help of geobrowser, it can do this.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
In conclusion, I would like to say a few words.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
We have only considered the main concepts

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
and their implementation in the form of business cases,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
which have already been implemented by entrepreneurs

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
in the field of information.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
It is surprising how much people need to know

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
to be considered experts in a certain field.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
This is especially true for the field of information technologies.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
It is even more surprising how quickly

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
the knowledge is changing

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
to stay in the topic.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
We talked about the expanding digital universe.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
According to the estimates of some analytical companies,

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
the amount of information that humanity has

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
will double every 5 years,

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
and in 2020 it will double every 72 days.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Today, a manager can no longer rely on his memory

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
and the ability to mechanically remember facts.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
In each subject area,

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
he needs a general methodology, guidance, and concept,

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
which would turn facts and data into information and knowledge,

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
and on which he could rely

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
when analyzing some new events.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
In the field of information technologies,

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
leading companies release new IT products and IT systems

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
almost every day and provide some new services.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Any business manager needs to have IT skills

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
and be able to distinguish between the two.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
He needs to be able to distinguish between the two

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
and to distinguish between the two.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
This course is a guide for modern IT concepts.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
The last slide shows the demand for a certain IT concept

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
depending on its maturity on the market.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
As you can see,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
not all concepts reach the stage of maturity.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
The most important thing is to be able to

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
understand the concept and the concept of the business.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
I will be glad if this course will help you

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
to understand your IT skills,

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
to find the right concept for your business,

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
to rely on it, to master it,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
and to be successful in your business.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
I wish you all the best!
