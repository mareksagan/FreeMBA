00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello, colleagues! My name is Natalia Volodina.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
I am the Director of the Silvano Fashion Group's Personnel Holdings.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Today we are going to talk about the adaptation of the personnel.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I will share my knowledge and experience gained during my work in Silvano,

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
in the Moscow Nut Company, after participating in a number of consulting projects on this topic.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
What is the adaptation of the personnel?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
No matter how expensive the search for a new employee is, the next necessary step is its adaptation.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Sometimes the absence of a system of adaptation in a company or at least a number of elementary adaptation tools

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
leads to the absence of all the efforts made in advance.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
Consultants say that about 80% of people who quit their jobs in the first six months of their work

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
are the ones who make decisions about it in the first two weeks.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The question is why this happens.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
There are several reasons.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
One of them is that the reality of the new employee is sometimes not in line with what we told him during the interview.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
The second reason is either the informational vacuum that the employee is in,

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
not even his inability, but our inability to provide him with the necessary information that he needs,

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
or vice versa, there is too much information that the employee is lost in it.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
The adaptation system is one of the elements of the personnel management system.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Nevertheless, we pay attention to it very often on the residual principle.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
We train and develop people, we evaluate them, we form a corporate culture.

01:41.000 --> 01:51.000
Nevertheless, the main goal of the personnel adaptation program is to reduce the costs of the organization.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It is important to remember about this economy.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
What is the reason for the reduction of the costs of the organization?

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
The first reason is that our new employee is more likely to take office.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
If an employee is more likely to take office, it means that he is going to the level of performance that is necessary in his profession.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Therefore, the first is performance.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The second is a reduction in the number of marriages.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
If we approach the adaptation of an employee seriously, we train him, explain everything that he needs,

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
then the number of possible mistakes in the first days, weeks, months of work is reduced.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
The second, in addition to the accelerated process of entering the position, is a reduction in the level of flow of personnel.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
The number of people who do not pass the probation period is reduced, as well as those who leave our company in the first six months of work.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Why do we divide probation period and first six months of work?

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
The probation period is a period when not only the employee, but also the company undergoes a test before the employee.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Here, it is easier for the employee to resign, and it is easier for the company to part with him.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Nevertheless, a number of employees, even realizing that they do not want to continue their career in our companies,

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
do not leave the company during these three months, so as to, as they explain, not to spoil their record in their workbooks.

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
Therefore, it is important to understand that one of the indicators that we track when talking about adaptation is how many people have been fired in the first six months, or even a year of work.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
Such dismissals can be consequences of improperly adapted systems and improperly used tools.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Of course, there are a number of benefits for the company and for the employee from the implementation of the adaptation system.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Let's see what benefits each party has.

03:45.000 --> 03:59.000
If we talk about the employee, then he is in the presence of a certain ideal situation, which we will strive for, and we would like this system to be in our companies.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
If we talk about the employee, then the first benefit is to receive complete information that is required for work.

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
It is not a search for something, to look up something, someone retold, someone knows, or someone guessed and shared with the employee.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It is exactly the complete objective information that is necessary for work.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
The next benefit is a decrease in the level of uncertainty and anxiety.

04:23.000 --> 04:36.000
Psychologists who study the impact of stress in our lives determine that changing jobs is one of the major stress factors.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
According to one of the studies, it is in the third place.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
In the first place, it is the death of a loved one, and in the second place, it is divorce.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
In the third place, it is changing jobs.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
It is in such a situation that our task is to support a person.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
The next benefit is to improve the satisfaction of work and to develop a positive attitude towards the company.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
This is also a benefit for the company, but it is also important for the employee to understand that the choice he made is correct.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
Then the employee learns the norms of corporate culture, builds schemes of interaction with colleagues, and always receives feedback.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
This is his benefit if the adaptation system exists.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
What are the benefits for the company?

05:14.000 --> 05:28.000
First of all, it is the mechanism of assessing the professional and management competencies of the employee, his potential as a result of the first months of work.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
When after a few months we understand who joined us, what he can do, what he can do.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Maybe he was overrated at the entrance, when he was selected, he sold himself well, as we say.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Maybe he was underrated, and our task is to correct this mistake.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
The next is the identification of shortcomings of the existing selection system.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
Very often, in the first few months, those people who should not have joined our company are fired.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Because we made a mistake when selecting.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And, accordingly, with a built-in adaptation system, we will also see.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
The next is the possibility of planning the career of a new employee.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
In no case should we forget that, in addition to this, we develop, let's say, institutes of mentorship in the company.

06:19.000 --> 06:34.000
Leaders, in the department of which employees come, develop their management competencies related to training, with the provision of feedback, and so on.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
This is very important.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
But, colleagues, do not forget that these are just benefits.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
The main goal is to reduce the costs of the organization.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
The question is about the adaptation system, what it is needed for, and, most importantly, when.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
As we know from the economic theory, the company goes through several stages during its development.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The first stage is the formation of the company.

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
At the stage of formation, when the company is still small, when all acquaintances, when all one team, when there is a sense of belonging.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
Most likely, there may not be a person who is engaged in the adaptation of new employees, because employees are poured into this team, sometimes a happy team.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
But time passes.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
And at the stage of formation, it really is so.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
Everyone is still together, often sit in some united room, if we are talking about small companies.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And a person, coming to the company, immerses himself in this environment, is imbued.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Everything is available, everything is within reach.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But time passes, companies develop.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And there is a period of intense growth.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
New employees appear.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
At the time of new employees, more, more, more and more.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And here you have to grab your head, you have to do something.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Because what happens?

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
What can be the negative consequences of this growth for the company culture?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
First of all, information can be lost.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Previously, some employee was irreplaceable, he knew everything.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Without him, the company stopped.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
He did not go on vacation, he worked without weekends, because he was a source.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
New employees appear.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
It is important to take knowledge from this source, which will be necessary for work.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
If suddenly our key employee resigns, then knowledge is lost with him.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Therefore, the first is the loss of knowledge.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
It is necessary not to allow it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
The second.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
The second may be the emergence of subcultures.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
Due to the fact that newcomers unite, as if old people are a little far away, they do not pay much attention to them.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
And somehow newcomers first went to have lunch, then did something else together.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
And over time, the corporate culture of the company that was, it begins to blur.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It does not blur on purpose.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
We must decide for ourselves whether we need it.

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
But it is important to remember that, I repeat again, the emergence of subcultures and the blurring of corporate culture is another consequence.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
The absence of an adaptation system during the period of intense growth.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Therefore, during this period of growth, it is necessary to think about the tools, to work out them.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
What will it be?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
A book for an employee?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Will it be some kind of introductory course?

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
But some elements that do not require special costs, such as providing a new employee to the team.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Who is he? What will he do? Who will he interact with?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Providing a new employee to the team.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Who is responsible for what? Who is addressed on what issues?

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
It does not take a lot of time and effort, but sometimes it does not happen in our companies.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
An employee comes to his department, he knows who is sitting on the right, who is sitting opposite, who is sitting on his left side.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
He does not represent people from other departments at all, who are, let's say, unfamiliar characters to him.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
This is a period of intense growth, and it is necessary to think about it.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Once again, who should think about it?

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
The staff may not be in the service, or there may be one manager per staff.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It is important to remember this about the linear manager, the one whose department employees come to.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
The next stage is stabilization.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
At the stage of stabilization, everything is already measured.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Newcomers come, old people leave.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
This is already a normal, usual, everyday process.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
At this stage, it is already appropriate to talk about improving the efficiency of the system.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Maybe something that we did then, during the period of intense growth, is no longer necessary.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
Maybe the employee's book, which was created two years ago, has become outdated, and no one looks at it.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
At this stage, we are talking about how to improve the efficiency of adaptation tools.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
If we have an Internet site with a page for our newcomers, we need to see if newcomers go there, and who goes there.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Maybe we do it for ourselves, as it is sometimes said, when the staff does something for themselves,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
and its internal clients and other employees do not use it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
If this is so, it is sad.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And this should be thought about and checked.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
At the fourth stage, the stage of decline or crisis, if the company reaches it,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
and does not go through the stage of rapid growth again,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
the tools lose their efficiency, they do not update, they begin to age,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
and it seems that something was, and something is.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And sometimes this leads to a kind of refusal.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Therefore, colleagues, thinking about it, I think you have repeatedly thought about it,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
in our companies, in fact, how, is there a system, what is the system?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Always keep in mind that the tools that we adopt,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
whether it is adaptation of staff, whether it is training, assessment or something else,

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
the tools must correspond to the level, that is, the stage of development of our company, which our organization is experiencing.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
Adaptation of staff

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Colleagues, let's talk about such concepts as adaptation period and trial period.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
In literature, these concepts are often found as synonyms.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What is it really?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
It is important to remember that the trial period is a legal concept.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
And in our country, the duration of the trial period is regulated by the Labor Code.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Adaptation period is something else.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
What do specialists say?

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
Psychologists say that the adaptation period can last from two months to two years.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
The period is insane.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
What are we talking about today?

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
About two years, two months, two weeks.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
Colleagues, the question that we should answer in our companies is

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
how long can we shorten the adaptation period of new employees.

13:08.000 --> 13:17.000
Very often, in Russian practice, we equate the adaptation period to the trial period.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It is important to understand whether it is always so.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
What is three months?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
On the one hand, it is not enough to fully adapt to the team.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
On the other hand, let's look at the organization.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Our task is to look at it with such eyes.

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
Three months pass, and the employee, to whom we have taken on a number of tasks, has not yet reached the level of its performance.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
How many companies are ready to lose?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
The company is losing money in this period.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
The employee does not finish something, does not work on it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It is not because he does not want to or does not know how to.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
It is because he does not succeed or some conditions have not been created.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
This issue must be determined within each organization.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
It depends on the level of the employee, on the position he occupies.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
Today we will talk about the features of adaptation of different categories of employees.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
It is important to understand what adaptation activities, what period we take for each of the categories.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
There are a number of employees, if they are working employees, who come to ordinary positions, for example, in the production department, in the workshop.

14:29.000 --> 14:41.000
We say that three days, a week, two weeks, no more, because after two weeks we need the process to go and the production not to lose its effectiveness.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
If this is an office specialist, a marketing department, let it be a personnel department,

14:47.000 --> 14:55.000
we take a slightly longer period and we are ready to wait a month, wait two, so that the employee reaches the level that is required of him,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
and we are ready to learn him along the way, explaining, showing, and so on.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
This should not be a chaotic process, it should be planned in advance.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
We must understand what, when, from whom we will demand.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
Let's talk about when our efforts to adapt the employee begin.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
You can highlight a number of stages.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
Colleagues, these stages are not a kind of a prescribed truth when we say that do only this way, not in any case.

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
These are some stages that you define in your company for your employees and say, it is so convenient for us, because it is clear to us.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
So, if we talk about the stages.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
The first is what we do before the start of the work of a new employee in the company.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
What can it be?

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
It can be, first of all, the preparation of the workplace, the preparation of the plan of his work.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
What is the preparation of the workplace?

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
This is the installation of a computer, at least, this is the search for the place where the employee will sit.

16:00.000 --> 16:09.000
Often, when an employee comes, we say, sit here, we ordered furniture, or we order now, what color do you want?

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Most likely, this is not about caring for some color preferences of employees, but about the fact that it was not done.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
And the first days, when the same impression is formed, and the same relationship between the company and the employee begins to tie up,

16:25.000 --> 16:34.000
the employee sits at someone's side or at the place of the colleague who is on vacation and feels a little uncomfortable.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
So, this is the first thing we do before he appears.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The next period is the introductory one.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
This is the first day of the work of a new employee.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
We must understand what should happen to him on the first day, who he will meet, when he will meet, what to learn.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
And not just a registration in the personnel department, which is very often limited.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
It seems that he came, he was told a little about the company, the instruction was definitely carried out in safety techniques,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
well, it seems that he was introduced to the course of the case.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Colleagues, this is not enough.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Therefore, the first day of a new employee, he must be prepared.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
We will talk about who should do this, the staff or the personnel, the line manager, the mentor.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
It depends on the size of the company, on its structure.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Now we are talking about what it should be.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
The next period is the introductory one.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This is the first week of work in the company.

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
These are the most intense weeks in terms of getting information from the person who came to us.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
How we will give him, in what volume, in what terms, in what pace, depends on how he perceives it.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
Therefore, at this stage, there may be some introductory courses or welcome training.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Welcome training, which we will also talk about.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
These are the instructors, this is communication with the managers, with the key employees with whom he will interact.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
This is work with databases.

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
This can be an intranet database, if we have placed all the necessary documentation for work there, or something in print.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
This is already work according to the plan that is made for him.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
The next is the introduction to the position.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
This is the biggest period.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And most often it is occupied by professional training.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
When an employee begins to learn during work, interacting with an instructor or a direct manager.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Or when we organize a specific training for him.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
If we are talking about the operator of the call center,

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
who is required to go to training in order to learn the standards that are adopted in the company.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
The next period is the evaluation and final one.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
The moment of the end of the trial period,

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
we have already discussed that the trial period and the adaptation period are often compared.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
This process must be somehow noted, because the results of the work must be summed up.

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
How does the employee work, is all the information brought to him, how does he perform his direct duties.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
The evaluation period is mandatory.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
This does not mean that this is a kind of event or event.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
This is a conversation between an employee and a manager.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Very often this is not the case.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
It seems that three months have passed, it seems that he is working.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Let him work further, and then we'll see.

19:36.000 --> 19:43.000
Nevertheless, this period of dialogue, a period of conversation for an employee who has ceased to be new,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
he has already worked for several months.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
This is a period and an opportunity to ask questions to your direct manager.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
For the manager, this is an opportunity to give feedback.

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
Let's talk about the aspects of adaptation, which are discussed by specialists and authors in the field of personnel management.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
There are four of them.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
The organizational aspect, the social-psychological, the professional and the psychophysiological.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
What is it? What is it really?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
In fact, everything is very simple.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
The first is the inclusion of an employee in an organization.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The second is his inclusion in a team.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And the third is his inclusion in a profession.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Let's look at these aspects in order.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
So, organizational adaptation.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
Organizational adaptation is responsible for the employee getting answers to his questions

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
related to the activities of the organization in which he got.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
What are the strategic goals and priorities of the company?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
How is management carried out?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
How are business processes established?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
How are decisions made?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
What is the structure?

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
How is the meeting, meeting and so on?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
How does the organization live?

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Each organization has its own rules and standards.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
It is important to have an opportunity to provide this information to the employee.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
Very often it happens, let's say, by instinct.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
The employee begins to absorb and look at the sides.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
What are the strategic goals?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Look on the Internet, answer a colleague at work.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Or read a newspaper if it is a large public company.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
In fact, these are the answers that the company has.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
And they should be, let's say, formalized.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
The employee should have the opportunity to familiarize himself with them.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
It's great if the company has local regulatory acts

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
dedicated to, let's say, how the budgeting process is going on.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
This is very important for the line manager or the head of the department

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
who comes to the company.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
But he should learn this from some documents.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
And not that someone told him something, by the way.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
That by the 20th of the coming month we are making a budget,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
send it, there is a vote, a budget committee and so on.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
This is not the information that needs to be absorbed from the air.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Colleagues, it should be.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
The next is social and psychological adaptation.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
This is getting to know the corporate culture of the company.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
This is an answer for the employee to the question

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
what are they, what is the company, what will I be like.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
This is a very important aspect, because it is a joining of the team.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
In any team, in any department, there are already their own norms,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
their own rules, their own standards.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What do we do? We are like this.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And this is what the employee should familiarize himself with.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
How do we live? Why do we live like this?

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Because if we are talking about a joint professional life,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
this person who came to us should share it.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
The next is professional adaptation or getting a job.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
This aspect can also be called pre-training.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
That is, acquiring the knowledge and skills that the employee lacks.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
It is not a secret that very often we take people who,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
we say, this is our person.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
It's okay that he doesn't know a little, we will teach him.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
If we decided to do this during the interview, then we must teach him.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
He should not have time to learn by himself,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
but we must do something for him.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
We must organize some courses or seminars.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
If we do not have such an opportunity, because we are a small company,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
then we must include him in the project, where he should understand.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
We must offer him to work with a mentor.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
It does not matter that the mentor is not a dedicated department,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
but his neighbor.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
The neighbor, on the other hand, knows his mission and mentorship.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
He prompts, explains and does it purposefully.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
And not just like that, let's say, in a friendly way, somehow in a neighborly way.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Therefore, this is a professional adaptation, pre-training.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Sometimes such concepts are included in this aspect,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
that it seems that the employee came prepared.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
For example, we are a large trading company,

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
we hire a supervisor, a specialist from the side with experience of working in such a position.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
But it is important to remember that the supervisor,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
as a linear leader of the trading team,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
will train managers by personnel.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
And it is important that he teaches them the way we teach in the company,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and not the way he was taught somewhere, sometime.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
Therefore, during the period of professional adaptation,

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
we send this supervisor to some seminars,

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
or he gets acquainted with some methodological materials

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
on the topic with which he will work.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
That is, he gets acquainted with the standards,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and learns from them.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
The next is psychophysiological adaptation.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
In fact, this is the adaptation of an employee

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
to a certain and often different from the usual working regime.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
What can it be?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Let's look at some examples.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
It can be a shift schedule.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
A young specialist comes to us who has never worked a shift.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Why did we decide that he would be easy to work at night?

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
This is a different way of life for those people

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
who work 2 hours in 2 days, 3 hours in 3 days, it does not matter how.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Day and night, they change places.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
It is difficult. Can an employee work like that?

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
The next is a shifted work schedule.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Someone starts working very early, and finishes earlier.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Or starts later, and finishes later.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
It is important to understand whether a person is ready for this.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Of course, we remember this in case we have such conditions,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
and we take people in such conditions.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
The next is an unregulated working day.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Colleagues, we all say that we are ready to work unregulated.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Internal readiness is one thing, internal possibilities are another.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
The next is a long business trip.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
If we take a person and say that he will have business trips,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
he says, super, I always dreamed of seeing my country,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
neighboring countries, and so on.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
It is necessary to understand what will happen in a month,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
in 2, in 3 of his long business trips.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
For one, it will really be super,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
and for another, it will be some kind of tension,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
some kind of dissatisfaction that will accumulate, accumulate, accumulate, and accumulate.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It is also worth thinking about.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
The next example is, let's say, a project work.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
People who work in a measured mode,

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
solving tasks, or, let's say, similar tasks, day by day,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
do not always fit into the project.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Projects are very often characterized by burning deadlines,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
when before a certain deadline we are straining,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
working day and night, but we are doing something.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Again, it is not for everyone, it can be comfortable and convenient.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
These are just a number of examples,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
there may be something else in your companies.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Think, look around, look at what is there,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
from the point of view of the labor regime in our case,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
if we are talking about psychological, physiological adaptation,

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
something that can cause some kind of tension,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
not even dissatisfaction.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Sometimes an employee says, I liked working with you,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
thanks, good team, good company,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
but I can't, it's difficult for me,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
health, something else, and so on.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
So keep this in mind.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
If we are talking about the adaptation system today,

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
then we must understand that this is a kind of a set of elements.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
And the management of the adaptation system involves several stages.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Colleagues, adaptation as a corporate culture,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
even if we do not do it,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
we cannot say that we do not have a corporate culture.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
It is as it has developed, it is.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
We also cannot say that we do not have adaptation.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
Employees somehow join the team, the company, and so on.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So, this is how it happened,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
a kind of chaotic process, it exists.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It exists now, in any company, you too.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And if you start thinking about it,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
first, analyze the current situation.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Look what is there.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
This is a very good advice for those personnel specialists

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
who come to a new job, to a new company themselves.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
By the way, very often in literature you can find thoughts

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
that a bootlegger is without boots.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
When HR or a personnel manager comes to a company,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
no one is doing his adaptation,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
he somehow adapts himself.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
This really happens.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But, thank God, not in all companies.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Therefore, if you are the same personnel manager

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
who came to the company,

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
well, do not think about yourself.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
If you have already come to the conditions you are in,

28:42.000 --> 28:49.000
look around, look how other employees are adapting to your company.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It will be easy for you to do it,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
because you are a newbie yourself in such a situation.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Therefore, the first thing is to analyze the current situation.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
We looked, analyzed.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
The next thing is to determine the procedures that are really needed.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
The determination of the procedure, colleagues,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
depends on the stage of the company's development,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
on the goals in the area of personnel management.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
After that, we determined the third stage.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We develop and implement.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
And the fourth stage is the assessment of efficiency.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Because you can develop and implement a lot.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
How effective is it for us?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
So, let's go in order.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Analysis of the current situation.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
What are the auditing methods?

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
When, with very often limited time resources,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
when there are no budgets,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
you can still do something.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Let's see what methods are.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
The first is the analysis of documents and local regulatory acts

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
that regulate adaptation procedures.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This is really a method.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
But it is important to understand,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and in my experience I have encountered situations

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
when there is a situation of adaptation.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You think, that's cool.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
In life, you ask questions, and they say,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
well, there is, but it doesn't work somehow.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
We do what we do.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Therefore, analyzing, you need to understand,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
if such a document already exists,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
then it is about what was thought about.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And so, when you analyze what you will read,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
what you will see,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
you will understand whether there are gaps or not.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Whether there is a discrepancy or not.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
The next is observation.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Observe how it all happens around you.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
The next is an interview or conversations.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Who can you talk to?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You can talk to employees

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
who have been hired in the company

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
up to six months ago.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Those who remember how it was with them.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
This is a conversation with employees

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
who are fired after less than a year.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Remember?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Those who do not want to spoil the work record,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
but can no longer work with us for some reason.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
This is an interview with managers,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
whose divisions have a large set of staff.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
What do they do with people?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
How do they work?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Who works with them?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Managers are a very good source of information.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
These are our direct clients,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
internal clients in the company.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
We work with them.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
The next is a focus group with experts.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Under the experts, we understand

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
the staff of the department,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
the same managers,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
the same leading employees of other departments.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
When we get together and ask a question

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
about how it is, whether it is correct,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
whether it works.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Why doesn't it work if it is so?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
The next is a survey.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
The so-called pulse survey.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
During internal corporate research,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
there is such a practice in your companies,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
a small block is included for employees

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
who have worked less than half a year

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
with certain questions.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
The advantage of this method is

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
that we can cover almost 100% of the target audience.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
The disadvantage is that we will not ask enough questions.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Perhaps they will not tell us

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
what they could tell us during the interview.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Because during the survey,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
we will not write down the questions,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
we will not guess.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
The next point is what to ask.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Here is the manager,

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
here are the employees who have worked for half a year,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
and so on.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
What do we ask?

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
The first question is whether the importance of adaptation

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
is understood by linear managers.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
What do managers think about this question?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
They say,

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
why do we need it?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
He came and came, let him work,

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
and they are glad that we invited him.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Or they understand that something needs to be done,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
even if he is glad that we invited him.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The next question is who is responsible

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
for the adaptation process of a new employee.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Who exactly?

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
The manager, the mentor, the staff service,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
the manager in the only person who does everything,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
as it sometimes happens,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
and is responsible for it too.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
If not,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
how are the roles of the staff service

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and the roles of the departments

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
in the process of adaptation?

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
The next question is how much the introduction to the position

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
and the whole procedure is differentiated

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
by the hierarchy of the profession.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
How different are we in the company

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
to the specialists of different departments?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Do we have this or not?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Next,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
who defines the mentor for the employee?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
And in general,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
is it interesting to be a mentor in the company?

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Do the people who are already working

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
want to become mentors for the new ones?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Or is it a headache that says,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
God, someone again, and again me?

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
The leading employee with the internship says,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
because he really knows everything,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and we have no one but him.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
And for him,

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
it's a breath of relief every time.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
And he,

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
being a very loyal to our company,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
goes to the internship every time.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
This is a bad indicator.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
What is included in the complex of adaptation?

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
What tools are developed?

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
How often are they updated?

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
How do we evaluate the whole procedure?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Have we achieved the goal we wanted?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Or not?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
How is the effectiveness of the event evaluated?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
These are the questions.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Again, it's a series of questions.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I've given you several of them.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
There can be one and a half times more,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
or two times more.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
They can be completely different.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
But the information must be collected

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
to understand how we live.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
I've given you only a few questions as an example.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
They can be completely different.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
Your task as a personnel specialist

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
is to find the most complete answers

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
to the questions about the adaptation procedure

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
in our company.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
So,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
we've analyzed the current situation

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
in our company.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Our next task is

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
to determine the list of tools we need.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
There are several approaches to choosing tools.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
The first one is the so-called problem-oriented approach.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
When the thunder rumbles,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
when we realize that something has happened,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
we need to fix it.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
This is the so-called reactive approach.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
It's not always good.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
It's better to predict, anticipate and understand.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Some people say it's better to do it later than never.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
But if we have an opportunity to work for the future

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
and be proactive,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
we need to be proactive.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
The next one is the process-oriented approach.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
It should be like this.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Everyone has it.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Yesterday I was at a conference

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and I was told that it should be like this,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
like this, like this in a company.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I liked it and I like the company.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Let's do the same.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
When borrowing such tools,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
it's great, it's important.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
We borrow a lot from each other's experience.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
But it's important to understand

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
whether the thing that works well

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
in my friend's company

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
will work for us.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Maybe it will.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
The main thing is whether it's necessary for my company.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The next one is the goal-oriented approach.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Let's say, this is our approach.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is the right approach.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
When there are certain goals

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
in the area of staff management,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
which are, let's say,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
the consequence of the goals

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
of the company itself,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
the goals of development.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And within this,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
we determine what we need,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
how we need to do it.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Colleagues, let's talk about

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
adaptation tools.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And the first tool we will talk about

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
is the Welcome Training.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Welcome.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Welcome.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
In some companies it's called

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Welcome to our course.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
In some companies it's called

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
just a water training, and so on.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
But I like the name Welcome Training,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
so today I will use

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
this name.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
It's important to understand,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
first, that despite the fact

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
that it's called a training,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
in fact, it's not a training.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because it doesn't develop

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
any skills,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
it's just a definition

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
of a real training.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
So, in my previous company,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
where I worked,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
we talked about

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
the vaccination of the company.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's the last opportunity

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
to please the employee

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
and show where he came from.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
If the employee leaves

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
such a training or seminar

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
with a sense of pride,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
which he had inside,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
it means that the goal is achieved.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Very often Welcome Training

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
pursues two goals.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
The first one is knowledge

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
about the company, about the product,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
and so on.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
The second one is emotions.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Emotions should be there.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
In this training, in this seminar,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
emotions should be there.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So, let's talk about the form of the training.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
The first one.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
It can be an auditory course,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
it can be an electronic course,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
or it can be a mixed version.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It's clear that, once again,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
we are determined by the opportunities

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and our needs.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Auditory courses are good

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
because employees can

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
talk to the host,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
they can get to know each other,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
those who joined the company

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
in one period.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
But there are not always such opportunities,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
because the branches of the company

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
can be in different areas,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
in different cities,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and sometimes in different countries.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
So, the first one is auditory.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
The second one is electronic.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Some companies have

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
a very interesting solution

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
when these courses are

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
transferred to the electronic form.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Sometimes, even a kind of

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
a multiplication hero

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
tells about the rules,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
about the norms that exist

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
in the company and informs

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
the employee about some basic things.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
There are many providers

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
that offer such services

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
to the companies.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
A mixed version is

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
when we combine the first and the second.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Perhaps, some part

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
can be studied independently

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
with the help of an electronic course.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
But some part, if there is an opportunity,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
it's great if it will be conducted

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
together, let's say,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
as part of an auditory event.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Colleagues, once again,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
there are many options.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
There are many options.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Choose and combine the format

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
that is necessary and suitable for you.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Periodicity.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
How often should you do it?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
It is determined by the number

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
of new employees in your company.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
If your company is small

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
and there are not many employees,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
it's enough to do it once a month.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
In the Moscow Nut Company,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
where I worked, we did it once every three weeks.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We determined that it's the period

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
when several new people

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
will be working in the company.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
It's often not appropriate.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
It's not good to do it less often.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Someone came after the previous training

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and he will wait for the next one

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
for a month or more.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
We determined that it's once every three weeks

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and we considered this format

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
acceptable for us.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
In another company,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
as far as I know,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
such events are held once a week

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
on Fridays.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Every Friday, all the managers

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
of the department know

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
that the adaptation training

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
is being held now.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It's a welcome course

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
and you need to follow the new employee

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
to make him stay there.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Speaking about periodicity,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I recommend you to hold it

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
not as it will be

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
when the coach

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
has free time,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
but to fix some day of the week

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
as an example.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
You've seen it already.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Let it be

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
a specific time

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
so that the company

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
gets used to it

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
and the managers know about it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
They will remember it

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
in their heads.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
It's not like they will move it

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
today or tomorrow.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
The managers should remember it.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
The next point is the duration.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
How long should it last?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Once again,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
it depends on the goal

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
and what you want to convey.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
The welcome training

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I've mentioned in my previous company

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
lasted for 3 hours.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
1.5 hours was an auditory format

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
when the manager's coach

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
was talking about the company,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
the products,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
corporate culture and so on.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
After that, 1.5 hours was

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
a tour of the production.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
For some, 3 hours is a lot.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
For others, 3 hours is 5 days,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
no less.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
There are such options.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Most often,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
during these 5 days,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
professional training

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
of a certain category of specialists is included.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
When a new salesperson

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
comes to you

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
and before you let them

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
into the sales hall

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
to work with clients,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
you teach them

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
the rules of working with customers

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and the rules of working

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
with complaints

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
about the services you have.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
1. The company's history

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
The company's history is the first.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
If there are any myths in your company,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
tell us about them.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Myths are something close to the truth.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Even the founder

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
may not remember

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
whether it really happened or not.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
But it's the element

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
that affects

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
the emotional part

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
of the training.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
The history,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
the founders,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
the first-person,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
the company's structure,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
all of this is in this section.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
2. Information about

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
the products or services

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
offered on the market

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
The question is

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
how deep to tell about it.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'll give you an example

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
to avoid being unfounded.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
We work in a walnut company

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and when we produce products

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
for the snack market,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
we talk about the products.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
It's our main activity

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
that we are proud of.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
We asked ourselves

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
how to tell about it.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
The answer was

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
that we talked about nuts,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
dried fruits, seeds,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
how they are fried,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
how they grow.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It was the information

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
that was interesting to the employees.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It didn't matter if it was

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
a sales manager,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
a manager or a receptionist.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
When a person learns something new,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
he will tell about it.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
How peanuts grow,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
how pistachios grow.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It's interesting,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
it's not the knowledge

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
that is often superficial.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
During such a module

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
people will learn something new

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
that they will tell their relatives

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
or friends.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
When it comes to the professions

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
where this knowledge

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
is necessary,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
for example, sales managers,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
technologists,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
marketologists,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
it depends on the company structure

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and the products we offer.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
An additional course can be organized

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
where there will be

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
some technical characteristics

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
and so on.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
But it's important to outline.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I know the experience of oil companies

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
that teach their specialists

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
in the introductory course

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
how to extract oil.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Because when you work

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
thousands of kilometers

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
from the wells,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
employees should understand

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
what they work for,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
how they work,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
who works.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
So, the product and services

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
should be in a minimal

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
and modest format

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
for specialists

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
who will work with it more seriously.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
The next is the principles

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
of the company structure.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
You may have already told

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
during the interview

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that you have a training center,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
how the corporate events are held,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
when the company's birthday is celebrated,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
whether it's New Year's Eve.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
So, there are some things

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
connected with your practices,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
with your standards.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It would be great

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
if you invite a person

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
who has made this career

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
by telling about

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
your company.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
He will tell you

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
not about how it is,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
but about how it was in his practice.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
It would be very convincing.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
It would be a plus

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
for the listeners.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I think it would be pleasant

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and even a little bit exciting

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
for the person who will share it.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
The next is the company tour.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Very often

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
such a tour is considered

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
because we are familiar with it,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
we have already visited it.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
It depends on whether

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
it is a review

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
or a detailed tour.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
In each company

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
there are photos,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
awards,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
and other things.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
There are companies

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
with museums.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
If these museums are working,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
if they are newly created,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
there are companies with a long history.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
These museums have been here for a long time.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It is also interesting

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
to know about the company's history.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
For example,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I will give an example of a Belarusian company

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
called Milovitsa.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
There is a museum in the hall

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
of the company.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Since the foundation,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Milovitsa has been here for 100 years.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
So, we can draw a conclusion

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
about how many things

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
the company has to tell

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
not only to employees,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
but also to visitors.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
If it is a company employee,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
it is a great example.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
If there is a movie

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
or even a few companies,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
as I gave an example

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
of a field

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
where the companies' units work,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
or

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
a movie about a certain topic,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
it was shot and the movie exists,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
it is time to show it.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Based on my experience,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
we started the Welcome Training

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
in the Moscow Nut Company

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
with a short 8-minute movie

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
shot by the company

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
for the 10th anniversary.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It was interesting,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
not long,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
emotional and exciting.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And, of course,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
it is the answers to questions

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
that the audience has.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
This is about the content.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Next question.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Who conducts the training?

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
The answer is

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
the staff specialist.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It can be a training specialist,

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
adaptation specialist,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
it depends on the structure.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
It is great if you can

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
involve other specialists.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Remember, we said that

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
when you tell about your career,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
you should invite the person

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
who made it.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It is great if the director

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
of a big company

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
or a small company,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
the general director himself,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
knows that it exists

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and is glad to see

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
his team being replenished.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
If the company is very big,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
it can be a director

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
of a certain field.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
A person,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
a status person in the organization

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
who will be welcomed

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
with a sincere welcome.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Next.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Who else can be involved?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It can be a product specialist,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
a market specialist,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
or a technologist.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
It is very important

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
if you have an union organization.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
You should invite

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
its leader

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
or its member

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
so that they can

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
talk about their activities

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
during the seminar.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Next.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Who develops it?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Once again.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
This product should be interesting.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
So, if you have an opportunity,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
involve specialists in the joint departments.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
First of all,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
specify the goals.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
What and for whom

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
you will talk at the seminar.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Next, define the structure and content.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Prepare the content part

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
so that it is interesting,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
with examples,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
so that people are invited

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
if you decide to invite them.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Test the first versions of the seminar.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Evaluate it.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Give the evaluation sheets

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
to the participants.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Ask questions about how they were.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
If there are any questions left.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Talk to them in person.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Once again.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
You should have a product

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
that is very interesting,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
emotionally rich

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and informative.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It will answer

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
the new employees

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
and will charge them emotionally.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I know from my colleagues' experience

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
that there are so-called

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
newbie days as an alternative

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
to the welcome training.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
They are typical for companies

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
where there is a large influx

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
of new employees,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
possibly due to the influx of young people,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
a set of young specialists.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
If there is such a thing,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
it is also a good option.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
There is a so-called newbie day

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
where the official part is united,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
where the story is told

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
about the blocks we have already discussed

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and the informal part,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
where a corporate team-building event

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
for the employees

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
that came to work

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
in the last month

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
is held.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
The next tool is

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
the employee book.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
It is called differently in companies.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I chose the simplest name.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Its goal is to orient the employee

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
in a large amount of information

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
that he needs to know

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
in the coming days.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
The book can be structured

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
like a welcome training.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
The blocks will be repeated.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
It can start with a greeting

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
of the general director,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
his deputy,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the director of staff,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
then we talk about the company.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
What we have mentioned

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
is a story,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
strategic goals and priorities,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
the organization,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
the collegial management levels.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
The next block

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
can be called our employees,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
which includes the company's managers,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
key employees,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
possibly the best employees.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
The next block

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
is our life,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
where you describe annual events,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
corporate traditions.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
The position of the corporate ethical code

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
is often placed there,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
if such a thing exists in the company.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
The next block

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
is something like our rules.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It includes

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
the local regulations

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
that regulate the activity.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
There can be rules of internal labor order,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
the position of commercial secrecy,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
and so on.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Everything you consider necessary

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
to bring to the employee

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
on the first day

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
so that it is with him.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
The next block

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
can be, for example,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
phone notes,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
instructions on how to order a product

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
or schedule a business trip.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
The answers to the questions

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
that will arise

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
and so that the employee

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
does not run around the company

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
in search of them,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
he already has the answer.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Very often, such books

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
are made by employees

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
in an electronic form,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
which is great,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
because it gives quick access

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
to information,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
the employee can choose

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
what he needs

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
and get an answer to his question.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I can say from experience

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
that the books of employees

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
are sometimes divided thematically.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
For example,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
if you have many new managers,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
maybe you have a growing staff reserve

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
and you are appointed

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
as a manager of a department

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
it is great to make a book

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
for a manager.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You will not put

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
some things there,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
but you will definitely put

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
things related to the manager's topic,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
let's say,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
about what the manager

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
needs to know.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
If an employee experiences

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
a rise and appointment for a new position,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
it is often said that this is a secondary adaptation,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that is, it is already an adaptation

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
in a new place.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
And those positions,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
that information

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
that the employee did not work with before,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
and now, having become a manager,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
he needs it,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
you can include it in such books.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There can be,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
let's say,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
a division by profession.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
For example,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
in one of the energy companies

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
there is a completely amazing book

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
called Energetika.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
It can be a book of a young specialist,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
where you prepare some introductory documents

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
for, let's say,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
for trainees.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
For example,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
in the Moscow Orekhova company,

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I have been addressing

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
and will continue to do so,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
we had a book of a sales department employee.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And there was the information

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
that was necessary

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
for the sales department employees.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
It was already there initially,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
he received it.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
About the sales technique,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
about working with objections,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
about the standards of the book,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
and so on.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
He received it,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and the information that we thought

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
should have been brought to him

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
in the first days,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
it happened.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
What is interesting,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
such books were received

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
by people working in different regions,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
and people working thousands of kilometers

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
from the central office

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
were treated equally

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
with employees in Moscow.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
The next tool

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
that can be in your company

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
is the so-called

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
set of a beginner.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
The question is, what is it different from the employee book?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Once again,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
the employee book is something created,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
structured,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
having a single structure

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and high-quality content.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
As for the set of a beginner,

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
this set can include something else besides the book.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Maybe you don't have a book,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
and there is a number of separate documents

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
that you collect

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
for the arrival of a new employee.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
The set of a beginner can include

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
a corporate newspaper number,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
a plan of entering the position,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
some booklets,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
marketing booklets of the company.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
By the way, a very important point

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
that I have not yet mentioned,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and I will definitely mention it,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
is that when developing such tools,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
whether it is a welcome training,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
a training for professionals,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
PR and marketing departments,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
you should remember the following.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
If a tool is created

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
or borrowed

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
from the marketing department,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
the following may happen.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
The clients of the marketing department

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
are external clients outside the organization,

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
and their tools,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
their brochures

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
are aimed at them.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Our clients,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
the clients of the staff service,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
are the employees.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
And very often,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
the tools of the marketing department,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
a beautiful brochure,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
are good as an additional material,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
but not as a single one.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Because, once again,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
we have a different target audience.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Not external clients,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
but employees.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
The next one is the first day of a new employee.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
We talked about the fact

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
that you need to prepare for this day.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
There should be a ready workplace.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It should be a place for a predecessor.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Some piles of papers,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
broken pencils,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
and so on.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
It clearly shows

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
that a person worked

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
very actively.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
This is not what you need.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
If your company has such things

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
as badges that can be prepared in advance,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
it will be great if it is done.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Very often people ask

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
what badges, we have not yet taken a picture.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
And there is no photo

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
that you need to post.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
But, of course,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
you can do such thing as an e-mail in advance.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
And not to give it to a new employee

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
for a refund,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
who calls the IT service

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
and asks to be connected

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
and done something.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Access to the database,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and so on.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I know an interesting experience

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
that on the first day

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
a sign of welcome

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
from colleagues is prepared.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It can be a small chocolate,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
a bag of nuts,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
or something else.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
It is very good

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
to have such a sign of welcome.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
It will influence

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
a good impression

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
of a new employee

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
from all of us.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Once again,

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
we do not forget

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
that the first few days

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
of a week

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
and a month

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
of a company employee

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
are not only

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
when we look at him,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
but also when he looks at us.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
That is why you have achieved success

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
if on the first day

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
a company employee

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
is proud and has an inner positivity.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
The next point

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
is to introduce a new employee.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Colleagues, there are two aspects.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
First,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
we have to introduce

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
an employee to the workers.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
At the same time,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
we have to introduce

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
a new employee to his team

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and his future colleagues.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
It is clear that

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
it is chaotic in companies.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
If you have introduced a new employee,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
it is like you have introduced him.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
If you have not introduced him,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
you can say that

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
a brand manager is sitting here,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
an accountant is sitting there,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
and so on.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
But there were no such people.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
So,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
he should be prepared

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
at the moment.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
First,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
if we are talking about introducing an employee,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
make sure to separate

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
a regular employee from a new manager.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
If it is a regular employee,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
tell him something

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
and introduce him to his closest circle.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
If it is a manager,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
the field of his future interaction

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
will be larger.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And the manager

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
should be given more information

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
because his subordinates

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
and other employees

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
are interested in it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
If it is a top manager,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
it should not be

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
given to the side.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I recommend

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
preparing so-called meeting plans

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
which include

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
specific information

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
about the scheme,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
who, when and how.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
If it is a big company,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
it is possible to organize a video conference.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Or it is possible

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to post an interview

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
with a new manager

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
in the website

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
where he will answer questions

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and tell about his experience,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
biography and personal characteristics.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It is necessary

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
to introduce a manager.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
People are waiting for it.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Very often, when a new manager comes,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
he will introduce a new method.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It is important to remember

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that this feeling of fear

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
should be replaced

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
by a feeling of trust

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
to facilitate

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
the introduction of a manager

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
to our team.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Sometimes people ask

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
how it is possible

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
to introduce a manager

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
to a big company

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
and tell him

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
to adapt to the new manager.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It is clear that all this happens

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
during a dialogue.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You, as a manager,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
can offer tools.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
There is an Internet site,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
an e-mail,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
an opportunity to post an interview

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
or a note about a position

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
in corporate press.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
We have some options in companies.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Do not forget to work on them.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It is very important.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
At the same time,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
it is important

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
not to overload people.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
If someone has a bad memory,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
a new employee

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
will smile to everyone.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It is important to identify

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
the key people

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
to work with.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
They can be

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
key people

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
from other departments.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It is clear that it is necessary

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
to introduce them to your department.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It is good to introduce them

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
to the higher management.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The employee should know them.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
How else?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
They should know the managers

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
of another level.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
The next tools

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
are related to training.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It is training

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
during adaptation.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It is a training

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that you will consider

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
necessary

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and you will consider

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
necessary to send to the employee.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It can be

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
a variety.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It is good

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
to have a mentor

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and to work with him.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
We will talk about

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
who can be a mentor

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
and what is

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
his job.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Colleagues,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
we have listed a number of adaptation tools.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Once again,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
the list is incomplete.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
These are the main things

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
that are necessary

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
to find the right tool

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
for your organization.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I am sure

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
you already have something like that.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But the question arises.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
How can we

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
do this,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
give this, send this,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and include this person in the project?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
We are ready.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
How can we find the right tool?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The answer is simple.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It is an adaptation list

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
or adaptation plan.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It is a document

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
that is prepared for the arrival of the employee.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You think about it

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and include the necessary

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
activities in it.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
The adaptation list

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
consists of three parts.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The first one is the goals for the adaptation period.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
You prescribe them.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It is a kind of agreement between you and the employee.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The next one is the adaptation event.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It is what you will do,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
what the company

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
will provide to the employees.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You specify the name,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
time, duration,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
and the place of the event

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
so that the employee can orient himself.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The third part is the adaptation event.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It is what you demand

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
from the employee during this period.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Maybe in a month

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
the sales department

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
will want to check

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
how well the employee knows the assortment,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
the product, and the work standards.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It is necessary to record

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
that in a month

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
you will be asked about this,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
about that, and about that.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The adaptation list is signed

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
on the first day of work.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It is signed by the manager and the employee.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It is a document

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
that is a kind of

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
a map for the employee.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It is a kind of a map

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
in his steps

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
to join

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
our company.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Colleagues, let's move on.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Let's answer the question

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
who should

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
develop the training, prepare the book,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
fill the adaptation list, and so on.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Let's just analyze it

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
in order.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It is necessary to understand

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that there are several participants

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
of the adaptation process.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
In the ideal case,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
which is not always

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
met in practice,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
there is a manager.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The manager is the employee's boss.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
The second one is a mentor.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
The third one is a curator.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The fourth one is HR service.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Let's see

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
what each of the participants

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
is doing in the process.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Colleagues, it is necessary to understand

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
that in this case

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
they do not always exist.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Sometimes the company can be small

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
or the department can be very small.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Therefore, the manager

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
performs the functions of the mentor.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
In any case,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
if any of the participants

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
of the adaptation process is not present

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
for any reason,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
the functions of the adaptation process

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
should be distributed among the others.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Let's describe an ideal situation

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
of how it could be

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
if all the participants were present.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The first one is the managers.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
What do the managers do?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Colleagues,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I call you again

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
to understand

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
that the main function

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
of the adaptation of a new employee

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
is within the department,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
not HR service.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
HR service is a consultant,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
coordinator, developer.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
the department managers

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
should be not only our assistants,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
but also our assistants.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It happens very often

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
when people ask questions

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
during the seminars

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
that the manager does not hear them.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
At this stage,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
we can say that

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
the decision is either

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
not sold,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
that is, the manager does not see the benefits,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
or he is not comfortable

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
with the way you offer.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Be sure to enter into a dialogue.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Perhaps you have developed

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
such an adaptation list

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
that it takes a lot of time

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
to fill it.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You are very well prepared for this.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Perhaps you can cut it four times.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It will be on one page,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
but it will be clear,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
the manager will work with it.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
What we offer should be a working result.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Then the managers

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
become our supporters.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
To make it work,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
be sure to ask what they need,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
how convenient it will be for them to work.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
If we talk about the manager,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
then the manager determines

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
the duties of the future employee.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It is clear that

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
very often it is already written,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and we knew about it

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
at the selection stage.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But I say it again,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
because there are different moments in life,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
and sometimes it is surprising.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The next thing.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The manager sets goals and tasks

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
for the test period.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
He says what he will be asked

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
from a new employee

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
after a certain period of time.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
The next thing.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
The manager determines a mentor

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
from the number of working specialists.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
He introduces the new employee

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
with an adaptation sheet

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and explains the purpose of the event.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The manager prepares

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
the adaptation sheet.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The next thing is

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
tracking intermediate results.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It is important when

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
in a month or two,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
or in a short period of time,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
there is a conversation

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
between the employee and the manager,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
where the manager

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
directs and answers

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
the questions that may arise.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
The next thing is

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
evaluating the tasks

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and conducting evaluation events

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
at the end of the adaptation period

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
or the test period.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
If we compare these concepts

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
and prepare adaptation programs

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
for three months,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
the test period is equivalent.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
The last thing is

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
making a decision

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
whether a person will stay in the company

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
or continue working.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
The manager sets the direction

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
of the activity.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
These are all his functions.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They are not so simple,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
but they are useful

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
if there is a mentor.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
What does the mentor do?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The mentor's function

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
is to prepare

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
the workplace

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
for the first day of the event.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
The mentor is responsible

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
for the preparation

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
of the workplace

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
for the first day of the event.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
He is responsible for the greeting

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
of the first day of the event.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I know an interesting solution

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
in one of the companies,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
where the application

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
for the new workplace

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
is filled by the manager

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
on the day of the application

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
for the search of the employee.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
The application is already in the form of an application

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
and the information is sent

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
to the necessary services.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
The process is automated.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
The mentor accompanies

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and trains the employee

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
during the period

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
of his joining

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
the organization,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
the team and the position.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
This is his assistant.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Let's talk about the mentor's functions.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
The first and main task

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
is to train the employee.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
This is to pass on the knowledge

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and skills that are necessary.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
The mentor's institute

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
is vital

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
in the production units.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
When working

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
with equipment

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
or certain tools,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
the mentor is needed

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
for the person

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
who came

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
with the work experience.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If he is a young specialist,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
there can be no discussion.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
The next task

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
is organizational assistance.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
This is the most important

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
task

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
in the organization.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It is to provide

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
the Internet access,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
databases,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and so on.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
This is to provide feedback.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Colleagues,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
we should not always be optimistic.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It is important to understand

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
that not everyone can be a mentor.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
We will also mention

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
the competencies that distinguish

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
a mentor from a non-mentor.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It is important to understand

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
that the person

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
can pass on the knowledge

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
to another person.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
When I mentioned the participants,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I also mentioned the mentors

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
as curators.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
In some companies,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
this term is used as a synonym.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I want to suggest the curator

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
as a so-called buddy.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
In Russian,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
it is a friend.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
A friend.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
If a mentor

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
is usually a higher status person,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
a person with a more formalized

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
attitude,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
because he sets a task, evaluates,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and corrects it,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
a curator is a person

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
who accompanies,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
helps,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and is responsible

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
for the social adaptation

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
of a person in the team.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
He tells how and when

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
it is customary to go to lunch,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
how other employees

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
are thrown off on their birthdays,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
how it happens.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
These are small things

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
that you don't always write down

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
in books, even if they exist.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
The simplest example

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
is that you need to bring

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
a cup of tea from home

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
or you can use the one you have.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Very often

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
we don't assign such people.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
We say, you will be his friend.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
There are people

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
who take a new person

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
under the wing

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and tell him about some

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
of the team's features.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
They support him emotionally.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I don't always

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
highlight this as a side.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But you need to remember

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
that there are such aspects.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You need to think about

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
how it will be solved

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
if you don't have such a friend.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
What does the staff do?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
We forgot about it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
First,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
the staff is responsible

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and manages all projects

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
if it can be called a project

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
for the adaptation of a new employee.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
They monitor

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
the system's efficiency

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
and some adaptation tools.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
The staff's activities

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
can be divided into

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
new employees and clients.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
That is, mentors and line managers.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
What do we do for new employees?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
First of all,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
we participate in

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
adaptation activities.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It can be a welcome training

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
or a beginner's day.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The service's specialist

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
takes part in it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It's a preparation

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of the employee's kit.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It's a guide to some companies.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's an emotional support

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
for a new employee.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It always happens that

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
the person who chose

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
the person in the company

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
is always worried

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and asks the employee

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
how things are going

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and if everything is fine.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
The next activity

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
is aimed at the internal clients

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
or line managers or mentors.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
It's a development of the activity

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
on the training of the mentor skills.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It's a development

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
of motivational schemes for mentors.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
If we say that the institute of mentorship

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
exists,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
we should understand

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
how we stimulate people

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
to strive for

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
and be effective mentors.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
So,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
if we talk about the institute of mentorship,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
in some companies

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
it's necessary to understand

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
that a mentor can combine

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
his or her direct activity

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
with mentorship.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
In some other companies

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
these positions are allocated.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
For example, in a retail chain of stores

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
in a specific state

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
and even in every store

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
there can be a coach

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
who is constantly training

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
day and night

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
and is a mentor for new employees.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
They combine their activity

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
with another one,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
for example, with a job at a cashier.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Here is the next question

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
which is often asked.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Do we pay mentors' activity

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
or not?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It's important to understand

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
that any stimulation in a company

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
is divided into financial and non-financial.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
If we talk about financial things,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
the decision we make

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
depends on several factors.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
First of all,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
it's the intensity of selection.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
How many new employees do we have?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
If we don't have enough of them,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
then,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I think,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
it will be an honorable task

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
for one of the employees

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
to perform the function of mentors.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
If the flow is big

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and we want to be sure

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
of the efficiency of the process,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
then we need to develop

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
a stimulus scheme.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
It all depends on corporate culture.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
How we do it.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
How honorable

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
it is to be a mentor.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And how non-financial stimulation

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
proves that it's really so.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
We say that it's a professional development,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
that it's a certain status in a company.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
If it is,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
then we give up

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
the material component.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
If it's not,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
then we give up the material component.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
This is the second factor.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
The third one is the size of the organization.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Usually, the bigger the organization,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
the more the institute of mentorship

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
exists as such.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And in the reward schemes

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
the criteria and mechanisms

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
of evaluation of these criteria

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
are prescribed,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
for which mentors receive a bonus.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Funds are prescribed

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and budgeted by the director

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
of the personnel

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
and the funds for mentorship.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's important not to forget

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
that

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
it's useful

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
if we reward

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
for the result, not for the process.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The result of the mentor's activity

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
is

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
an effective employee

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
who has taken the position.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Therefore, one of the interesting

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
options when we offer bonuses

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
is not for the fact that

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
a person works for two months

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
and receives something every month,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
as if he has

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
a mentor.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
No.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Let him receive it once after two months,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
but for the result.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It's very important.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It's great if the key indicators

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
of efficiency

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
or KPI

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
are developed

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
and the schemes are transparent for the employees.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
If we talk about

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
non-financial stimulation,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
we don't pay much attention to it.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's a waste of time,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
because it's not a budgetary

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and costly tool.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
For example,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
recognition of the status of employees.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
One of the companies

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
holds a competition for the best mentor.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
The budget of the competition

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
is not very large,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
but its emotional component

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
is connected

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
with the company's status.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Its efficiency is very high.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
It's necessary to remember

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
that if a person is included

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
in the staff reserve

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and acts as a mentor

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
to someone else,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
it's one of the elements

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
of his development program

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
that can be indicated in his plan.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
We use reservists,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
teaching them to be a mentor.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
All sides win.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Let's talk about evaluation

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and training of mentors.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
When we assign a person to be a mentor,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
we should understand

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
that a mentor means

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
having a set of competences

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
that allow him

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
to become effective.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It often happens

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
that a good employee,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
very smart,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
but he can't pass his knowledge

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
to someone else.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
In this case,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
we should either teach

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
this employee to do it,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
or understand that someone

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
else will become a mentor.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Not every good football player

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
or athlete becomes a good coach.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Coaches or mentors

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
are additional competences

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
in communication,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
in understanding people,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
in the ability to give feedback,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
in the ability to be flexible,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and so on.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
First of all,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
the desire to pass knowledge

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
is tolerance.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
When we assign a person

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
to be a mentor,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
we should take into account

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
these competences.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Some of these competences

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
can be developed,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and then they should be

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
taught and developed

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
by the mentors.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
When we assign a pool of experts,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
they pass the training

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
we offer.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Speaking about the fact

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
that we should sell solutions

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
to the leaders,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
let's imagine

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
that HR manager

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
of a company

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
develops an adaptation tool

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and attracts a leader

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
who gets irritated

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
and says,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
«What should I do?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
What should I do with a newbie?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I already know what to do».

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
In this case,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
the solution for this

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
HR manager

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
is not to give up

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
and to create

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
positive precedents

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
in this area

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and in other departments.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
He starts working with

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
the leaders of other departments

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
who will understand

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
the benefits of

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
the adaptation tools

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
and will talk about it

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
in the company.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I'll give an example

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
of a case when

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
one of my colleagues

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
was very worried

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
that she couldn't

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
find a common language with the manager.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
As she told me,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
she had a kind of inner victory

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
when she was interviewing

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
a new employee

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
who was not friendly

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
to the manager.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
The candidate

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
asked the question,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
«I'll join the company,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
what will happen next?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
What will I get?»

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
The manager,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
who was always against

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
and refused to participate

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
in any activities,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
said, «You'll get

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
an adaptation list

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
with all the adaptation activities

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
that you'll have to attend».

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
It was her kind of

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
victory

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
that the candidate

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
saw the benefit

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
and started

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
offering it

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
to the future employees.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It's clear that

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
in such a situation

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
the candidate

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
will become a supporter

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and an ally of HR manager.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Colleagues,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
let's move on

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
to the next part

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
and talk about the features

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
of adaptation of different categories of employees.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Remember,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
at the beginning

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
we talked about UDIT.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
We said that the tools

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
differ depending on the position,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
hierarchy and professional

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
characteristics of employees.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Or what is used

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
all together.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Let's talk about it.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
We can divide employees

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
into several categories.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The first one is

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
ordinary employees or workers.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The next one is

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
engineering and technical workers,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
service workers, specialists.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
The next one is young specialists.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
The next one is

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
remote employees,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
line managers

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
and top managers.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
These are the six categories

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
of employees.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
There can be only four of them

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
if there are no remote offices

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and the company doesn't work

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
with young specialists.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It's important to remember

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
that the so-called

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
adaptation matrix

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
is a good tool for you.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It tells you

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
which tool

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
for which category of employees

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
you use and when.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
At what stage of adaptation.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Speaking about the features

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
of adaptation of different categories

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
of employees,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
we should remember

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
that we talked about

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
the aspects of adaptation.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Remember, organizational,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
social, professional,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
and psychophysiological.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
The tools should be

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
connected to the aspects

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
depending on the category of employees.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Let's see what I mean.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
First, if we talk about

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
the employees as a target group.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I have a number of

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
employees,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
let's say,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
working specialists.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
First,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
we should admit

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
that sometimes we don't

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
pay attention to them.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
We start developing all tools

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
for the specialists,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
offices, and so on.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
If the employees

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
come to the warehouse

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
and ask for a tool,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
we should show them

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
how to use it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
We should also understand

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
that this category is

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
numerous for many companies.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Such people

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
of such positions

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
vote by their feet.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
If something goes wrong,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
there are many offers

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
that are accepted by other companies.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
We will be left

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
in search

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
of the wrong places.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
We should always

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
work out what and how.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
It may not be

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
a book of employees

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
or a folder that we give to everyone

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
if we talk about the managers

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
of the department of sales.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It may be a note for a new employee

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
with the necessary things.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It may be a schedule of the day,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
a phone number of the shift manager

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
in case of a call.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Some rules,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
and so on.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
When a person gets a salary,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
what to do

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
if he gets sick.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Some instruction to the actions

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
that we provide to a person.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
It may be in a limited order,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
but it should be.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Since we started talking

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
about the next category,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
it is specialists,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
engineers, and technicians.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
As I said,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
tools are developed

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
and they are the most

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
important in this category.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It is very important

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
for the employees

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
who came to this position

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
to tell about the company,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
it is an organizational aspect.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
To tell about the team,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
to lead the team,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
it is a social aspect.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
For the young specialists,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
the next category

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
will be a professional

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
aspect of adaptation.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Young specialists

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
were excellent yesterday,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
they know a lot.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Unfortunately,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
the gap between the education

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
that students get in universities

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and the skills

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
that are required in business

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
exists.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
For young specialists,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
the most important will be

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
the professional aspect.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
When we teach a person

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
to the level we need.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It is an organizational aspect.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Why?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Because such people

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
may not have the experience of work.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
What is the business process?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
What is the business environment?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
What are the business rules?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
It is important

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
that we need to

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
adjust the system

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
for young specialists.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
We need to choose the tools

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
that are necessary for them.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
If we talk about the remote office,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
what is the priority?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
It is not necessarily

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
a thousand kilometers.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
It can be a warehouse

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
on the next street

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
where 2-10 employees work.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
They are separated

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
from the central office.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It can be a small branch

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
of a bank retail network.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It can be a retail network

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
or a store.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
It can be a perfumery

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
where 3-5 salespeople work

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and the central office

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
is a place

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
where they were once

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
when they wrote an application.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
What is the important aspect?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It is the company's vision.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
They should feel like a part of the company.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
It is very important.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
What are the norms?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
How do we live?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
We should not have

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
a special subculture.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
We are here,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
and they are somewhere else.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
If we talk about

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
small branches,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
there can be no staff specialist.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
For example,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
there is a central office

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and its functions are taken by

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
a line manager.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
It is important

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
to build all the tools

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
from this point of view.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It is important for people

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
to feel like a part of the company.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
The next group is

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
line managers,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
top managers.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Let's look at them.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
They are people who have

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
the experience

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and knowledge

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
that we need.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
The professional aspect

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
is not important.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
What is important?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
The organizational aspect.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
A person worked in a business environment.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
He got used to the business processes

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
that were organized.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It happens very often

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
that a person gets disappointed

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
because he cannot find

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
the tools he used to work.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
He was efficient

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
and worked with a great automated management system.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
He was well-tuned

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
and was assigned to his tasks.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
He cannot show the same efficiency

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
because the company did not

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
establish a management account.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Therefore, a person should be introduced

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and told how and what we do.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The next thing is

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
working with a team.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Taking a person from the country

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
to the position of a manager,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
we understand that there can be

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
specialists in his department

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
who would like to take this position.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
It is important to understand

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
whether there will be friendship

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
or this person

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
whose hopes were not fulfilled

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and who would like to take this position

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
but you did not assign him for some reason

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
should be introduced and introduced

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
to the new manager.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
A person who will explain

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and tell the situation

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
will become an ally

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and will work together.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You, being a competent person,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
will prevent

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
the possible conflicts

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
that could happen.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Continuing the conversation

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
about middle-level managers,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
it is important to remember

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
that they need the support

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
of top managers

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
especially in the first days of their lives.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Because the support of top managers

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
allows a person

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
to join the team

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
less painfully

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
and to be accepted.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Because if a top manager

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
uses respect,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
the decision of a top manager

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
will be accepted and fulfilled by the employees.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
If we talk about top managers,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I remind you about

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
the plans of acquaintance.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
About the events that you prepare

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
and plan

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
to introduce

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
a top manager

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
to the company.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
To the whole company.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
If we talk about

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
people who occupy

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
the highest positions.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Here we talk about

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
the organizational aspect

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and the social aspect.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That is, joining the team.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
The next thing

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
that is important not to forget

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
and we have already mentioned it a little bit today

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
is that we talk a lot

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
about the adaptation

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
of a new employee.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
But in no case should we forget

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
about the adaptation of a new employee.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Despite the fact that

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
the employee already works,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
knows everyone, and so on.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
The main aspects

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
will be

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
the professional aspect.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That is,

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
a person occupying a new position

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
is either ready,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and we trained him while he was in the personnel reserve,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and he was the successor

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
to the position he was assigned.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Nevertheless,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
it is very important to remember this.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Because, let's say,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
the rotation can be both vertical,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and this is related to career growth,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
and horizontal.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
This is related to professional growth

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
in companies that cannot

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
offer rapid career growth,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
but nevertheless are interested

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
in the development of employees.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
In this case,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
it is necessary to remember that,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
on the one hand,

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
the rotation can be within one unit,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
or within different units,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
within different divisions,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
and within enterprises that are located,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
as we said, in different areas,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
or in different cities, or even in different countries.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Despite the fact that,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
for example, relocation

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
or moving of an employee

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
from one country to another,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
and he is a very strong specialist,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
he knows the business company well,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
he is a beginner for this company,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
he may not know people,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
or know only some of them,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
he does not know

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
how business processes are organized.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Therefore,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
it is also important to deal with this issue.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Sometimes,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
the experience of working

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
in one of the large companies

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
in the consulting project

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
for the adaptation of the staff

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
that I participated in

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
was that

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
one HR gives a person

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and stops his activity

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
when moving to another city,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
and the other HR

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
does not always accept him on time,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
because it would seem that he is going,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and he should already know a lot,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
he was prepared, and so on.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
The problem was

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
that there was a break,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
when a person was in a vacuum,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
he came to a new place,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
high results were already waiting for him,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
because he showed them there,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
and they put their hopes on him.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
But, let's say,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
the environment,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
not that he was not ready

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
for his arrival,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
but, let's say,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
some help from the organization,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
which should be there,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
it was not there at first,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
which certainly affected

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
the effectiveness of this person.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Continuing the conversation

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
about the adaptation of a person

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
to a new position,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
we talked about the adaptation sheet,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
in this case,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
there should be an analogue.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Very often it is called

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
an individual development plan,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
because the adaptation sheets

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
for, let's say,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
employees of the same profession

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
can be copied.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
A sales manager came to us,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
we have an adaptation sheet,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
tomorrow a person comes to us

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
for a similar position,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
this adaptation sheet will also work for him.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
When we talk about individual development plans

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
for adaptation to a new position,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
there should be an individual approach,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
and we initially understand,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
evaluate what is necessary

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
for a particular employee

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
when moving to this position,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
what information,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
what training,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
what auxiliary materials.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So, colleagues,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
a few words about the adaptation matrix,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
which we also talked about today.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
In a good way,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
the adaptation matrix

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
is not always a document

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
or something else,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
but it is a kind of understanding,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
a system we are talking about today,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
which includes the following points.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
When we say that we have

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
different categories of employees,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
those categories that are in our companies,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
how we divided them

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
according to the necessary numbers.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Next, we say that there is a list of tools,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
one tool works

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
for all categories,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
one tool works

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
only for one or two.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
There is a period of adaptation,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
at what period

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
we apply them.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
On the first day,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
the first week,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
the first three months,

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
the introductory period,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
the introductory period,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
the introduction to the position,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and so on.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And it is necessary,

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
responsible,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
to have a list of tools

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
for the adaptation process.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
As we remember,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
the participants are the staff,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
managers and mentors.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
When we combine this matrix,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
and sometimes people start

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
to draw from it,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
to see where are the holes,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
where the work is not going,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
to change the situation.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
In a good way,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
it is a tool,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
in case when it works,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
it is a tool for adaptation.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
It is not a set of tools

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
that we use.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Colleagues,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
let's move to the next block,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
to the question of efficiency assessment.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
In general,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
the assessment of the efficiency

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
of the tool in the area of staff management

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
is very sensitive.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It is impossible to do it,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
and therefore we will not do it.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It is impossible because it is difficult.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Therefore, why waste time?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
On the other hand,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
it is necessary to do it,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
because our task is

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
to increase the value of the business

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
by competent management

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
of the main resources of the business

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
by people.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Therefore,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
we will talk about

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
and adhere to the point of view

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
that it is possible to assess

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
and necessary,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
even if it is difficult.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
First of all,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
let's see who is interested

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
in assessing the efficiency

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
of the tools

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
that we use in our activities.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
First, it is the shareholders

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
who want to understand

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and want to see the return

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
from the investments

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
that they direct to the business.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Next, it is the top managers

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
and the staff themselves

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
who need to

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
economically justify

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
their activities.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
When we talk about it,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
let's say,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
in general,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
and today we have a narrower topic,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
it is the assessment of the effectiveness

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
of adaptation tools and adaptation systems.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
When does it make sense to say

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
that the first thing

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
when developing and introducing,

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
that is, at the stage when we understand

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
that we have reached the goal

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
or not reached it,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
we jump the gap

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
or jump it only by half.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
The next stage is when we assess

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
the existing system,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
when it works

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
and we understand

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
how it is,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
how and what needs to be done better.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
If we talk about the methods

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
that are used in our companies,

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
the most common are

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
the following methods.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
We talked about them

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
when we talked about the auditing methods

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
of the existing system.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
We called them interviewing,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
questionnaireing,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
conducting surveys,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and so on.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
In this case,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
at the assessment stage,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
we have several other tasks

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
than those that were at the audit stage.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
We audited once,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
but we need to assess constantly,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
so it is very important

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
to ask them what was difficult

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
and incomprehensible on the first day,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
what information was missing,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
when tasks were assigned to you,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
did you receive feedback from the manager,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
did you understand whether your tasks

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
were achieved or not,

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
how often you worked with the mentor,

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
and so on.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Our system should be

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
tuned to people

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
and should be convenient and understandable.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
If our system fails somewhere,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
we will understand

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
what information was missing

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
when we answer the questions.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
If the employees answer

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
that they missed some information,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
for example, about the goals of the company,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
information about their responsibilities,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and so on,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
we receive specific recommendations

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
for actions.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Speaking about the assessment of efficiency,

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I remind you that you can assess

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
the whole adaptation system,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
you can assess a project,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
for example,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
the adaptation

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and adaptation training,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
the training of young specialists,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
for example,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
this project lasted two months,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and we need to understand

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
what we did,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
what we wanted to be done.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
The next third is the assessment

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
of a specific tool.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Depending on this,

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
assessment tools are different.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
It can be a qualitative assessment,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
or an assessment of the results of the research.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
We talk about what we just mentioned,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
what information was provided,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
how convenient it was to use it,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
and so on.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
The next is quantitative methods.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
These are certain indicators of efficiency

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
that we measure

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
and based on which we analyze our work.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
The next tool is

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
an investment analysis tool,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
the so-called ROI,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
or return on investment,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Let's talk a little bit

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
about the last two tools.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
As for the key indicators of efficiency,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
these indicators

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
must be determined,

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
and they must be measured

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
by the staff,

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
even if they are not

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
targeted for a specialist.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
These are the indicators

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
that are like a temperature,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
which must be normal,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
and which must be monitored

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
in their fluctuations and changes.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
What can these indicators be?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The first is the cost of adapting

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
one employee.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I want to draw your attention

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
that the cost is not the same as the budget.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The budget is usually

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
what we have in our pockets,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
what we can use and spend.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Sometimes there is a budget,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and we made a brochure

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
for a new employee.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But the budget is over,

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and adaptation costs money.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The concept of cost is always

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
greater than the cost of the budget.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Even if there is nothing in our pockets,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
and we do not have a budget

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
for adaptation activities,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
adaptation of employees costs something.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
This indicator is calculated

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
based on the time

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
spent on this employee,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
whether it is the time of the manager,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
mentor,

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
or staff employee.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
This indicator is useful

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
to calculate based on categories.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
How much does it cost

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
to adapt one employee,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
one specialist of administration

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
or central office,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
one linear manager,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
and so on.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
The next indicator is

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
the cost of preparing a mentor.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
If we prepare them,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
and not just say that

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
you will be a mentor tomorrow,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
if we make an effort,

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
we should understand

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
that it is not a cost.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
The next relative indicators

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
are the percentage of positions

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
that are covered

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
by the adaptation and mentoring system.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
We have mentors,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and we report to ourselves

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
how many positions

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
are covered

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
by our mentoring system.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It turns out that

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
we are talking about three professions.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Even if they are the most important,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
but these professions are three.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
For some companies,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
it can be a full coverage.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
In other cases,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
it is not necessary.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
For some, it is not enough.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Therefore, there should be tasks

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
to cover more and more professions

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
that are priority for us.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
The next indicator

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
is the test period.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
If we equate the test period

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
to the adaptation period,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
let's see

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
how many people

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
have successfully passed the test period,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
how many have not passed

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
and were fired or were fired.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Again, the indicators are different.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
One thing is the initiative of the employer,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
and another thing is that the employee

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
worked and realized

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
that he made a wrong decision

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
about his future career.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
This is the percentage of employees

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
who were fired during the first year of work.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
I do not forget to remind you

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
that this is also an indicator

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
of the number of employees

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
who are fired.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Of course, 100% of employees

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
are fired not because

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
they made a wrong decision

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
or because they did not like something

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
in the first days.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
There may be other reasons

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
for their dismissal.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
The next indicator

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
is the percentage of employees

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
who are employed as mentors.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
How many mentors do we have?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Do we have one mentor

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
and how many mentors do we have?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
We have a chance to choose the best

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
and to provide different people

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
to develop their competencies in this field.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
The list of indicators

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
is not complete,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
it is not completely closed.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Depending on your tasks,

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
you can choose

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
a number of indicators

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
that you need

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
and that will signal

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
how the adaptation system

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
in your company works.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
It turns out that the professional aspect

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
of adaptation is the most long-term

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
and, most often,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
it is the most resource-intensive.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
When we train an employee

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
with new knowledge and skills,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
we need to think about

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
how to assess

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
the effectiveness of this training.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
The best tool, colleagues,

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
that we have today

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
is the methodology of Donald Kirkpatrick,

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
one of the Western consultants

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
in the field of personnel management.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Sometimes this model is called

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
four-dimensional, four-factor.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
That is not the point.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
It is important to remember its content

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
and use this model

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
when assessing the training.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Let's recall what it is.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Whatever we do,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
whether it is a welcome training

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
or training of some basics of work,

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
it is always important to understand the first thing.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
It is important to assess

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
the reaction of the trained.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Usually, we do it with a questionnaire

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
when we ask questions

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
and ask what we liked, what we did not like,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
what was easy, what was not enough.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
We often stop at this point.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
We say,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
the training was great,

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
but look at the highest marks

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
on the questionnaire.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
But wait.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
We need to understand

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
that at the first level

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
there is only an assessment of the attitude,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
the impression of the participant,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
the training participant

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
or the training program itself.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
We can listen

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
to a lecture

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
of a great coach.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
He will tell you how he worked.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
It will be very interesting.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
But it does not mean

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
that we will have some knowledge

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
about how to play football.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And we will not become football players.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
It is important to remember

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
that even if the first assessment

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
is positive,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
it is only the beginning.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
The next step is the assessment of knowledge,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
the understanding

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
of what is left in the heads of the trained.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
It is very important

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
when it comes to professional training.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
The next level is the assessment

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
of behavior at work.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
How does a person apply

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
the knowledge he has gained at work?

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Has the knowledge been transformed into skills

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
or has it remained?

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
We can continue our analogy about football.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
It is very important to know how to play football,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
but never to enter the football field.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
The next level is the assessment

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
of the result.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
We are talking about the Kirkpatrick model.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
It is the assessment of the result.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Does a person achieve

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
the result

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
for which the training was done?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Let's see how this model works

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
using the example of training.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Let it be a women's clothing store.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
If we take

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
the sellers, consultants,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
we assume

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
that they must pass

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
some introductory training

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
according to the standards and rules

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
of our company.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
We say the following.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
First, we evaluate

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
what the girls

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
at the seminar

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
were like.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Was everything clear?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Did they find a common language with the coach?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
The next level is the assessment of knowledge.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
We ask how much they remember the assortment.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Knowledge of the product

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
is vital for this profession.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
The next level is

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
how much they apply

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
the knowledge they have learned in their work.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
If we teach them

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
how to greet the customer

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
when he enters the store,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
do they greet him?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
How do they work with objections?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
How do they identify the need

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
and offer the product

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
and the assortment in the store?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
This is the third level.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
The fourth level is the result.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
We can measure it

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
and see it in different ways

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
depending on the company's standards.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
It can be the revenue,

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
or the percentage

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
of visitors who left the store.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
It is clear

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
that we have some standards.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
We can't say that if there is a revenue,

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
it is only the result of the training.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Probably, if the service was bad,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
there would be some revenue.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
In any case, we need to measure

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
the level of the store

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
in our case,

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
which works with

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
uneducated sellers.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
The situation changes

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
and it will change radically

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
if you conduct

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
introductory training for these specialists.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Colleagues,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
a few words about ROI,

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
the tool of assessment of return on investment.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
The ROI formula is simple.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
The numerator is the difference

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
between the income and the project cost.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
The denominator is the project cost.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
The result is multiplied by 100%.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
That's all.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
But in fact,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
it is not so simple

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
when it comes to staff management.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
If we use the script

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
to calculate the project cost,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
we have already discussed

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
that the cost is much higher

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
and it is calculated in addition

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and not just the money spent.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
The income from the project

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
is extremely difficult to calculate.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Now there are many discussions

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
about the application of this formula

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
when calculating the efficiency

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
of the staff system as a whole

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
or individual tools.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
It is important to remember

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
that it is really difficult,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
but my task now is to draw your attention

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
to the fact that a number of projects

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
related to the adaptation of staff

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
can be calculated

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
in addition to the cost.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
The most difficult thing

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
in this process

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
will be the calculation

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
of the income from the project.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It is important to remember

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
that not only we could influence

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
the changes that our efforts have brought.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
There could be some external factors

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
that, of course,

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
happened.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And when we say that

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
this result is a consequence

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
of our activity

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
and the consequences of the adaptation tools

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
we can hear the objections

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
of our colleagues.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
My task now is to tell you

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
about the availability of this tool

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
and the possibility of such a tool.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And secondly, to recommend

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
and try to calculate

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
the income from a particular project

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
in your practice,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
even a small one,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
even a very small one

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
in the field of staff adaptation.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
And calculate the result

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and the result it has brought

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
and how this result is expressed

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
in money.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And try to calculate the return

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
on the investments that were invested in it.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Colleagues, I think you will agree

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
that no matter how long

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
and expensive the search for a new employee is,

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
the next necessary step

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
is the adaptation of the staff.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Our company is interested in

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
the fact that the new employee

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
does not resign in a few months,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
because significant funds have already been spent

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
on his recruitment.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Our course will be useful

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
to those specialists in staff management,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
whose task is to improve

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
the effectiveness of the existing adaptation system

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
or its individual tools.
