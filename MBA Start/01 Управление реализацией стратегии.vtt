00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello, my name is Vladislav Tolkach. We will talk about the implementation of the strategy.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Managers can be of two types. The first type is entrepreneurial.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
They understand very well what the situation on the market will look like in 2-3 years

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
and can offer their companies a clear concept of further development that will lead the company to success.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
But it is usually very difficult for them to lay out this concept on a package of actions that are understandable for individual employees,

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
to provide deadlines, indicators and to carry out control over the implementation of these events.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
The problem of many companies is that they do not have a clear concept of how to implement the strategy.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
They do not have a clear understanding of how to implement the strategy.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
They do not have a clear understanding of how to implement the strategy.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
The problem of many companies is that they do not have a clear concept of how to implement the strategy.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
They do not have a clear understanding of how to implement the strategy.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
They do not have a clear understanding of how to implement the strategy.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
They do not have a clear understanding of how to implement the strategy.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
We will discuss these issues during this course.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
I will say a few words about myself. The main place of my work is the Academy of Controlling.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I have been engaged in the topic of controlling and strategy for several years.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
I have been engaged in the topic of controlling and strategy for several years.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
The main structure of the course is as follows.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
First, we will talk about the stage of implementation of the strategy, which is already developed in the general cycle of strategic management of business.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
We will talk about the typical difficulties that companies face at this stage.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
The strategy is already developed, it is proven, it seems correct, but it needs to be implemented.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Shakespeare said very well in the Venice Coup,

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
that if it were as easy to do something as to know what to do, then all the huts would be palaces and all the chapels would be temples.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
Many people think that it is more difficult to implement a strategy than to develop it.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
The second part of our course is the logic of managing goals and key indicators in a company.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
There is such a concept as Management by Objectives.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
The most popular tool in this concept is the so-called balanced system of indicators,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
proposed by Robert Kaplan.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
He uses the term Balanced Scorecard, which is usually translated into Russian as a balanced system of indicators.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
This is the main tool for the implementation of strategies,

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
tested in various companies, various industries, various strategies, and proved to be the best.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
This system is usually created for the company as a whole,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
and we will analyze the technology of creating this system for the company as a whole in detail.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
After that, the so-called cascading is usually carried out.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
Cascading is the creation of such systems of goals and indicators for structural units of an organization.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
This is the so-called decomposition, and this is the next part of our program, which we will also discuss in great detail.

04:13.000 --> 04:24.000
And we will conclude with the point in which we will discuss how the system of goals and indicators of structural units

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
is connected with the management accounting system and with the system of personal stimulation.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
So, the first section is the stage of the implementation of the strategy, in general, the cycle of strategic management of business.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
In general, the cycle of strategic management of business can be represented as the following scheme.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
There are five stages in the chain of interrelations.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
The first stage is the so-called strategic analysis, when the company tries to understand

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
what the configuration of forces in the external environment will look like in the near future,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
and tries to assess its own strengths and weaknesses at the moment,

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
in order to apply all this to the next stage, stage number two,

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
where the company formulates and evaluates alternatives for its own further development.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
There can be several, two, three, four.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
After evaluating and weighing the strategic alternatives, the company usually decides on one

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
strategic alternative, which is then prescribed as a system of strategic goals and events.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
After that, you can say that the company has a strategy.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And then a rather complex stage of its implementation begins.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
This is the stage we are talking about in this course.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
At the stage of the implementation of the strategy, we can talk about the presence of rather typical difficulties,

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
which many companies have in different industries with different strategies.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
The first difficulty is that not all employees of a company of a high level in the hierarchy,

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
being up at 3 a.m., can clearly formulate the strategy of the company they work for.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Not all of them.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
Employees of the second and third levels of the hierarchy should understand where we are going

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
and what will happen to the company in two, three, four years.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
The second difficulty is that employees of the party's general line can formulate it.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Maybe not at 3 a.m., being up, but they can formulate the party's general line.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
But they find it difficult to say what they should do at their workplace for this.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
And a very important point is what they should not do in order for the company to successfully implement its strategy.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
The second difficulty is how my interaction with the adjacent structural units should be.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Employees should understand not only my role, but also the role of my colleagues from the structural units,

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
how I interact with them in order for the party's general line to exist.

07:23.000 --> 07:32.000
The third difficulty is that employees can understand the party's general line and their own role,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
but they may disagree with the party's general line.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
There are a lot of reasons for this.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
One of the reasons is that they were not invited to the meeting where the strategy was being developed.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
Or the employees may have different views on how the company should develop.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
And since they disagree with the company's strategy,

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
it is unlikely that they will invest 100% in order for this strategy to be implemented.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
The fourth difficulty is the lack of control.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
The strategy is translated into a package of actions that is clear for the employees.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
There are deadlines and indicators, but there is no control function.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
The company's management did not have time to set the control points and implement this control

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
for the implementation of the measures that are necessary to achieve the strategic goals.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Another difficulty is that the strategy of the company does not inspire people

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
or is not related to their system of stimulation.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
The employees cannot say how the actions of the mentioned management are related to the system of compensation.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
They may simply not do it because there will be no rewards or punishments.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Therefore, it is very important to introduce a strategy with a motivation system

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and a stimulus system for the employees.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The conclusion is simple.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
The organization and its structural divisions need a simple and clear system of goals and indicators

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
related to the system of accountability and the system of stimulation of the employees.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
And we will talk about how to create this system of goals and indicators for the company.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
The goal management logic is quite simple.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
As a rule, the goals of the business as a whole are created at the first stage.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
We consider the company as a single whole and we can say that the company has certain goals.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
After that, the declaration of the goals is carried out.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
The company is not limited to the goals of the business.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
We can say that the company has certain goals.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
After that, the decomposition is carried out and we talk about the goals of the company's structural divisions.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
About business units or functional divisions.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
At the stage number three, we develop the activities, actions, projects,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
the implementation of which is necessary to achieve the goals of the structural divisions.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
After developing this package of activities, we can start to implement them.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Here is a very important point.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
The function of management control is needed.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
And, as a rule, not everything goes as we planned, not everything goes as we planned.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Therefore, very often companies have to make adjustments to the package of actions

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
that they have come up with to achieve their own goals.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
In addition to control, at the stage of implementation of the event,

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
some adjustments are usually made.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Then, when we have completed the package of events, we can assess the results.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
If they are good, then we can talk about the reward for the achieved result.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
So, the cycle of goal management is quite simple.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
The goals of the business as a whole, the goals of the structural divisions,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
the events and projects necessary for their achievement,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
their implementation, control, adjustments,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
assessment of the achieved results at the end,

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
and compensation, reward, bonuses.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
The most popular tool for the concept of goal management

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
and key indicators is the system proposed by Robert Kaplan.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
He called it a balanced scorecard.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
The most popular version of this term in Russian is a balanced scorecard.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Let's look at the logic of this system.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It is quite simple.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
We start to write the goals of the company as a whole

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
and we write them in four interconnected projections.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
At the first stage, the company sets its own financial goals.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
We can say that most companies exist to make a profit.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
And we talk about the targeted profits that we want to make

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
in the framework of the project number one, the project finance.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
After we have determined our own financial goals at the first stage,

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
we think about what positions on the market we want to achieve

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
in order to make the targeted profit that we want to make.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
At the second stage, we think about who our client is,

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
who could provide us with these profits,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and what our product portfolio should look like

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
in order to make the targeted group that we have chosen

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
count the money that we want to make.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
So, the goals at the second stage are the goals in the client-product projection.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
The question that we have to answer here is very simple and complex.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
The question is, who and what do we sell to?

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
What are the leading positions in the targeted segments that we want to achieve?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
And how should our product portfolio look like

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
in order to achieve the goals in the top projection, the finance projection?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Having determined the goals at the second projection,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
we move on to the third, which is usually called the business process.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
Here we list the goals that we should achieve in the chain of our own processes,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
starting with the design of the product,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
continuing with the purchase of resources, production, branding,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
sales, distribution and services.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
In the third projection, we think about the business processes

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
that our business consists of.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
The fourth stage is the goals in the personnel projection.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
We think about the goals that we should achieve

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
in terms of the competence of our personnel,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
in terms of their satisfaction and motivation

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
in order to achieve the goals in the client-process projection and finance.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
So, the logic of the goal setting is quite simple.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
The first stage is finance, the second stage is the client and product portfolio,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
the third stage is the business processes,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
and the fourth stage is the personnel.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
The main gurus who think and write on this topic are

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Robert Kaplan and his colleague David Norton.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
Four books of these authors are translated into Russian.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I will list them briefly.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The Balanced System of Indicators. From Strategy to Action.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
The Organization Based on Strategy.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
The Third Book is Strategic Maps.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And the Fourth Book is Strategic Unity.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
The German-speaking guru is Peter Horvath.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
His book is also in Russian.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
It is called The Introduction to the Balanced System of Indicators.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
I want to note that this book has a lot of practical examples from different industries.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
And, in addition, there are researches, surveys of companies from different industries,

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
how they understand this system, what results they have achieved,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
what they have achieved, what they have not.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
The information about this is well presented in this book.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
In addition, I should mention Paul Niven's book

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
The Balanced System of Indicators.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
And Hubert Rampersad's book The Universal System of Indicators.

16:08.000 --> 16:17.000
So, the strategy of a company at the business level is described in four interconnected projections.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
The first stage is the financial projection,

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
in which we determine our own financial goals and results.

16:28.000 --> 16:36.000
In the second stage, we write down the goals in the client and product projection.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
But it should be noted that the common standard logic of the goal for companies from different industries

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
and different strategies is unlikely to be invented.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
All companies can have their own specific nuances.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
In particular, the second projection can look different for different companies.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
As a rule, companies from all industries with any strategies need to build relations with their clients.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
And the client projection is available for the vast majority of companies.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
But some companies, within the framework of the second projection,

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
can set goals in relation to the state.

17:26.000 --> 17:35.000
For example, if a business company intends to build relations with officials, state bodies,

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
and requires a lot of attention from top management,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
then within the framework of the second projection,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
goals can be set in relation to the state.

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
There are companies whose business is based on very good relations with suppliers.

17:54.000 --> 18:02.000
And relations with suppliers can also be prescribed within the framework of the second projection.

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
Or relations with partners, which are very important for the business,

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
can also be prescribed in the second projection.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Therefore, for some companies, this projection is not called a client and product,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
but a client and product of the state.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Or a client and product of a supplier.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
In fact, the second projection is intended to list all those

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
with whom we in our business, in our industry, should build relations to earn some money.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
The third projection is business processes.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
The entire chain of processes of the company is considered here, in a large cage, as a rule.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
But the entire chain of processes.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
And at the fourth stage, we already talked about what people we need

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
to achieve the goals in the above projections,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
and what kind of infrastructure we need.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Infrastructure is usually called software products, equipment, buildings,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
maybe transport, which people need,

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
personnel need to perform processes normally.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
And the connection between these four projections is quite logical.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
The connections go from bottom to top.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
And we see on this diagram that if the organization managed to lure the right personnel into the company,

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
managed to buy the infrastructure it needs,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
then this right personnel, inspired, directed in the right direction,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
will ensure the achievement of the goals in the business processes section.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
If our processes are built, look as we want them to look,

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
then most likely, customers will be satisfied with us.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
We will have very good positions on the market,

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
and satisfied and loyal customers usually get a lecture with money,

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
and in the end we get the amount of money we want to get.

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
So this is the map of goals, which Kaplan calls the strategic map.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
He uses the term strategy map.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It is written from bottom to top.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Stage 1 is finance, stage 2 is customer and product,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
stage 3 is business processes, and stage 4 is personnel.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
But the connections between the projections go in the opposite direction.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
From personnel to business processes, from business processes to customers,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
and from customers to finance.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
Let's talk about all four projections of the strategy description in more detail.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
The first projection is the finance projection,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
which should give a clear answer to the question,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
what financial results our company wants to achieve.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
We build a business oriented towards earning a million,

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
or we build a business oriented towards earning one billion,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
or we build a business oriented towards earning one thousand.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
There are quite different businesses,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
and it is very important to understand at the first stage,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
what business we are going to build.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
The list of goals in the finance projection is quite standard.

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
As a rule, the company in this projection writes the goals related to its own turnover,

21:30.000 --> 21:42.000
sales, profit, and cash flow.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
This is a very important parameter.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
As the American financialist Alfred Rappaport said,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
profit is opinion, cash is fact.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
Profit is profit, but we should also monitor the amount of cash flow.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Therefore, the goals related to the value of the cash flow

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
usually exist in the company in this projection.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
Next, a very important value that most businessmen should observe

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
is the profitability of the invested capital.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That is, the profit we have earned,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
we compare it with the amount of capital invested in the business,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
and looking at the value of this parameter,

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
we understand how effective the dollars, euros or rubles invested in our business are.

22:31.000 --> 22:42.000
And finally, another category in the finance projection is the business value.

22:42.000 --> 22:53.000
This category is of interest only to those businessmen who want to sell,

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
who grow their business for sale.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
The business value is the same as the well-being of shareholders

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
or the size of the company's own capital.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
As a rule, shareholders want to become richer,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
and therefore, the goals related to the business value

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
can be of absolutely all companies, public and not,

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
focused on sales and not focused on sales.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
On this slide, in the form of these yellow ovals,

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
the system of financial goals of one company is presented,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
which works in the kitchen furniture market,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
and by doing the goal projection,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
they formulated the goals in the finance section,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
related to the following categories.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
This is the target turnover, the target profit,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
the target value of the cash flow,

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
the target value of the profitability invested in the capital,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
and the target value of the business value.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
You can see that there are certain causal links between these categories.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
We can say that the more turnover there is in a company,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
the more profit there will be in the company.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
The earned profit increases the value of the company's own capital,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
so we draw a line from the profit to the business value.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
The same is true if the profitability invested in the company's capital

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
is greater than the value of the capital

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
that the company used in this period,

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
this also contributes to the fact that the value of the business is increasing.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
In general, we can say that increasing the value of the business

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
is the ultimate goal of most companies.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Or increasing the well-being of shareholders,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
which is basically the same, you can put an equal sign.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
So, at the first stage,

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
we understand, we have agreed on what financial results we want to achieve.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
After that, we can move on to the second stage,

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
in which we discuss a very problematic issue,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
who and what we will sell,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
who is our target client,

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
what target audiences we are oriented to,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
and what should our product portfolio look like

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
in order to get the money that we want to earn from our clients.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
So, the second stage is called product clients.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Two main questions,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
what are the target audiences we want to achieve,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
and what should our product portfolio look like.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Let's look at this again using the example of a company

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
that works in the kitchen furniture market.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
As we can see, the company strives for the leading positions in the target segments.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
But a few words about this business.

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
In principle, the kitchen furniture market can be divided into three segments.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
There is the economy class segment,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
there is the comfort class segment,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
and there is the premium class segment.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Well, this is the difference between the kitchen and the price.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
The company works in the comfort class,

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
and it works both in the capital and in the regions.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
The company has quite ambitious goals,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
it wants to be a leader both in the capital and in the regions.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
This is fixed in the goal,

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
leading positions in the target segments.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
A very important point in the second projection is to understand

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
what are the main factors that affect the satisfaction of our customers.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
In this business, we see that the satisfaction of the customers of the kitchen furniture comfort class

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
is influenced by how they are serviced in the salon by the sellers,

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
how quickly the order is made,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
what is the waiting time for the furniture.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
The third point is very important,

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
it is the design and individuality of the project.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
I want the kitchen I ordered to be individual,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
sharpened millimeter by millimeter in size,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
individual in design, and so on.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
It is clear that this product should be functional and high-quality.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
In addition, a very important point is the service support.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
We can refer to the service as delivery, kitchen, installation,

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
as well as post-sale warranty service.

27:36.000 --> 27:43.000
So, we prescribe 7 main factors that affect the satisfaction of the customers in this segment.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
This is a very important point,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
because the readers of the card, the staff,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
walking around the office past this card,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
can clearly understand what other factors affect the satisfaction of our entire audience.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Once again, this is the service in the salon,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
the efficiency of the order,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
design and performance,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
functionality, quality, service and warranty.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
In principle, this list can be considered a technical task,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
a technical task for the third projection,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
in which we prescribe the goals for business processes.

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
The third goal in this project is to expand the range.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
The company has only produced kitchen furniture,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
the average price range in the comfort class,

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
but in the near future it is going to expand the range,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
supplement it with children's furniture and bathroom furniture.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
One of the target segments of the company is young families,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
who recently bought an apartment,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
first of all, they bought a kitchen,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
soon they will have a baby,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and the baby needs furniture,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
so if you work with them in the kitchen,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
they will be loyal,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
and in a few years you can sell children's furniture to the same people.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
The company's leadership considers it advisable to expand the range,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
to add kitchen furniture to the children's,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
today it is a kitchen, tomorrow it is a children's,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
and bathroom furniture.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
In general, the company has three main goals for the client's projection of the product,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
the first is to increase the satisfaction of the clients,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
we understand what it consists of,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
this is a very important point,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
if we increase the satisfaction of the clients,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
we will consolidate our leading positions,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
and we will achieve this in the leading positions in the target segments,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
there are two types of companies,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
the capital and the regions,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and the second goal,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
which contributes to the achievement of leading positions in the target segments,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
is to expand the range.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
It should be noted that in the second projection,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
in fact, the company lists all those counter-agents

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
with whom it is necessary to build relations

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
in order to earn the profit that we want to earn,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
in the first projection.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
In addition to clients,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
we said that it could be state structures,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
it could be society,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
it could be all kinds of partners,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
it could be suppliers.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
If the business of the company

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
depends very much on the relationship with the state,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
then the second projection is divided into two parts,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
it will be called clients of the state,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and the companies write,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
and they will be able to build relations with the state,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
officials, and so on.

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
Society can also be part of the second projection,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
if, for example, the business of the company

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
causes damage to the ecological character,

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
if the company is engaged in the production of products

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
and the organization of the company may not like it,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
then in any case, the company has to build relations

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
with the organization of Greenpeace,

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
and this will be said in the second projection.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Partners.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
For example, the business school

31:19.000 --> 31:27.000
in its field can base its strategy

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
on very close relations with partner structures

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
from other countries,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
business schools from Europe and America,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
the diplomas of which it presents on some territory.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It is very important for this business school

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
to maintain very good relations with its partners,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
the diplomas of which it offers to customers on the local market.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
Or suppliers can be very important for the company.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
For example, the company presents a product

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
of some manufacturer on a certain market,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
and would not like this manufacturer

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
to sell this product to some other dealer.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Therefore, it will be written in the map

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
to create long-term partnership relations with the supplier

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
and not to allow him to sell his own product to someone else,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
except us.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
In principle, the state, society, partners, suppliers

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
can be added to the second projection.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
The third projection is the business process projection.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
We will consider it again using the example of the company

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
that produces kitchen furniture.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
In the large cell, the business of the company

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
consists of 14 processes.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
Nine of them belong to the category of primary.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
The primary processes are those that participate

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
in the creation of values for a certain target audience.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
In particular, this is market research,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
branding,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
interior design,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
interior layout on the ant trail,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and its correct design.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
This is within the process number three.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Within the process number four,

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
the company receives and processes the customer's order.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
The customer comes to the salon, chooses and designs the kitchen.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
The final design is completed within the process number five.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
The sixth process is the purchase of resources.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
The seventh is the production.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Within the eighth process,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
the delivery of the kitchen and its installation are carried out.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
The ninth is the warranty and post-warranty service.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
These are the main processes that form the value for the client.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
In addition, the company has auxiliary service providers.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Five of them were selected.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
BP-10, security system,

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
legal support for business and construction in relation to the state,

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
the 11th is the IT and information system,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
the 12th is the financial system,

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
the 13th is the management of the staff,

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
and the 14th is the general management.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
It is very useful to define the business process

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
before writing the goals in the business process project.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
The question we ask ourselves

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
when we formulate the goals in the business process project

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
is what changes in the chain of our business processes

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
we should make to achieve the goals in the client and staff project.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
The company we are considering

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
has come to the conclusion that the goals in the business process project

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
will be the following.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
The goal is to improve the quality and functionality of the product.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
This goal will probably always be correct.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
There is no limit to perfection.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
The company is also going to pay attention to the quality of its product

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
and its functionality.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
A very important point in their business is the speed of order execution.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
How fast we make the food for our client.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
This is a very important factor of competitive struggle

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
and a very important factor of influencing the customer satisfaction.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
Therefore, the goal of increasing the speed of order execution is also very important.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Service support of customers,

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
delivery, kitchen installation, kitchen and post-sale service

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
are also very important.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Therefore, there is a goal to increase the level of service.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
The company is already well-established,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
but there is no limit to perfection.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Therefore, further work is also necessary.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
An important point in the business is the places where the salons are placed,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
how they are designed and how they work.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
The expansion of the network of salons in the capital and in the regions

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
is also a very important goal.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
One of the features of the company is that,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
unlike most competitors,

36:22.000 --> 36:29.000
the company is trying to offer the client ultra-new things in the field of design and technology.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
The company is actively learning from the leaders of its industry,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
from the Italians, Germans, Scandinavians,

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
and offers new ideas in the local market from the field of design or technology

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
of product manufacturing.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Therefore, the goal of introducing designer and technological innovations

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
in their business model is also very important.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
In principle, we see that all these five goals

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
contribute to the strengthening of the brand of the company.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
The success factor in business is also very important.

37:12.000 --> 37:18.000
The company has formulated two more goals from the service process.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
The company is beginning a stage of reasonable bureaucratization.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
This involves the creation of a controlling system

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
and the construction of a system for quality management and the implementation of corporate standards.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
The company has passed the stage of rapid growth.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
The growth is slowly ending.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
The stage of maturity is coming.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
The management of the company believes it is very important

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
to carry out reasonable bureaucratization of the company.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
After understanding what goals we should achieve in the business process,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
we can think about what kind of personnel we need,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
with what competencies to achieve these goals.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
And we, accordingly, move on to the fourth and last projection,

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
which is usually called the infrastructure personnel.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
The question is what competencies we need,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
what we want from the personnel,

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
and what we should do for it to be inspired, motivated,

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
and to give 100-120% to achieve the goals in the business process,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
in clients and in finance.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
In addition, to achieve the goals in the projection process,

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
we need infrastructure.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
This is all that the personnel will have in their hands,

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
everything they need to complete the tasks that we want them to do.

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
We see that this furniture factory strives to increase the personnel qualification.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
This is always the right goal.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
In this case, the company will pay more attention to the qualification of production personnel.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
The personnel who are engaged in marketing and sales,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
as well as their own designers.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
In any case, we have to think about the satisfaction of the personnel,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
about their motivation, this is also a very important goal.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
There are two goals in terms of infrastructure.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
The company implements modern IT systems, there are three of them.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
The IT design system is implemented,

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
the system that supports management accounting and budget is implemented,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and the CRM system is implemented.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
Another goal of the company in terms of infrastructure is to expand production.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The company has one production site,

39:40.000 --> 39:47.000
but it wants to have three production centers in the strategic perspective,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
and two need to be built.

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
This is what the set of strategic goals of this furniture factory looks like.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Robert Kaplan says that 20 is plenty.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
He believes that in 20 sentences we can formulate our own strategy.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
We must declare 20 main goals, plus or minus.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
They are connected by a logical cause-and-effect relationship.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
If we achieve the goals in the design of personnel,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
then it contributes to the achievement of the goals in the design of processes.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Achieving the goals in the design of processes contributes to the achievement of the goals in the design of clients.

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
And finally, all this works to ensure that we earn the profit we want to earn.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
Next, I would like to offer you a very interesting survey results,

40:48.000 --> 40:56.000
which was conducted by Pricewaterhouse, a consulting company among European companies.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
The question asked by the businessman was as follows.

41:01.000 --> 41:10.000
What indicators do you consider to be critically important in terms of the strategy you are pursuing in your industry?

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
The question was not asked what indicators you use in your practice.

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
The question was what indicators are critically important in your business,

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
given that you have such a strategy.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Let's go through four projections.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The first one is the financial projection.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
As you can see on this graph, the most popular indicator is the profit.

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
80% of respondents say that, given that we have such a strategy,

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
it is our turn to make a significant contribution.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
The second most popular indicator in the financial section is the operating profit.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Companies strive to achieve the goal of operating profit.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
Operating profit is usually called the profit that the company earns

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
under the so-called operating activities,

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
without taking into account other income and other expenses from other sources.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
If we consider a business related to the transportation of people from point A to point B,

42:15.000 --> 42:27.000
the operating profit in this business is the profit that the air carrier earns from the sale of tickets to the plane.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
In addition, the air carrier can add other income.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
It can be the sale of drinks and jewelry on the plane,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
it can be advertising on the plane,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
it can be other sources of income.

42:42.000 --> 42:49.000
But the operating profit in this business is the profit from the transportation of people from point A to point B.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
The third most popular indicator is the cash flow.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
If we get the profit from the calculation of profits and losses,

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
then we get the cash flow from the calculation of the movement of money.

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
It is important to remember the recommendation of the American financier Alfredo Rapoport.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I want to mention it again.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Profit is opinion, cash is fact.

43:10.000 --> 43:18.000
The profit is the opinion due to the fact that it can be calculated in different ways due to the nuances of accounting policy.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
The cash flow is considered very simple,

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
it is the difference between the money that was earned in the company at the expense of the accounts in the cash register

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
and the money that was withdrawn from the company during this period.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
The fourth most popular parameter is the profitability of the investment in capital.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
It is the so-called ROI, Return on Investment,

43:42.000 --> 43:50.000
when we compare the profit earned during the period with the capital that was in the business during this period and which generated this profit.

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
34% of the interviewed businessmen consider this indicator to be critically important.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
The next parameter was mentioned as the order receipt.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
We can say that this is the amount of orders that the company currently has.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
For example, we produce kitchen furniture and we are currently provided with orders for this amount.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Some orders we have already almost completed,

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
some are in 50% readiness, some are already ready, some we have not started yet.

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
The amount of all the orders that we have at the moment is the value of this parameter.

44:29.000 --> 44:42.000
Further, 27% of the interviewed businessmen say that the critically important indicator in their practice is the indicator of the added economic value.

44:42.000 --> 44:50.000
This is the economic profit that we consider to be the minus of the so-called added costs.

44:50.000 --> 45:00.000
This value differs from the so-called accounting profit by the percentage that we calculate for the value of our own capital.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
The idea here is quite simple.

45:04.000 --> 45:15.000
A shareholder makes a profit when the income in the place where he has money exceeds the expenses in this place and the unpaid income in another place.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
This unpaid income in another place is subtracted together with the expenses from the income of this company.

45:22.000 --> 45:32.000
As a result, we have the so-called economic profit or the English equivalent of economic value added.

45:34.000 --> 45:42.000
Another parameter that is critically important for 22% of the interviewed companies is the profitability of sales.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
This is the share of the profit in turnover.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
What margin do we work with?

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
The last indicator, which is the most popular, is the profitability of our own capital.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
ROE is the profitability of the capital in business, both personal and debt-related.

46:01.000 --> 46:11.000
If we calculate the ROE, we can say how effectively we have worked out the money of the owner,

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
only the money of the owner invested in our company.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
The projection of the client and product.

46:20.000 --> 46:28.000
Here, if we believe the results of the survey, the most popular indicator is the customer satisfaction index.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
94% of the interviewed businessmen said that they consider this indicator to be critically important.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
This is understandable, because in competitive markets it is very important for companies to build relationships with their customers.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
It is important to think every day about how satisfied they are with us and how loyal they are to us.

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
This indicator cannot be obtained from the balance sheet of the report on profits and losses or the report on the movement of money.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
We can get this indicator only by conducting a survey of our clients.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
Usually, this is a certain point estimate on a certain scale, for example, 10 points.

47:10.000 --> 47:17.000
In the last year and a half, I was involved in the collection of procedures from different companies and industries,

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
how companies in their industry, in their business, are trying to calculate this increase.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
With what periodicity, according to what method.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
I will be glad to offer you these developments.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
The first example is the company that produces lasers.

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
For medical and scientific purposes, the company works with both dealers and end customers.

47:41.000 --> 47:51.000
Periodically, the company sends a simple survey to its clients, A4 format, one-page only.

47:52.000 --> 48:00.000
In this survey, the company asks its dealers and end customers to give it a point for the design of its device,

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
for its quality, for its functionality, for the terms of execution of the order, for service support, and so on.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Dear customers, give us a point on a 10-point scale.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
One minimum, 10 maximum, according to each of the parameters that we included in this survey.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
In addition to giving points, the customers can also leave comments.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
I give you 8 points, I explain why.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
I give you 5 points for the design, I explain why.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
And the last question in this survey is very interesting.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
They call it a rating.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
In this last survey, they ask customers to give a total score, a general, average, for everything,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
and give points to competitors.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
If a customer works with competitors, then the customer can give a point not only to the company, but also to the competitors.

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
The company wants to understand whether it is just as poor as everyone else, or whether it looks better or worse against the background of competitors.

48:57.000 --> 49:07.000
Many customers send feedback and say that we give you an 8 on a 10-point scale on average,

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
and to some of our competitors we give 5, 6, and 10.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
Something similar is done by a company engaged in logistics services.

49:19.000 --> 49:26.000
The company has a client base of about 1500 clients,

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
of which about 1200 are stable clients, with whom the company works constantly,

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
and 300 are disposable clients who come and go.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
Once the company decided to measure the satisfaction of its own clients,

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
it also developed a survey, also one-page only,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
at the top was an appeal to the respected client,

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
we thank you for your cooperation with us for the last 5 years,

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
we sincerely strive to become better, please help us in this.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Please answer the following questions.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
At the bottom, thank you very much for your cooperation with the respected CEO.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
The CEO personally signed 1500 letters to the client,

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
not on a printer, but by hand.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
They put this survey in an envelope, put a New Year's card in it,

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
and sent 1500 letters to their clients.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
As far as I remember, 8 surveys were returned.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
8 surveys, a very small percentage of the return was.

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
The company came to the conclusion that it made two mistakes.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
The first mistake was on New Year's Eve,

50:48.000 --> 50:58.000
the client does not have time to answer questions of the partners they work with,

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
and the second moment they decided that by mail it was unsuccessful.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
If it was by email, it would probably be better,

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
it would be easier for the client to tick in Word and send back by email.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
After a while, they repeated this procedure,

51:15.000 --> 51:22.000
and after sending 1500 letters to the client, they received 120 filled out surveys.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
120 feedbacks, a fairly thick folder, there is something to think about.

51:28.000 --> 51:35.000
Some companies that want to calculate this figure,

51:35.000 --> 51:42.000
ask themselves how we can stimulate our clients so that they answer these questions.

51:43.000 --> 51:51.000
One company that produces shoes tried to solve this issue in the following way.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
When they sell shoes to clients, they have their own production and their own retail.

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
In stores, when customers buy shoes, they are given a piece of paper, a survey,

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
and they say that when you wear shoes, you will understand how it suits you.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
You can ask them to fill out the survey,

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
they have a 5-point scale, 1-5 maximum, and send it back.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
If you do this, you will become a participant in the draw.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
Win a baseball, win a microwave, win a hairdryer, and so on.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
Those who send them a survey, they become a contender for a microwave.

52:29.000 --> 52:37.000
When we looked at the entire volume of letters sent back with the commercial director,

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
the average score was quite high, 4.9-4.8.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
The commercial director thinks that there was a mistake.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
A client who puts 3-2 points in his heart,

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
most likely, wishing to win a microwave, will put 5 points.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
He has a suspicion that if he puts a real score of 2, 3, or 4,

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
he will be automatically excluded from the list of contenders for this famous microwave.

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
What other procedures can be used to calculate the value of this indicator?

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
Car sales.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Car dealer.

53:21.000 --> 53:29.000
At each point where cars are sold and their service is carried out,

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
a computer is installed.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
The computer is called an e-book of reviews.

53:35.000 --> 53:44.000
Each passenger or each client who has moved their car for repair

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
can come to this computer, formulate their own feedback,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
what they think about the company, put a point, press Enter.

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
Information is sent online to the general director's office.

53:59.000 --> 54:08.000
The general director can collect information from all the car dealers within 2 seconds.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
An alternative procedure in this business is a phone survey.

54:13.000 --> 54:19.000
Clients brought their car for repair, left it for a number of days,

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
and a few days later they get a call from the call center.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
The employees ask how they liked their car, what complaints they had,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
what they could say, what score they could give.

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
Another procedure can be used in retail.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
Imagine a hypermarket.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
Clients have made some purchases, leave the store,

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
and there is a ballot box at the exit.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
There is a poster next to it.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Don't pass by, help us become better.

54:56.000 --> 55:02.000
The poster urges clients to throw a red, yellow or green piece of paper into the ballot box.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
If everything is fine, no complaints, the client throws a green piece of paper.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
If there were any complaints, everything is fine, he throws a yellow one.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
If there are any terrible problems, the client can throw a red piece of paper.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
A small one.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
It is clear that clients do not write on these pieces of paper why they throw a yellow or red piece of paper.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
Every Friday, the management of the company collects these ballot boxes from all the stores

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and throws them on the table in their office.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
It monitors the percentage of green, red and yellow.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
This is so-called light artillery.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
If the percentage of red and yellow becomes too high,

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
the so-called heavy artillery enters.

55:45.000 --> 55:52.000
Then the employee at the checkout spends some time at the exit from the hypermarket

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
and asks the client to fill in the questionnaire,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
to put a point for this, for that, for that.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
Only after the questionnaire do you understand what problems you have.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
But as a light artillery, these red, yellow and green pieces of paper can be used.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
We see that 94% of the businessmen who have been approached

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
consider this indicator to be critically important.

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
94% of companies understand that in highly competitive markets

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
it is extremely important to get feedback from their own clients.

56:27.000 --> 56:34.000
The market share is in second place in terms of popularity.

56:34.000 --> 56:40.000
The third place in terms of popularity is the share of timely deliveries.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
A large percentage of respondents believe that it is very important to serve clients on time

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
and monitor these indicators.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
The volume of sales to new clients

56:52.000 --> 56:58.000
tells us whether we can attract new customers.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
The same popularity of the indicators, the volume of sales,

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
or the number of regular customers,

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
tells us whether we can maintain the client base.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
The number of advertisements can be an inexpensive substitute

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
for the customer satisfaction index.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
Some companies refuse to measure the customer satisfaction index,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
replacing it with the number of advertisements.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
The problem is that not all clients send advertisements.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
They may simply not send, but never come back.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Some clients send advertisements, but we are not satisfied with it.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
There are clients who just leave, and we don't want that.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Let's move on to the business process projection.

57:38.000 --> 57:45.000
Let's look at the indicators that companies from different branches

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
consider critically important in their practice.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
The first place is the share of marriage and quality.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
It is clear that this is a very popular indicator.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
The second place is the popularity of sales to new products.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
44% of respondents say that this is a very important indicator

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
in their business, taking into account their strategy.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
What does it say?

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
I think it tells us how innovative the company is.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
There is a point of view that if about 30% of the company's sales

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
are to new products or services that we have offered

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
to our clients this year, we can consider ourselves

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
an age-old business.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
Nobody wants to get old, they want to be young forever.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
In principle, this is one of the indicators of the company's youth.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
If it is able to launch popular products and services

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
to the market year by year, update its line,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
it can be considered as not aging.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
This is a very important indicator.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
The third place is the time to market indicator.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
It tells us about the time that the company needs

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
to cover the entire distance.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
It tells us from the moment of the idea that it would be good

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
to launch a product or service to the market.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
Until the moment of the offer of the product or service

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
to the final buyer.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
This is a very important parameter in many industries.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
It is important that the chain of processes works very fast.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
That the researchers and designers

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
quickly come up with the product,

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
that the production quickly develops,

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
that the buyers quickly buy,

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
that the production quickly does,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
that the logistics works like a clock.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
Someone from the managers said that in the 21st century

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
there will be only two types of companies,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
fast and dead.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
If we do not want to be dead, we must be fast.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
We need to know how much time our company needs

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
to cover the distance.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
From the moment of the idea to the moment of the offer

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
of a new product or service to the target audience.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The time of processing of orders is a piece of the time to market.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
It is how much time we need to complete the order.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It is a very popular indicator.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
We can see the number of orders

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and the number of orders.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It is a proof of innovation.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The company is moving forward with the modern technologies.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Let's look at the popular indicators of the last projection.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The projection of the staff.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The company tries to understand the state of its staff.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The first place is the indicator

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
called the employee satisfaction index.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It is very similar to the customer satisfaction index.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It allows the businessman to get feedback.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Before, the businessman received feedback from the clients.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Now the businessman receives feedback from the staff.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
The staff informs the employer about their feelings,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
what they like and what they do not like.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
One well-known German company

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
uses three procedures to measure the satisfaction of its employees.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Every day, the office workers turn off their computers

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
and click on one of the physiognomies on the monitor.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The monitor asks how satisfied the employees were with their work.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
If the employee is satisfied,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
he clicks on the smiling green physiognomy.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
If he is not satisfied,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
he clicks on the sad red physiognomy.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
If there were problems,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
but there was also something good today,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
he clicks on the yellow physiognomy.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
This is also a so-called light artillery.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The employer is not able to understand

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
why the employees clicked on the sad red physiognomy.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Therefore, heavy artillery is periodically launched.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is a survey.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Twice a year, a detailed survey is carried out in this company.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The employees can fill out a large survey.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
There are 8 pages.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The employer asks the employees,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
using a six-digit scale,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
what they think about the working conditions,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
how much they like the work,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
what are the career opportunities that the company provides to employees,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
how to build relationships with the management,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
how satisfied they are with the assortment of salads in the canteen.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The employees use a six-digit scale

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and can leave their comments,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
if they have time,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
not just tick, but also write comments.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
The procedure can be anonymous.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
The employer does not force you to sign.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Firstly, no one forces you to fill out a survey.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Secondly, no one forces you to sign.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Thirdly, the procedure used by this company

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
to calculate the satisfaction index of its employees

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
is a special urn in the corridor,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
where employees can leave their comments every day.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
They can formulate everything they want on a piece of paper in A4 format

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
and leave it there.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The employer can sign it or not,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
but I want it to work.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The employer knows that he wants to change the company.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
In the 21st century, there are too many businesses

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
where everything is decided by the staff,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
where there is no equipment,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
and the main resource is not software.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
The main resource is the staff,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
people, and the employers must do a lot

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
to make the employees feel comfortable.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Many companies pay attention to this indicator,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and periodically calculate the satisfaction index

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
of their employees.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
One of my businessmen,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
who works in the IT business,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
measures the satisfaction of his employees

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
using a specific method.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
The company works on the junction of two industries.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It is a mix of advertising agency and IT company.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
One of the products of this company is a website.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
The company is operated by both IT specialists and creatives.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
If this company is left to either IT specialist or creatives,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
the business will be in a very difficult situation.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The manager has a rule.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
He invites each employee to dinner or dinner party

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
twice a year.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
At least once every six months.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The boss invites each employee to dinner party.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
The company is not a business.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
The company is not a business.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The boss invites employees to dinner party.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
The boss treats the employees.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The boss tries to understand what the employees like,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
what they don't like, what they can do for the employees,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
what problems they have.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
The boss gives the employees an opportunity to speak.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
The company has a very important procedure.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
The company tries to get feedback from the employees.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The second place is the popularity of the performance indicators.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
If the performance index is a bit ahead,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
the performance is a bit behind.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
It is too late to drink a beer when the employees have already voted.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
We should use the performance index.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
The performance indicator is a very important factor.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
The performance indicator is important for 47% of the businessmen.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
37% of the businessmen think that the performance indicator

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
is very important for the disease.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
People get sick as much as they have time.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The company pays for it.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
The company pays for it.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
The company pays for it.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
If the company pays for it,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
the employees would not want to get sick.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The company pays for it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
The company pays for it.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
31% of the employees voted.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I liked the idea of visualization of management accountability.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
In every structure of the company,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
in logistics, accounting, marketing,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
there is a glass jar on the window sill.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
There are tennis balls in it.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Usually, there are several balls in every structure.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
In one department there are 8 balls, in another 2 balls, in the third one there are 14 balls.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
But everyone has something in this jar.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
There are two colors of balls, white and orange.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The white balls inform us about the number of proposals

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
that the employees of this department have made for the management of the company.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
The orange ones are the proposals that have been implemented.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
We come to the accounting department in July.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
There are 4 balls in the jar.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
3 white balls and 1 orange ball.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
What does it mean?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
The accounting department has submitted proposals 3 times,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
but they were not accepted for some reason.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The idea of accounting was realized,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
it worked, it brought an economic effect.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
If it happened, the accounting department has the right to put this orange ball in its jar.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
We come to the logistics department.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
There are 8 balls, 6 orange and 2 white.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The ideas that came from the logistics department were listened to,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
but not accepted.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
6 ideas were accepted, implemented, earned, brought some economic effect.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
The chief logistics officer proudly shows his colleagues a glass jar,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
where in July there are already 8 balls.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The revenue per person is also a very popular indicator.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
How much money does one employee bring us?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The productivity of labor was also noted as a very important indicator.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
17% of businessmen in Europe were employed.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
As an example of what can be in the second projection,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
except for the above-mentioned ones,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I would like to offer you a sample of the system of balanced indicators

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
of the football club of the Russian Federation.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
The head of the football club Erwin Staudt

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
told me that all the businesses in this hall

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
are very simple compared to the business of the football club.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The main business is football.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The main business is football.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The main business is football.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The main business is football.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The main business is football.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Most companies in their business need to build relations with clients and suppliers.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And if you are in charge of a football club,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
you need to build relations not only with clients, but also with fans.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
There is a very interesting part for the audience,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
it's the fans, with whom you need to build specific relations.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But in addition to the clients, the head of the football club

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
has to build relations with the European Football Association,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
with the International Football Federation,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
with TV channels, sponsors, agents who can steal football players.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
According to Erwin Staudt, he has to build relations with his own mother-in-law.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
According to Erwin Staudt, he has to build relations with his own mother-in-law.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
She periodically calls him at 11.30 a.m.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
in the middle of the working day,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
and asks him,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
why didn't you play last season?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I'm very sorry for him,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm afraid he has an injury or something happened to him.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Erwin Staudt asked the audience,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
how long has it been since your mother-in-law called you at 11.30 a.m.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and asked how your financial director was doing.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The content of these cards

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
is the same for two companies from the same industry.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
There are two or three companies

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
that are direct competitors,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and work in the same industry.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The projection of the finances

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
can be absolutely the same.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Most companies say that they have a profit,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
cash flow, and we want to invest more

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
so that the shareholders' well-being is better.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The indicators may differ,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
because some companies are focused on earning billions,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
some companies are satisfied with millions,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
and some companies are satisfied with thousands.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It's worth mentioning that in most industries

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
you can earn money in different ways.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Some industries earn money in thousands,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
and some industries earn money in a way that is less.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But the way we earn money

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
is defined in the projection of the client's products,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
business processes, and infrastructure.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Let's take a look at this topic.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
A company produces lasers for medicine and science.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
A company can work in three formats.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The first format is leadership in costs.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
The company is quite simple,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
solid, and unpretentious.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It's called a laser.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
It's a standard, inexpensive,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and quite good laser.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This is the scenario of the company's development.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It can be written in projection 2, 3, and 4.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The company can rely on innovation.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It can rely on investing a lot of money

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
in research and innovation.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It can rely on investing a lot of money

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
in research and innovation.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
It can rely on investing a lot of money

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
in research and innovation.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The third scenario is to go into the so-called

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
in-poshive, the so-called customization

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
of laser production for each specific customer.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
These are the companies that serve customers

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
who want a laser to be yellow,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
so that the angles are round,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
and the lamp is moved a little to the left.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
This is the kind of laser I want.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's not innovative, but it's tailored to my specific needs.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
In this business, the company has three formats of work.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
One of them it has to choose for itself

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and write it down in the client-product projection,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
business process, and personal infrastructure.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
We can say that 80% of the direct competitors' cards

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
match, but 20% we leave for some differences,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
nuances that are important for one business

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and less important for another.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
There are companies of the so-called first echelon,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
whose business is largely made up of processes,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
purchasing resources, production, branding,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
sales, and distribution logistics.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
There are companies with a chain

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
that pay more attention to two processes,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
neocor and branding.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
There are companies of the second echelon

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
that don't spend a penny on neocor,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
but bet on the release of branded generics.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Their business will consist of purchasing resources,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
production, branding, sales, and distribution logistics.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And finally, there are companies of the third echelon

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
that refuse not only neocor, but also branding.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Their business will consist of purchasing resources,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
production, sales, and distribution logistics.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So, in each industry, the same money

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
can be earned in several ways.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Our specific way is what we prescribe in our card.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Our specific way is what we prescribe in our card.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
We have a specific way of making money.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Our competitor can prescribe it in a different way.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Our third competitor can prescribe it in a different way.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
It is important to understand this.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
The conclusion I want to make is that

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
80% of the cards of direct competitors match.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
20% I leave for the difference.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Companies cannot be the same.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Companies cannot be the same.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Each business should have some difference from the competitor.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The concept of strategy revolves around the concept of uniqueness.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Another important point when developing a card

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
is the methodology and work with people

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
who create this card.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Many companies have a need to leave the company

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
once a year for 2-3 days,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
turn off their mobile phones,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and think about how to live.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Many companies do it more often.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
But, perhaps, once a year this card needs to be updated.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
The format can be as follows.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
15-20 main managers

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
leave for 2-3 days,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
turn off their mobile phones,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
and work in mini-groups to create a card.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
If 15-20 people participate in this process,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
it can be divided into 3-4 groups.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Each mini-group will have someone from finance,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
logistics, production, marketing.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
The first task is to suggest

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
a version of what should be in the finance department.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
What financial goals should we set?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
What indicators should we use?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
There are mini-groups A, B, and C.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We listen to these 3 opinions,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
discuss them, and make a compromise.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
We put a check mark and move on to the second project.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We work in mini-groups again.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
These 3 groups work in parallel,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and develop their vision of what should be in the product department.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Who are our clients? Who are not our clients?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
What should the product portfolio look like?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
What positions do we want to achieve in the market?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
This is a compromise.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
If we work according to this scheme,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
a lot of ideas are born in mini-groups.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
People accumulate a lot of good ideas

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
in 12-11 months.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
They come to this meeting like chemists.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
It is important for them to get their ideas out of their cheeks.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
The list of ideas can be quite large.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
The authors of this method say

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
that a map should include 20 key goals.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Big business goals.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
There can be a lot of ideas in groups.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
When we discuss these ideas after working in mini-groups,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
these ideas have 3 ways.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Some ideas can be included in the top level,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
in the company's overall map.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Some ideas can be included in the structure department's map.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Some ideas can be included in the trash bin.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I was present at the development of a legal company's map.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The company provides legal services.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
We work in mini-groups.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
One of the ideas was to replace the carpet in the reception room.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It is a claimant's idea.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It is one of the problems of the company.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Customers come to the office,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
wait for their meeting with their consultants.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
They are offered to look through the magazine,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
drink coffee, sit on the couch,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
and say that the carpet in the office has not been changed for a long time.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
It is dirty and needs to be replaced.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
The head of the department can handle this task.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Such things are not included in the corporate strategic goals map.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
It is one of the activities that contributes to the achievement of larger goals.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
These goals are recorded in the top level map.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Such ideas are sent to the structure department at the discussion stage.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
There are things that are included in the trash bin.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Here are a couple of examples.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The business is selling spare parts for cars.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
The main competence is selling spare parts.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
One of the managers believes that the company should try itself out

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
in the STO market, in the technical service market,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
in the car repair market.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
The company believes that this is a fundamentally different business.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It seems that everything is simple in this business.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
The company does not believe that we should do this.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
We will not get there.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
This idea, which claims the status of a strategic goal,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
ended up in the trash bin.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Another example is kitchen furniture.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
The company has made comfort kitchen furniture.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
They cost a certain amount of money.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Some employees of the company think that it makes sense to try to earn something

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
in another segment, in the premium segment.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
An idea came up, an offer came up to formulate a goal

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
to expand the product portfolio of premium kitchen furniture.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
After a long discussion, it was decided to refuse.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
For a number of reasons, the same idea ended up in the trash bin.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
When we develop ideas in groups that claim to get into the top-level map,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
not everyone will get there.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
They can get into the trash bin and into the map of the division structure.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Peter Horvat, one of the gurus who writes books on this topic,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and does a lot of implementation of this system,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
offers a so-called Horvat filter.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
He offers businessmen to structure ideas in groups

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
in four fields of a simple matrix.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
He offers to evaluate ideas in terms of how complex they are

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
in terms of practical implementation.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Do we need to spend a lot of money on this?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Do we need to spend a lot of money on this?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Do we need to spend a lot of effort, a lot of money,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
a lot of time to implement these ideas?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
This is the first variable for creating a matrix.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
The second variable is the influence on competitiveness.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
How seriously these ideas that were developed in groups

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
will contribute to the growth of competitiveness of our business.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
The matrix is made up of four squares.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
The first square is the idea that is not complex in terms of practical implementation.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
The company should not spend a lot of money, effort,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and time to implement them.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
But even if it does, the company does not grow significantly.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
This is the first square.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
The second square is the idea that is complex in terms of practical implementation,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
but does not contribute to the significant growth of business competitiveness.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
One company was offered to move to a new office.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
In the suburbs, somewhere you want to move to the city center.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
It costs a lot of money, but after discussion,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
they decided that there would be no radical breakthrough in competitiveness.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
This is an example of the second square,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
where the ideas of the two companies will be developed.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
The third square is the idea that is complex in terms of practical implementation.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
The ideas are expensive, but do not contribute to the growth of business competitiveness.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
At least in this period.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
The third square is the idea that costs a penny,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
is inexpensive in terms of resources, time, and is not complex in terms of implementation.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But if we do this, it will significantly increase the competitiveness of our company.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And finally, the fourth square is the ideas that are complex and expensive in terms of practical implementation.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
But if we do this, it will again contribute to the growth of business competitiveness.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And it is quite clear that we are discussing two squares,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
which we have listed as ideas that contribute to the growth of business competitiveness.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
There are no expensive ones, no complex ones,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but first of all, we must introduce and fix in the cards

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
those phrases that are designed to increase the competitiveness of our business.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Such a simple tool,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
but it is very useful for the development of business competitiveness.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
It is a very simple tool,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
it helps businessmen to create a card,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and helps them to bring their own ideas into a certain system.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I highly recommend it.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So, we have prescribed our own strategic concept in four projections.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
If our company is small,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
in which the leadership of the company can touch any employee,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
then in such companies, as a rule, one card is enough for everyone.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It hangs in the office, everyone walks around it, everyone remembers it, everyone sees it,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and everyone tries to match their own actions

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
with the goals of the business in the corporate card.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
But if the company is large enough,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
then in such a company, as a rule,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
on the basis of the corporate card,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
the corporate cards of the company as a whole are made of the cards, goals and indicators of structural divisions.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
In the methodology, this is called cascading or decomposition.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
That is, it is the creation of such understandable cards for structural divisions.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
For example, the company works on the market of quickly mounted metal structures.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
The building is made of quickly mounted metal structures.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
For example, it can be a logistics center, a production room, a store,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
or a salon where cars are sold.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
The company consists of six main structural divisions.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
This is the sales department, logistics department,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
design department, construction department,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
financial accounting service, and the organizational development service.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Six main structural divisions.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
The corporate card was created,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
and six cards were produced for the main structural divisions.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
For the sales department, for the design department,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
for the logistics department, for the construction department,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
for the financial accounting department, for the organizational development department.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Let's talk about the rules of creating the cards of structural divisions,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
and how the cards of structural divisions are connected with the system of operations.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
The general logic of this work is presented on this slide.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
There is a corporate card,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and we are trying to make cards for the main structural divisions.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Everything here depends on the organizational structure of the company.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
If the company consists of relatively large companies,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
then the company is a company that has a large number of employees.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
If the company consists of a small company,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
then the business units are relatively independent.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Each of them has its own clients.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
For clients, a product portfolio is made.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.000
The business units cards will be the same as the business price cards.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
There will be finances, income minus expenses equals profits.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
There will be external clients that need to be serviced,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
with whom you need to build relations, loyalty to which needs to be increased.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
There will be processes, there will be some kind of personnel policy,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and goals in the area of infrastructure.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
But the company usually has a number of service units,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
accounting, IT department, personnel management department,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
legal department.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
For them, too, cards are needed.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And they also have their own projection of finances.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
All these structural units must fit into the budget.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
If the company lives in the budget, then the accounting, IT, HR,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
personnel management, and legal department have their own budgets.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000
They have their own budgets, which they protected at the meeting of the Budget Committee,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
signed with blood and must fulfill.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Therefore, they also have a projection of finances.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
They all have a projection of processes.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
In accounting, their processes are carried out,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
in IT department, their processes,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
in legal department, their processes.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Everyone also has a projection of personnel.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
People work everywhere, people have some competencies,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
people have some kind of satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
All this needs to be measured, it needs to be managed.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
There is also infrastructure in each department.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
The question is whether there is a projection of the client.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
In many companies, the concept of an internal client is introduced.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And I want to tell you about this using the example of a company that works on the market of buildings

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
made of quickly assembled metal structures.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The organization consists of six main structural units.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Construction, logistics, construction of finances,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and development of the market.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.000
If you look at the map of the goals and indicators of the logistics department in this company,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:56.000
it says that the internal client is to increase the satisfaction of internal clients.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Who is the internal client of the logistics department?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It is a colleague from the structural units.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
He works with the construction department more than with the sales department.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They meet more often, argue more often, cooperate more often.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But in any case, the logistics department in this company communicates with everyone,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000
interacts with everyone, argues with everyone, sometimes there is a conflict with someone.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And the management of the company believes that it is necessary to use an indicator called

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
the satisfaction index of the internal client,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000
which would stimulate the logistics department to increase the satisfaction of the colleagues

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
with whom they have to work.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Once a quarter, the logistics department receives points from the sales department,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.000
from the construction department, from the financial department,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and from the organizational development department.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
These are colleagues at the same level in the hierarchy, plus a point from the general director.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000
The points are evaluated by three parameters.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
The first parameter is the quality of the performance of the duties.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:28.000
The financial director is asked how satisfied he is with the quality of the performance of the duties of the main logistics department.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
How satisfied he is with the quality of the work of the logistics department.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And how satisfied he is with the time of performance of the duties.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:48.000
The second parameter is how satisfied you are with the politeness and friendliness of the logistics department.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So, the three main parameters.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
The quality of the performance of the duties in relation to someone as an internal client.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000
The second parameter is the time of performance of the duties in relation to someone as an internal client.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And the third parameter is politeness and friendliness in the process of corporate communication.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
This is also evaluated by points.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.000
The management hopes that this system will allow the relationship in the team to heal a little.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
If I know that my colleagues from the structural departments will give me points at the end of the quarter,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000
then I try not to use non-normative vocabulary and I am not satisfied with them at all.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:34.000
In fact, this is a circular assessment, because everyone gives a point to everyone and, in turn, gets points from everyone.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:44.000
In principle, this is anonymous, because the logistics department receives points and comments from the structural departments.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
The points are not signed and the comments are not signed either.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
But in principle, as a rule, the logistics department guesses who wrote what comment.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:04.000
But it is very important to write a comment, because the logistics department must understand why they were given such a low point,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
what they need to work on, or why they were given such a high point.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
In this company, this is related to the compensation system.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
The quarterly bonus is tied to this point.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Bonuses start to be added from the average point equal to 7.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.000
That is, if less than 7 points were scored for quality, or for timeliness, or for politeness and friendliness, then there are no bonuses.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Bonuses start to be added quarterly, if the average point is 7.1, 7.2 and so on.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
The more points, the more bonuses.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000
The so-called satisfaction index of the internal client.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The internal clients must be satisfied with the quality of their duties, their timeliness, and the third parameter, politeness and friendliness in the process of corporate communication.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
The conclusion is as follows.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
At the structural level, we observe the same four projections.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
The financial projection.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
There are structural units in which only expenses arise, they must fit into the budget.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
The second projection is the clients.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:32.000
The units at the front will have external clients and internal colleagues, with whom you also need to build relations.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
The second projection is the clients.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:43.000
The units at the front will have external clients and internal colleagues, with whom you also need to build relations.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:56.000
The units at the rear, the service services, will have internal clients, who must be serviced on time and efficiently.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Everyone has a projection of processes and personnel.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:18.000
There are many companies in the world that have built the logic of management of goals and indicators not only for structural units of the second and third levels, but also for individual employees.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Ideally, it looks like this.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Each employee has a diary.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
On the 15th of May, he has some routine tasks for the day.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Call, send a report, do this job, remind the accountant, etc.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
These are some routine tasks for the day.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Ideally, each employee has a daily map of goals and indicators for the year.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It is written that the goals are like this, the indicators are like this, and so it is related to the salary.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Today's actions should be related to the company's goals for the year and to what is written in the company's map.
