WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The need for financing, we return to the sphere of our planning, directly to the planning processes,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
shows a table of money flows.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
This is negative net cash flow per saldo of investment and operational activities,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
so to speak, negative saldo of the real sphere.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
In order to cover these deficits and use certain sources of financing,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
it is necessary to take into account certain components.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Please look at the slide, they are listed.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
First, the presence and size of your own capital,

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
how much of your own money we can invest in the creation of an enterprise or its development.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
On the other hand, the availability of credit financing,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
is there an opportunity to get loans.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
The conditions for lending arise, how much does it cost,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
what kind of insurance is required for a loan,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
do we have such an insurance.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
The target parameter is the maximization of income for the shareholder on capital,

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
that is, the financial manager calculates the profitability of his own capital,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
the action of the financial lever.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Financial investors are always interested in the moment of leaving the business,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
how easy it is to leave the business,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
at what stage can this company be sold,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
at what stage of development this company,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
for what price, will there be buyers.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
It is always very interesting to provide flexibility in financing.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
In any case, if we plan our sources of financing,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
taking into account all these realities,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
we must provide some kind of reserve,

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
if something goes wrong, as we planned,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
it will be possible to change something.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
For this, of course, money is needed.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
The next rule is that banks are the institutions where you will be given money

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
when you do not need it.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Banks are willing to lend to companies that have enough money.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
All these financing solutions form the target structure and the average capital price.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
The contract planning of the table of money flows

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
is a very convenient tool for modeling sources of financing.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Here we see three standard options.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Payment of a single amount at the end of the lending period,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
payment of equal amounts every year for 250 units,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
and the third option is an annuity of payments with equal contributions.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
For us, these orders and financing schedules are not indifferent.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
We need to choose the one that is convenient for us.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Convenient from the point of view of money flows.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
We refer to our table of money flows and look at how,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
depending on how we expect the proceeds to come to us,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
how we will pay,

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
what money flows we will generate in order to pay off the loan.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And accordingly, we choose any of these options,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
the loan repayment schedule,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
we agree with the lender and conclude our special schedule,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
including, for example, the interest rate,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
not from the first period, but after several periods.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
This is especially important for large projects,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
for investment projects, for projects in the creation of enterprises.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
How can an enterprise that has been created today,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
which will be built in 2-5 years,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
start to pay off a loan today?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
This is unrealistic.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Therefore, all these are possible options,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
flexibility in financing and financing realities,

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
what we have, what opportunities we have today in the financial market.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
In general, academically, and in life, this rule is very important,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
whether to take a loan or not.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
This strategic decision that top managers make

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
is related to the actions of the financial lever.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I have already mentioned this several times.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
You know that the financial lever describes the profitability of its own capital.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It is associated with the model of profitability of its own capital,

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
which shows the dependence of the profitability of its own capital

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
on the profitability of assets and financial stability.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Please see, here we have nothing but the coefficient of financial autonomy.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
And the financial lever, which talks about the possibilities of financing,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
about the risks of financing, is involved in this model of profitability.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
The goal of lending, the goal of activity in general,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
is to increase the profitability of shareholders,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
to increase the return on shareholder capital.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
It can be achieved by a risky action,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
risky from the point of view of financial stability,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
by the decision to take an additional loan.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And this decision will be justified if our interest rate on the loan

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
exceeds the already achieved profitability of assets.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
In this case, financial stability changes,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
the share of its own capital is reduced,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
the simplest setting, the simplest numbers can be seen.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
And then we get the growth of the profitability of our own capital.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I will ask you to see the examples in the conspect, in the workbook,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
to see the examples of calculations and modeling of loan calculations,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
and to remember the actions of the financial lever,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
the actions of the profitability model.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
I ask you to analyze these tasks

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
and try to apply them to your reality,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
to the activities of your companies,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
and use them in your practice.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Our main goal is to help solve problems in business.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
We analyze very popularly, very simply.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I try to give you such basics of financial planning,

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
because we have programs, complexes for financial planning, automation.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Of course, no one does anything by hand,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
but in order to use all these tools correctly,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
you need to understand what you want,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
what are the final strategic parameters we want to get.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
We always remember profitability and risk,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
about two components.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Please, our profitability and risk of financial stability.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
A little tour back to the topic that you have already passed in financial management,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
the financial lever.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Thus, we use all the principles of financing,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
all the rules of financing,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
plus the availability of financial tools.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We have our reality,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
whether we can or want to give us loans.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
We choose a convenient financing scheme

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
suitable for our company from the point of view of expected inflows and outflows of funds.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
What do we want to get from this financing?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
We have achieved the strategic goal.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
These issues are solved in the process of routine planning.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
We choose a convenient, I emphasize, scheme of financing,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
not an optimal one.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
We leave the concept of optimal financing to the theorists.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
However, if you want to receive the Nobel Prize,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
this is exactly the area where I wish you success.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Financial flow

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Now, after we have planned the money flows,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
we move on to other documents of the financial plan.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
You have already been asked in Paravia about money flows,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
cash flow, and what's next.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Money flows are the basis of financial planning,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
but in addition to the fact that we make up the money flows,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
we also make up the plan balances and the profit plan.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
These documents are necessary in order to transfer information,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
to exchange information from one form to another.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
It is impossible to make up a plan of money flows without a profit plan.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
In addition, then, according to the entire set of financial documents,

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
we can calculate the financial coefficients

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
corresponding to our strategic goals,

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
analyze the parameters of profitability and risk

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
according to the planned and predicted data,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
and, if necessary, make changes,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
review the planned task,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
and then we can extend all our stages of planning,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
solutions for all stages of planning,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
according to the set strategic parameters,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
according to the tactically established standards.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
So, we are planning the company balance.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
The balance plan is also a table,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
a strategic plan, a forecast balance,

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
which is also a table, different from the accounting form of the balance,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
that is, the positions in the balance are all the same,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
but the balances are also made up for the entire horizon of planning,

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
by year, as a rule, by the end of the year,

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
every planned year, we set out what positions we will have in the balance,

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
and we will make decisions about investments and financing.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
So, in this forecast balance, we will have information

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
about where the funds came from,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
the sources of financing, passives,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
how they were used,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
look at the slide, the balance scheme,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
the asset on the left, the passive on the right,

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
and in the process of planning, it will be more convenient for us to use the passive for the asset.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
So, you see, the logical scheme, what is the balance,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
in passives, the sources of financing,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
in assets, how they were used, investments,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
the passive shows what funds are invested,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
what capital is invested,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
the asset shows what property the enterprise has,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
what other obligations should be in passives,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
what is credited to the owners in passives,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
their own capital,

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
we see that we have two components of one whole,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
financing and investment.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
We see that these are two components of one whole,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
financing and investment.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
There is no investment without financing,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and financing without investment.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Here is our balance,

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
and two sides are equal in balance,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
with equal balance,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
with equal amount in the end.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
The asset structure,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
how do we get the asset structure in the balance,

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
we transfer all our strategic investment decisions here.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
If we buy equipment,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
we get the main funds in the balance.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
If we use leasing,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
we use leasing,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
accordingly, our investments are not reflected.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Leasing is already a current aspect of activity,

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
payments on leasing are reflected in the profit plan,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
in the cost, in the second form of accounting.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
That is, the assets in the balance are connected with the investment plan,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
and with the section of investment activity,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
the table of money flows.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
The balance assets are built in accordance with the decisions made on financing.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
What funds do we use?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Our own capital,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
in the form of initial investments,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
in the form of fixed capital,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
in the form of accumulated profits in the process of activity,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
or in the form of borrowed capital,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
which we use.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
As the enterprise develops,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
in addition to external sources,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
internal sources are reflected in the enterprise balance,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
for example, accumulated profits,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
the capital itself increases.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
If the enterprise works with losses,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
the capital itself is exhausted.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
This is an extremely unfavorable situation.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
We can use such a balance to calculate financial coefficients.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
But not quite in this form,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
it is better to use a converted balance.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Financial coefficients are assumed to be a conversion of the balance.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
How?

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
From the passives, the credit debt is transferred to the assets with a minus sign.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
As if we said that the credit debt covers our need for turnover capital.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
And the turnover assets with the deduction of the credit debt

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
form a pure turnover capital of the enterprise.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And it is in this form,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
as you have on the slide,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
an analytical balance,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
it shows exactly this balance,

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
what funds the enterprise has invested in assets,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
what capital was used,

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
and what property the enterprise has.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Here is the balance.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Where and how is the balance presented?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And, of course, you already know the financing rules.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
We can control the balance

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
by comparing the capital itself with non-turnover assets.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
The gold financing rule.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Capital itself with borrowed capital.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Horizontally and vertically.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Capital itself with borrowed capital.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
We check the financial stability.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
The profit plan.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
The most important document.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The profitability of the enterprise was and remains

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
the most important parameter of the efficiency of the enterprise.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
The profit plan includes both the income and the expense positions.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
It reflects the current results of the enterprise.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
The profit plan is usually made

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
when the enterprise is created only after the start of the production process.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
This reflects the income,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
the income from other types of activities,

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
and the corresponding current costs, costs, expenses.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
In order to make up the profit plan,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
we use production plans,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
marketing plans,

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
and the corresponding budgetary costs.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
We do not consider the budgetary technique within our course.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
It is a separate subject, a separate course.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
But, of course, there is no financial planning without budgets.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
I will ask you to look at the table in detail

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
how the income and expenses of the enterprise are formed.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
It is an expanded table that I have compiled for you in the textbook.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
Another interesting point that can be touched upon is our modernity.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
How do we plan the revenue?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
How do we plan the revenue?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
How do we predict the revenue?

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
First of all, the growth of the revenue is one of the most important goals of many companies.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
A company can set an annual revenue growth of 10%, for example,

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
or set a goal to achieve a certain revenue in 3 years, 5 years, or more.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
To predict the revenue,

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
you can use a very interesting model of achievable growth.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
It is shown on the slide.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
The model is quite complex.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
You can understand how it works by analyzing the example,

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
which is provided in the textbook.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
This model is derived.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
You can trust this model.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
It shows how to develop,

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
how to achieve revenue with certain parameters.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
Moreover, you can use any target parameters in this model,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
such as a certain profitability,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
the turnover of assets,

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
or a target capital structure in relation to your own and borrowed funds.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
The model is very interesting.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Calculations are not difficult.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
You can use the electronic tables to see the calculations.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
The model is used.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
The revenue is calculated.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
If the planned revenue calculated by this model is not enough,

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
does not meet our desires, ambitions, and the accepted strategy,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
we must correct the bias,

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
sacrifice, for example, financial stability,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
and increase the share of borrowed capital.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
The plan of revenue is a tax instrument.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
We determine what taxes we will pay.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
The payment of taxes goes from the plan of revenue to the plan of cash flows,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
as the position of the flow of payment.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
The plan of revenue involves a certain optimization of tax payments.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
Financial managers, taking advantage of the accounting policy,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
adopt a certain accounting policy,

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
which is profitable and purposeful at the moment,

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
use a rich arsenal of revenue maneuvering.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
I recommend you to read the books and chapters of Professor Kovalyov

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
on the issue of revenue management.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
It is a very interesting topic of research.

19:33.000 --> 19:43.000
The qualification of a financial manager is related to the possibility of tax payments optimization.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
We have already mentioned this.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
This includes accelerated monetization, revaluation of the main funds,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
the use of leasing, the use of certain accounting methods,

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
interest rates for credit writing costs, and so on.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
It is very interesting and very useful.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Of course, we all do not like to pay taxes,

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
but we must, because we carry out our activities under the protection of the state,

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
and the state receives its share of our income from us for this.

20:20.000 --> 20:28.000
Another interesting point that we must take into account,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
and I want to draw your attention to, in the framework of the PLAN,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
is, of course, the calculation of cost.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Budgeting, budget technology is a separate topic,

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
but we must take into account the following essential things.

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
We must remember that we have variable and conditional costs in our expenses.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
As soon as we forget about this, we will have distortions,

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
we will have troubles, we will have a bad planning.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Why?

21:06.000 --> 21:14.000
It is not easy to divide variable and conditional costs by their accounting.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
If I ask a student, they will tell me right away,

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
good students, that variable costs are the main salary,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
the main material is the paid salary,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
and the conditional costs are rent, amortization.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes, it is true.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
There are some articles on the current costs that can be attributed to variable and conditional costs,

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
but we still use the word conditional and conditional more often.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
And just to scrupulously divide these costs,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
this is variable, this is conditional,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
in principle, this is not the main goal.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
We need to remember the trends.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
We need to understand that the higher the constant costs,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
the greater the risk of being in excess.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
We remember the actions of the operating lever,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
so we must clearly measure our ambitions,

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
for example, to rent an office in the center of Moscow with the appropriate rent,

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
and for this we must provide the appropriate turnover,

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
consulting and the appropriate volume of services provided.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
If we forget about constant costs,

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
if we do not clarify in the planning process,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
and even more precisely, if we do not make an element of the analysis of profitability

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
at the end of the plan,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
and such a line as the determination of the profitable volume of sales

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
and the reserve of financial strength as an assessment of the risk,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
we can get into a bad situation,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
be in losses when our revenue,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
our marginal income,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
the revenue will not cover the costs,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
and even if the revenue covers the costs,

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
then, perhaps, the marginal income will not cover our variable costs.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
Again, I remind you of the two components, profitability and risk.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Very roughly and in a large way,

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
in the planning, of course, in terms of the profit in terms of the lines,

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
when we have a cost, including constant variable costs,

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
we provide variable costs that change proportionally in terms of revenue.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
These variable costs must be justified,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
they must have the appropriate standards,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
and these standards can be introduced according to the accounting.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
The scrupulous planning offers a scrupulous calculation of all the components of variable costs

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
and the standards of variable costs for the specific indicator,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
for the ruble, for the piece, for the ton.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
The universal meter is, of course, the variable costs in the calculation for the ruble of revenue.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Current costs are constant variable,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
this is a fundamental point.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
In addition, there is a very common case

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
when the current costs and capital costs are mixed.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
We are talking about the core moments of profit planning.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Profit is the second part of the balance sheet,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
the second form of accounting,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
it is associated with the current results of activities.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
Only the current costs are reflected in the corresponding costs.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
All capital costs, all uniform costs,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
they affect the positions of the balance sheet.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
What example can be given of a mixture?

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
A new company is created,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
and before the start of the operating processes,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
at the moment of the creation of the enterprise,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
registration of the enterprise,

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
there are expenses that seem to be current expenses,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
the salary of the accountant.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
But in fact, these expenses before the start of the production process

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
cannot be written off for revenue,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
so they are the position of the balance sheet.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Such expenses that seem to be current,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
in fact, are capital,

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
they must be carried out by the corresponding accounting procedures

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
and reflected in the balance sheet as expenses for the future,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
as organizational expenses.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Otherwise, it turns out that there is no revenue,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
there are current expenses,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
which means that losses are formed in the enterprise,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
these losses increase,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
they then go into the balance sheet of the enterprise,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
they exhaust their own capital,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
the net assets of the enterprise are negative,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
and with such a balance sheet,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
you do not have to count on a loan.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I would like to draw your attention to the division of the concepts

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
of the results and expenses,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
inflows and outflows of funds.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Today we have touched on these concepts in one way or another.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And once again,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
we summarize the results and expenses in terms of profit,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
inflows and outflows in cash flows.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
There is no coarser mistake in economic judgments,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
as the academician Novozhilov once said,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
than in the mixture of income and expense,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
with the result and expenses.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
This also happens.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
But we have already given examples many times.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Why does the difference between the concept of profit and cash flow arise?

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Because we have the results of activity,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
for example, revenue,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
which is not always an inflow of funds

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
to the force of the formation of the debtor's debt.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
As part of the expenses,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
we have a wonderful article

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
called amortization calculations,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
which does not mean outflows.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
It is not paid out in the current period.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Amortization calculations accumulate

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
and affect the financial result.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
So, we have considered,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
touched on the basics of planning cash flows,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
liquidity tables, cash flow,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
planned balances,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
profit plans.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
All these tables are interconnected.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
They are made in parallel,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and a separate position goes from one document

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
to another document,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and is corrected.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
For example, we determine the possibility of a loan

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
by the flow of money.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Finances of loans

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
affect the position of the balance.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
In the profit plan,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
after determining the order of financing,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
we correct the cost for interest payments.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
And, in turn,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
calculating the tax on the profit,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
we use a new position,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and transfer this position to the cash flow plan.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Only after making a profit

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
in the cash flow plan

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
we get a table of tax payments.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Here is a simple example.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
This is a professor Zelia,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
my teacher.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
This is a professor of the University of Bremen.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
A simple example of the creation of an enterprise.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
We can see the relationship

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
between finance and accounting.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Let's say,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
in the first year we created an enterprise

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
and invested our own capital.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Here we see the investment of our own capital

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
in the balance.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
We have this money on the account,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
in the assets, in the passives,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
as a fixed capital.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And it is reflected as a flow of funds

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
in terms of liquidity.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
The net cash flow is plus 40.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
In the next year,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
in the next period,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
we buy machines and equipment

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
for the money we have

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
and create a reserve of return funds.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
You can see the change in the balance position

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
and the change in the position of the inflows and outflows.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
In terms of liquidity,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
negative saldo is formed,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
negative net cash flow,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
which means a decrease in the money

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
on the account.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Look, 0 was 40,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
net cash flow minus 40,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
it became 0.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
We have specially stretched it a little

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
for clarity.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Yes, usually these processes are parallel,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
especially when we talk about an operating enterprise.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
It is just more convenient to look at these points

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
to create an enterprise.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And finally, in the third period,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
we start the process of manufacturing goods,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
selling goods,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
and, accordingly,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
the positions of the profit plan appear.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Profit is formed,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
tax is formed,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
inflows and outflows of funds are changed.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I would like to draw your attention to the outflows of funds.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
We reflect the cost of the amortization payments.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In the profit plan,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
we have the total cost of 53 units.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
In the balance,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
we also have new positions,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
the profit tax of this period.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Here, while reflected as a budget calculation,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
the profit tax will be paid in the next period.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
And the next year,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
we continue the production process,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
taxes are paid,

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
revenue from the implementation as an outflow of funds is received.

30:48.000 --> 30:57.000
We pay for our current use of resources.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
And since we planned everything well,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
everything is correct,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
we are constantly increasing the currency balance.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
We are getting richer.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
Thus, we have considered all the processes and documents

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
of long-term financial planning.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
How to make a profit plan,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
how to make a profit plan,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
how to make balances.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
According to these documents,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
the leaders of the upper and middle links

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
can assess

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
how the company will generate a pure money flow,

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
what needs will appear in investments

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
and external financing,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
and when it will appear,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
at what time.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Then we will be able to assess the possibility

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and terms of payment of interest,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
repayment of debt.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
We can monitor the change in the balance value of property

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
according to the predicted balance,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
how the structure of capital will change.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
We will definitely take measures

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
to optimize tax payments,

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
we will plan the payment of dividends.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And in the end,

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
we will predict and calculate the financial state,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
assess profitability and risk of activity

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
in standard indicators.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
We will now consider the specifics

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
of short-term planning.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
It consists of assessing the current needs

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
in financial funds

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
and determining short-term sources of financing.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Please look at the slide.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
From the previous table of financial sources,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
short-term sources,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
external and internal sources,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
are highlighted.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
External sources of financing

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
are loans and loans,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
and debt to suppliers and contractors,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
credit debt.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
Internal sources are debt on taxes and fees,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
and loans on fees,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
invoices, and interest.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Short-term sources of financing

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
are also overdrafts,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
commodity loans.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
The definition of the current needs

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
in short-term financial funds

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
is carried out

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
using a special table of money flows

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
called the cash flow plan.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
We emphasize that this is a short-term plan.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It is a short-term plan

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
that is not a cash flow plan,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
but a short-term plan.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Please look at the slide.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
The main contents of the cash flow plan

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
are presented.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
The cash flow plan includes

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
sales receipts,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
operating payments,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
payment of supplies,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
and all this

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
is short-term.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Now let's look at

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
the routine planning processes

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
of the business.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Again,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
we have a simplified example.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
We have the accounting data

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
for December.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
The next slide, please.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
We have a sales receipts forecast

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
for January, February, and March.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
We can see

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
what is planned for us.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The revenue from the implementation

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
is planned to be sold

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
at 250, 200,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and 250 units per month.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
at 250, 200, and 250 units per month.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Moreover,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
we let go of the vast majority

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
of goods on credit.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
We receive only a small amount of goods,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
10%,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
at the moment.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
at the moment.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You can see

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
how we have the

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
revenue plan ratio,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
the revenue plan ratio,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
the implementation plan,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and the sales receipts plan.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
The December implementation

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
in the amount of

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
350 cash units

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
is due in January.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And only 25 units,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
10% of 250,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
we receive

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in this period.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Next,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
we have to plan

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
the sales receipts plan

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
in accordance with the planned

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
sales receipts.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
The sales receipts are calculated

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
for our revenue,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
for our sales volume

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
in the amount of

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
80, 100, and 140 cash units.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
All sales receipts

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
are implemented

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
with a payment period

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
of a month.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
We pay for the sales receipts

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
in December in January,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
in January in February,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
in February in March.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
These inconsistencies

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
in the payment and

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the payment and the payment

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
receipts, we have planned

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
in the long-term plan

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
within the framework of the

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
turnover capital calculation,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
very largely.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Here, when we make

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the cash receipts,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
we plan in this way.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You can see the final cash receipts plan

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
on this slide.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Here, the balance of cash

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
receipts,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
receipts and payments,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and the balance of receipts

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and payments increases

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
the balance of cash receipts

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
at the end of the period.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
We planned more or less successfully here,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
we have no problems.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
But if the cash receipts plan shows

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
a deficit of cash,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
then it is necessary to provide

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
short-term financing.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
This is due to additional

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
interest payments.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
As an alternative,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
you can use the cash receipts plan

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
to put things in order

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
and provide some transfers

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
between receipts and payments.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
The cash receipts plan allows

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
to predict the moment

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
when we will have a short-term

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
financing and choose the optimal

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
way to meet this need.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And if we have

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
super-normal cash receipts,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
we must

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
within the framework of

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
management and optimization of

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
these receipts, put the free

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and super-normal

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
receipts into liquid value

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
securities.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
But since we work in a very

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
uncertain structure,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
when we can always make some

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
changes,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
we have a special function

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
of planning,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
a sign of planning,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
adaptability of planning.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
We must flexibly

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
anticipate all these changes.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
When we have planned

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
some parameters,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
indicators,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
we must always keep in mind

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
that there will be a need

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
to review them.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Flexibility of planning,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
adaptability of planning

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and the possibility of

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
making adjustments.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It is very convenient

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
to use electronic tables

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
for this.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It is cheap, fast

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
to review the entire planning process,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
to put everything in order,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
to review the planned task,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
to see what we have in the end

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and to form an optimal

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
plan that satisfies

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
both the owners and managers.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
A plan

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
that will not

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
cause doubts

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
when creditors need it.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Today we have covered

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
the conceptual basis, essence

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and features of financial planning.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
In the first chapter

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
we have identified the target parameters

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
of planning,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
learned to divide long-term

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and short-term planning,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
strategy and tactics of the company.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
We have considered the processes

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
of forecasting of money flows

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
as a basis for ensuring

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
financial balance.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
This is the subject of the current planning.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
We have considered

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
the main methods of managing

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the company to optimize

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
the tax payments.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
We have considered

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
the methods of forecasting

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
the needs in investments,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
the sources of financing.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
We remember the rules

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
of financing,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
we remember the risk that lies

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
behind making every decision

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
about investments and financing.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Then we have touched

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
on short-term planning.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
We have considered the technique

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
of cash flow planning,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
the necessary technique,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
the useful one,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
which we can use every day.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Thus, we have highlighted

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and, in general,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
we have implemented

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
the problem of financial planning

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
as a necessity of the current

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and operational monitoring of plans

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
to optimize the financial cycle.
