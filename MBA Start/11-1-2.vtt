WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the project?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
We are moving to the fourth part of our video training,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
the event as a project.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
First, we will talk about the project characteristics of the event.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
What brings the event closer to the project?

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
First, the event has a goal, measurable results,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
there is a time limit, the beginning and the end of the event,

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
and there is a limited amount of resources that are spent for the production of the event,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
resources not only for the monetary, but also for the human and other.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
The event is separated from other ideas,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
we can describe the event as a separate case,

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
although it is undoubtedly connected with the general communication strategy of the company,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
with other promotions, with direct advertising, and so on.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Nevertheless, we can highlight it, and therefore it is a project with its own framework.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
There is an org structure that is created for the project.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
This is either a project group within the company,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
but usually it is a more complex social hierarchy

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
that includes representatives of the company

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
and contractors who are involved in the implementation of the event.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Contractors, in turn, have their own org structure,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
for example, the structure within the event company,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
some subcontractors with whom they work, and so on.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
That is, we are talking about some kind of scheme of interaction of various project participants.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
We move on to determining the goal.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
This is one of the systematic features of the project.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
The project should always have a goal,

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
unlike basic activity, which is constantly repeated in some familiar examples.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
In order for the goal of the event to be formulated correctly,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
it must meet several requirements.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
First, it must be specific enough, not blurry.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Secondly, the goal must be measurable.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Since the goal sets the expected results of the event,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
then the measurement is necessary,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
otherwise we will not be able to indicate what informational and other effect the event had.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Thirdly, the goal must be achievable.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
No need to formulate some too big, too global goal.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Such a goal can be formulated in the mission of the company,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
because the mission should inspire.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
As for the development task and the goal of a particular event,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
it should be quite specific and local.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And there are time restrictions,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
because the event has a beginning and an end,

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
and we cannot implement too many tasks in these narrow time frames.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
What are the possible goals that could be formulated?

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
On the one hand, it can be an increase in brand awareness.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
This can be calculated by sociological surveys.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
On the other hand, it is publicity,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
getting free publications in mass media,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
increasing sales, in this case, revenue and profit are considered,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
sales can be considered both at the event and outside it.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Here you need to establish a correlation between the marketing event and sales outside.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Expanding contacts can be another goal.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
In this case, I mean contacts,

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
primarily with those who are interested in using your services or goods.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Training and team building can be the goal of a special event,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
if it is a corporate event.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
But in the case of communicating with the consumer,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
with the brand and holding free training seminars,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
for example, there is an experience of holding seminars on training housewives using microwaves.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
In this case, training and the ability of the participant of the educational seminar

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
to use this technique, this product, is also one of the results.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
The emotional reaction of the participants can also be recorded and measured.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
This is also one of the possible goals.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Task 10.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Assess the following formulation of the goal of the event according to the above criteria.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
1. Increase the loyalty of employees to the company.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
2. Increase labor productivity.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
3. Create a positive emotional microclimate in the team.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Assess this statement according to the above criteria.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
The recommended time for completing the task is 7-10 minutes.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Let's check the results.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
First, looking at this text, we understand that the goal is not quite specific.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
What does loyalty mean?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
How is it measured in this case?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Labor productivity, how is it measured?

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
The goal can be measured, but quite weakly,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
because it is very difficult to measure loyalty.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You can measure labor productivity,

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
but it is difficult to establish a correlation between the event and the achieved production effect.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
You can create a positive microclimate in the team,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
but the time factor is not taken into account,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
because one event is not enough to create a positive microclimate.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Even if this is done in the short term,

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
it is not a fact that the achieved effect can be fixed in the future.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
In this regard, the event is not self-sufficient.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
I would like to give a good example from the book by the German author,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Halsbauer, which has four other authors.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I will mention this book a little later.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
The event was a tour sponsored by the beer brand Becks.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
The goals were as follows.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
To provide a positive experience for the audience.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
We are talking about a concert, open air, open sky,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
beer that is distributed in some branded devices,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
poured into branded glasses,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
promotional products are distributed,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
which are kept by the participants of the event.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Selling beer in a can at concerts.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
This is another goal that can be measured by sales.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Spreading advertising gifts.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Support through direct advertising and through promotions in places of sale.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
The ability to implement integrated marketing communications.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
This is a good way to formulate goals.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
To make it easier for you to formulate a goal,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I would like to make an addition.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
This is a recommendation that I heard from my colleague,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
the consultant Vladislav Tarasenko.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
He uses this triad of want, can, will.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
When we define the goal of the event,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
we must first determine what we want.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It is clear that our needs are limitless,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
and we want a lot.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Then we move on to the I can stage

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and determine what resources we have.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Then it turns out that not everything we would like

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
we can actually implement.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Then we limit the initial goal.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Then we move on to the I will stage.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
This is what you really intend to do right now.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
This is the activity that you would like to implement

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and are able to implement.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Then the goal is usually a little more limited.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Because no matter how beautiful the project is,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
there is not always an organizational potential of the company

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
to implement it.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Task 11.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Formulate the goal of a hypothetical corporate event

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
using the above criteria for determining the goal.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
We move on to the part called the contractor search.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
The fact is that, as a rule,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
marketers, and within our course we are talking about marketing tasks,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
do not engage in special events

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
and delegate it to professional event managers.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
We have already said that there is a difference

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
between event management and event marketing.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And here the question arises about the search of a contractor

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
who could really implement successful events of a certain type.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
In order to correctly choose a contractor,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
you need to know at what stage of development

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
the Russian event industry is located.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
A little bit about the history of the Russian event business.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
At the turn of the 80s and 90s,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
in fact, there were no event companies in Russia.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
There were individual activists in production,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
directors and production designers,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
freelance artists who had skills and experience

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
in organizing special events.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But of course, at that time,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
the organizer was rather a calling.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Many were not yet trained even in management.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Therefore, there was no need to talk about the profession of event manager,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
especially about event companies.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Then the 90s passed under the banner of holiday companies.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
They were usually called like that.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And at the turn of the 90s and 2000s,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
this industry underwent drastic changes.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
The fact is that at that time,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
there were already quite a lot of

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
qualified and professional marketers,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
professional PR specialists,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
and these people wanted the events

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
that the company held to be tied to their business tasks.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And at that moment, on the one hand,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
new companies began to appear,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
which called themselves event companies.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
On the other hand, already existing holiday agencies

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
began to rename themselves.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
As a rule, the name remained the same,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
but the introduction changed.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
For example, the company began to name itself

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
as a company called the Russian Event Company.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
For example, the company began to be called

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
not a holiday agency, but an event agency,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
or an event company,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
or an event marketing agency,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
or an event marketing agency,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
or a special events agency, and so on.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
But, of course, the transformation of holiday companies

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
into event companies was quite difficult,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and this process is still ongoing.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And the renaming of the company often served

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
as a disguise of the old holiday agency

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
for the new samples that were required

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
in the new Russian business environment.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
But along with this, there was another tendency.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
First, event agencies were opened,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
which were headed by people who were experts in marketing.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And secondly, there was a specialization of event companies

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
for some tasks.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
This is how giant companies were formed,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
which grew out of holiday agencies,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
and small companies that specialize

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
in various areas of event business.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
On the slide, you can see the main types of event companies,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
which we will list.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
These are holiday agencies,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
they still exist,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
but in terms of the tasks and goals

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
that we consider within our course,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
they are less interesting.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Full-cycle companies.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
This is a rather interesting variety of companies.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
On the one hand, they have an organizational basis

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
to implement large-scale events.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
On the other hand, event agencies of the full cycle

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
are those companies that smaller companies delegate their tasks to.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
For example, not all companies have a technical department,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
their own sound equipment,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
their own screenwriters, designers, and so on.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Full-cycle companies have these work resources.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
But unfortunately, according to my observations,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
most event companies of the full cycle

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
are professional organizers.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Therefore, in order to maximize their effectiveness,

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
it is best if they work in a team,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
for example, with a PR agency

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
or with your marketing department,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
which develops the concepts

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
that match the events of the brands.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
On the other hand, there are PR agencies.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Most of them offer special events

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
and use the words event marketing,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
special events, and so on in their presentation materials.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Unfortunately, PR companies,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
when they enter the PR segment,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and sometimes even in the corporate events sector,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
can only organize press events well.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Therefore, we should focus on

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
the fact that we should entrust the press event to PR agencies,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
but not entrust them with other types of events

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
that they cannot organize effectively.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And this will be in any case subcontract.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Along with this,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
there are advertising agencies of the full cycle

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
in the industry of special events.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Advertising agencies can be said to be

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
that, of course, there are cases when such large agencies

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
organized, for example, events on team building,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
but of course this is not their profile.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Sometimes they organize press events,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
because sometimes these agencies have PR departments,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
good PR people who can do it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And, as a rule, advertising agencies of the full cycle

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
in the event component can do

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
product presentations and BTL promotions.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
BTL agencies.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I have already said that this industry thinks of itself

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
in such an expansion of tasks,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
but in principle, BTL agencies are mainly

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
presentations, sampling, and they can be entrusted with this.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Exhibition companies.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
They organize exhibitions or provide services

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
that allow to increase the effectiveness of this part.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
For example, they are engaged in the design of stands,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
provide some post materials, and so on.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Undoubtedly, these companies need to be provided with services

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
if you want to organize a professional exhibition.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Training and team building.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
This is another industry that is somehow

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
associated with event business.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Unfortunately, these agencies are not always

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
conscientious.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Of course, there are specialized event companies

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
that are engaged in team building,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
and they can be entrusted with corporate events,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
because, as a rule, they have this experience.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
But those companies that are positioned as training

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and as additional services offer

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
the organization of corporate events,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
are, as a rule, companies that do not have

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
much organizational experience.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Just doing, say, psychotraining,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
they had experience in organizing

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
team building events.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
This is not the same as, say,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
a large corporate event for 100 or more people.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Pay attention to the possibility of specialization

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
of various event companies.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's repeat once again.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
These are holiday companies.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
These are only holidays.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
The agencies of the full cycle can organize

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
mass events.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They have a production base for this.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
PR agencies.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It is better to concentrate on

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
holding a press conference and presentations

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
in cooperation with them.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Advertising agencies of the full cycle

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
can hold promo and presentations well,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and sometimes press events,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
if there is a good PR department.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
BTL agencies are, in fact,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
a classic BTL and exhibition work.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Exhibition companies can organize

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
only exhibitions.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Companies that are engaged in training

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
and team building can organize

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
trainings, intensives,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
sometimes including going abroad,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
hold team building events

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and corporate holidays.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Task 12.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Find a correspondence between

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
the tasks of the event

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and the type of event agency.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Who can be entrusted with the event,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
what type of event.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Check the results.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So, we had two columns

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and we had to find a correspondence.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
A holiday agency can successfully

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
hold a festival,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
but it is better to work in tandem

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
with a PR agency.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
A holiday agency can organize

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
a New Year's corporate party,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
especially if the task is

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
mostly holiday and relaxing.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And that's it.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
An event agency of the full cycle

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
can organize a festival very well,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
because it is usually a mass event.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And in some cases,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
you can entrust the event agency

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
of the full cycle with a New Year's corporate party,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
especially if the business task

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
is not being implemented,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
but the task is purely organizational.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
A PR agency can hold a press conference

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
and in some cases

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
a presentation of products

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
for a small number of participants.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
A BTL agency can hold

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
a presentation of products

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and that's it from this list.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
But there are agencies that have

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
a lot of experience in organizing festivals,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and you can entrust them with this.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
A company that specializes

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
in training and team building

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
can hold a New Year's corporate party

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
in some cases,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
if it is not a purely training company,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
but an event company

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
specializing in team building.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Usually, they have some experience,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
some projects related to New Year's

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and other corporate events.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
When looking for a contractor,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
you need to have a good understanding

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
of the quality and composition of the projects.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Usually, this is stated on the company's website.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
In this case, it is better

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
not to pay attention

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
to the client lists.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I did a monitoring of the client lists

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
of leading Moscow event companies

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
and found that they often

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
coincide

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
with a large percentage.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What is it connected with?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
First, the client lists

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
are often very small.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
They are often not very large.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Therefore,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
positioning of the event companies

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
often does not have a unique offer

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
that makes the client stay.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That is why contractors are often changed.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
On the other hand,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
there can be former clients

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
in the client list.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
In this regard,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
cooperation with a well-known company

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
can be very important.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The client lists

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
are often very small.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
The client lists

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
can be very important.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
However,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
cooperation with a well-known company

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
is not an advantage

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
if it ends with a conflict

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
and the client leaves.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Finally, some large companies

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
or holding companies

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
simply divide their tasks

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
on organizing special events

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
into several parts.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Regardless of the specialization,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
they give it to different event agencies.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The second thing

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
you should pay attention to

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
when looking for a contractor

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
is the first contact.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
If you applied to an event agency

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and sent them a brief

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
or a formulated tender

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
to hold an event

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and they contact you in a week or more,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
it means that

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
the contractor does not need you.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Most likely, it is a large agency

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
with a certain flow.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Maybe it is better

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
to make a smaller event agency

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
that will be interested in your project.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It should have experience

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
in implementing such projects.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
The third thing you should pay attention to

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
is the system of brief questions.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
This question is often

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
mentioned during the first negotiations.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
If the contractor's company

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
is only interested in

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
the budget of the event,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
your first talks,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
the first meetings,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
the first meetings

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
with the client,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
your common wishes,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and the conversation ends

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
with the fact that

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
it makes no sense to cooperate

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
with the company.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
The event business professionals

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
should be interested in the goal

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
of the marketing event,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
the goal of the HR event,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and so on.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
In the extreme case,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
if we are talking about professional organizers

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
who are not familiar with other business technologies,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
the contractors' representatives

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
should be interested

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
in the logistics of the event,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
the scale of the audience,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
the venue of the event,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
that is, what concerns the organization.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If there are no questions in the brief,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
if the brief is very short

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and just suggests the type

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and budget of the event,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it means that you decide

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
who you will give a gift to

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
in the form of this budget,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
and not solve your own business tasks.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And, oddly enough,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
you should pay attention

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
to the feedback of your managers,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
but not just good feedback

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
that should interest you,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
but feedback that is related

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
to the implementation of successful projects

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
for the type of event

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
that you are looking for.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Why announce a tender?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The question is quite naive,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
but at the same time

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
it is ambiguous.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
On the one hand,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
the company is a driver of progress.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
If the company starts fighting

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
for your order,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
at the start of the relationship

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
they perceive it differently

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
if the order is received.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
If the order was received

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
without much effort,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
then the possible attitude

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
to you will be like this.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Professional negotiators recommend

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
to say no first,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
to create some kind of obstacle

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
during the discussion,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
to compromise,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
so that the cooperation takes place.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In the case of an announcement of a tender,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
this rule also works.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
The second important point

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
that makes us announce a tender

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
is that the companies,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
participating in it,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
offer a large number

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
of concepts of special events,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and you can consider

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
more creative ideas.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
But here I must warn you

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
that many companies,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
when they offer an interesting creative idea,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
take it and leave it

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
to another contractor.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
There are blacklists

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
among the agencies,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
which are regularly replenished.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
There are ways

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
of cooperation

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
of event business representatives,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
and therefore it is probably not worth

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
to strike

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
your reputation with such machinations.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Therefore, if the company

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
offered a creative idea

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and you want to implement it,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
you need to implement it with the same company

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
in order not to risk your reputation.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
There are disadvantages

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
associated with the announcement of a tender.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
On the one hand,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
it is very difficult to organize

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
an honest competition.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
In the early 2000s,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
event business representatives,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
leaders of this field,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
generally said that a tender

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
should not be organized.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
This was the position of large event companies,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
that if we are market leaders,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
let them contact us.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
This was an attempt to compete

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
with competitors in the face of smaller companies,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
which segmented

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
target audiences

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
of large event companies,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
creating additional

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
specialization options.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Therefore, large companies

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
sought to save their clients in this way.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Now the situation is a little different,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
because the tender

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and the announcement of the tender

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
are not created as a fact of business reality.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Therefore,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
the same event companies

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
have reconsidered their position.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Today, they often

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
at special events,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
events in the industry,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
at various conferences,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
seminars, talk about the need

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
to develop rules that allow

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
fair tenders.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Of course, you know that there is a problem

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
of rollbacks, which is associated

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
with the search for contractors.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
But, in general,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
the presence or absence of rollbacks

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
when the project is transferred to the contractor

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
depends on the corporate culture

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
of the company,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
and whether the top management

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
allows the employees to behave in this way.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Another drawback of the tender

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
is that it includes

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
companies that are not

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
suitable for the client.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
This may be a drawback,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
or it may not be, because

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
in the case of an open tender,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
the company's managers spend a lot of time

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
to analyze

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
the submitted

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
proposals,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
including those of companies that are not interested.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
On the other hand,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
the tender can be announced

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
between the companies

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
to which the request was sent,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and in this regard not to be absolutely open.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Perhaps, this is a compromise

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
between

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
giving the order

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
to the company that has already been recommended

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
and announcing the tender.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
There are resources

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
for announcing a tender.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Some of them are networked,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
some are not.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
For example, the Event.ru magazine

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
is actually an offline

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
print publication

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
and is distributed by subscription.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
But the magazine has a one-name website,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and the head of this magazine,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
his editor,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Andrey Shishenin,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
has been supporting

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
fair tenders

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and trying to formulate

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
some conventional rules

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
within the event industry

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
that allow fair participation in the tender.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And, perhaps,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
this company can be addressed

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
by looking for potential contractors.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
On the other hand,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
there is the eventmarket.ru portal.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
This is the oldest portal

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
in our industry,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
which has an option

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
to announce a tender.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
This also allows

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
to draw conclusions

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
about the effectiveness of this tool

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
at the moment.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
There is the eventforum.ru resource,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and its founders

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
can also be contacted

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
to announce a tender.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And finally, there is the eventmarket.ru community.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Despite the name coincidence,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
it is not controlled

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
by the people

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
who founded the eventmarket.ru portal.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But this is also an interesting resource

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
that allows to attract

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
the attention of the eventers.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
What I have to warn you about

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
is that all the resources

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
that are aimed

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
at creating

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
informational materials

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
or coordinating

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
the interaction

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
within the event industry

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
are, one way or another,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
controlled by some event company.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
In this regard,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
if you turn to some resource,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
it positions itself as independent,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
but announces a tender through it,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
and the resource is affiliated

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
with a large event agency,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
you will accidentally get into its hands.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
In fact, it is easier to find out

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
who is affiliated with a particular site,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
a particular community,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and directly contact

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
its founders.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
On the other hand,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
there are some impediments here.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I think that,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
despite the fact that event.ru

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
is considered to be a fully independent publication,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
it is a journal

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
to which founders can

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
apply for a tender

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
and get a more or less adequate

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
independent result.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Next, we move on

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
to another aspect of the event

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
as a project activity,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
that is, to measure the results

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
of a special event.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It should be said that the results

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
of its measurement depend on the goal set.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
We have discussed what goals

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
are adequate for a particular event,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and now we have to name

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
how the results of the event

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
correspond to the goals

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
set.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
For example,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
the brand's awareness

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
can be measured

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
by conducting

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
some sociological surveys,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
by applying for statistics.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Free publications

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
can be measured

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
both quantitatively and qualitatively.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
The quantitative factor

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
is interesting

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
in terms of the information effect of the event,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
but the qualitative analysis

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
is necessary to determine

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
the context of the brand's mention,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
how detailed

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
the story about the brand

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
was in a particular article,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
in a particular material.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
In general, whether the material

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
or just the information partners

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
in your industry published the event

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
pre-release without changing it,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
all this can be analyzed.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
In addition,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
publicity can be determined

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
not only by the media

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and television,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
but also by the blogosphere.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
The blog's mention,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
the context of the mention,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
the presence or absence

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
of photo and video materials

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
can also be a tasteful paper

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
of the effectiveness of the event.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Another criterion

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
of assessment is the sale.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
If you sold your product

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
during the event,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
it can be about

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
the calculation of revenue.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
In this case, it is purely monetary.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Another criterion is

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
the expansion of the number of contacts

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
obtained as a result of the event.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I will give an example.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
A representative of your company

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
took part in the conference

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
of a large exhibition.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
He received a certain number of business cards.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
We can calculate

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
how many business cards

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and contacts were there.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
We can deduce

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
the number of clients

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
who can really

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
interact with your company

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and allow them to

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
use your services

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
or purchase your products.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
We can also calculate

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
the total number

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
of contacts

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
which turned into real orders

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
or real purchases.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
There is a certain

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
complexity here.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
A speaker can

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
work very well

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
and get a large number

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
of new contacts.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
However, during the further

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
work of the managers

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
on the development

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
after the event,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
the work can be done

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
incorrectly,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
the relationship with the potential client

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
can be wrong,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and the initial

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
positive effect

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
can have no effect

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
on the real sales.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
The next direction

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
of measuring the results of the event

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
can be training and team building.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
In the case of training,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
we can measure

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
the skills and knowledge obtained.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
In the case of team building,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
we measure

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
the new role positions

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
in the team,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
the strength of the team,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
the strategy of leadership

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
of certain employees,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
and so on.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
We can also measure

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
the emotional reaction of the participants.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It can be measured as a post-factum

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
by analyzing the feedback

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
about the event

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
and by observing

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the participants during the event.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
This is also a very interesting

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
material for analysis.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
As a conclusion,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
let's look at what we learned

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
and what we learned

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
during our video training.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
We learned what event marketing is,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
what is the technology

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
of promotion of the brand,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
what are the ways to create

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
creative concepts of events.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
We learned what determines the success

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
of certain types of events,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
how to find the right contractors

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
and how to determine the degree of effectiveness

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
of the event.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We learned how to create creative concepts

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
of events using different creative technologies,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
how to coordinate a creative concept

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
with the brand platform,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
how to determine the types and ways

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
of participating in events of different types,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
how to formulate the optimal goals of the event,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
how to find criteria for measuring

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
the effectiveness of events.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
In conclusion, I would like to recommend

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
a book that can expand your understanding

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
of event marketing technologies.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
This is my book

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
«Events Marketing. Leadership for Customers and Performers».

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The book was published in 2006

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
and now my new work is being prepared

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
«101 Cases on Event Marketing.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Russian Experience».

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
The book is written by my colleague

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Alexander Shumovich

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
«Great Events. Technologies and Practices

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
of Event Management».

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
It is also beautifully written

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
and it can be interesting

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
for your organization.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
We talked about marketing tasks of events

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
and Alexander specializes

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
in organizational tasks.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
There is also a wonderful book

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
by German authors

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Halsbauer and his four co-authors

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
«Event Management»

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
published in 2007

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
by Exmo.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
This book is really monumental.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It was not written by accident

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
by such a large team.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
You can find useful information

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
about organizational aspects of special events

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
and their marketing components.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
The book by Alexander Pasmurov

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
«How to effectively prepare

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
and hold a conference, seminar, exhibition»

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
can also be useful for you.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
The author does not write about all events

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
but mainly about

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
«business events»

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
and has a significant experience

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
in organizing special events

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
of the business sector.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
The book contains

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
a lot of recommendations

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
about organizational plan

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and recommendations

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
about communication

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
of special events.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I also recommend

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
to read the book

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
by Bernd Schmidt

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
and his co-authors

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
«Business TV Show. Marketing in culture of impressions».

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
He is one of the authors

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
who promotes

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
the concept of «entertainment marketing».

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
A little earlier he used

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
the term «empirical marketing».

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
The book contains

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
several detailed cases

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
of event marketing

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
and motivates those

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
who want to

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
set their mind on the creative wave

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
and create really interesting

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
and surprising events.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Among the Internet sources

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I recommend the website of the off-line publication

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
«Event.ru».

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It will give you a hint

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
how to subscribe to this publication

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
and the oldest branch portal

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
«Eventmarket.ru»

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
which is constantly updated

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
and contains a lot of useful information

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
for those who are interested

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
in the industry of special events.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Our video training has come to an end.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Good luck!
