WEBVTT

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.740
We move on to the fourth part of our

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.020
video training “Events as a Project”

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.700
and we will start by talking about the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.100
project characteristics of the event.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.800
What brings the events closer to the project?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
First, the event has a goal measurable

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.960
results, there is a limitation

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.360
in the time of the beginning and

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.120
end of the event and there

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.840
is a limitation of resources

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.300
that are spent to produce

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.960
events, resources not only

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.340
monetary, but, say,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.760
human and other.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860
The event is separate from other plans.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.540
We can describe an event as a separate

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.500
case, although it is undoubtedly

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
related to the company’s

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.140
overall communication strategy,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.220
other promotions, direct

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.640
advertising, and so on.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.040
But, nevertheless, and therefore, it is

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.240
a project that has its framework.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.360
There is an organization that is created

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.460
under the project.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.260
It is either a project group within

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.420
the company, but it is usually a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.320
more complex social hierarchy that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.640
includes representatives of the company

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.980
and contractors who are,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.560
one way or another, involved

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.540
in the implementation of the event.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.380
And contractors, in turn, have their

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.660
own organizational structure, for example,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.880
the structure within the company,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.320
some subcontractors with whom

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.580
they work, and so on.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.620
This is a type of interaction

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.600
between the various participants

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.780
of the project.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.900
We move on to the definition of the goal.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.980
This is one of the systemic features

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.040
of the project.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.860
A project should always have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.160
a goal, unlike a basic activity

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.500
that is repeated at

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.480
some point.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.140
If the purpose of the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.060
event was formulated correctly,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.440
it must meet several requirements.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.760
First, it should be quite

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.940
specific, unflattering.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.300
Second, the goal must be measurable.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.900
Since the goal sets the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.240
expected outcomes of the event, measurement

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.320
is necessary, otherwise we cannot

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.060
indicate what information

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.100
and other effect the Third

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.560
Party has, the goal must be

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.120
achievable.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.420
It is not necessary to formulate

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.760
a too large, too global goal.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.100
Such a goal can be formulated

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.800
in the company’s mission, because

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.680
the mission should inspire.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.600
As for the development goals and the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.940
purpose of the specific event,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.560
it should be quite specific and local.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.080
And there is a time

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.300
limit because an event

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.720
can push too many tasks

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.140
into the current

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.620
time frame.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.040
What are the possible goals

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.700
that could be formulated?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.320
On the one hand, it can be an increase

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.480
in brand recognition, this can be

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.700
calculated by means of

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.300
sociological surveys.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.620
On the other hand, it is publicity,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.900
receiving free publications in the mass

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.260
media, increasing sales, in this

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.680
case, both revenue and profit are considered.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.240


00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.440
Sales can be counted both at the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.960
event itself and outside it, but here

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.300
you need to establish a correlation

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.480
between the marketing event and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.360
sales outside.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.740
Expanding contacts

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.520
may be another goal.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.200
In this case, you mean contacting

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.720
first and foremost those who are

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.440
interested in consuming your services

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.500
or goods.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.380
Training and education team can

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.880
be the goal of a special event,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.020
if it is a corporate event,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.700
but in the situation of involvement

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.720
of the consumer to the brand and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.380
conducting free training seminars,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.100
for example, there is experience

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.020
of conducting seminars on training

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.560
households to use microwaves,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.980
in this case training and the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.680
ability of the participant of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.060
the educational seminar

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.320
to use this technique, this

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.980
product, is also one of the results.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.620
The emotional reaction of participants

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.720
can also be recorded and measured,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.360
which is also one of the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.440
possible goals.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.600
The task 10.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.640
Assess the following formulation of

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.460
the purpose of the event according to the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.560
above criteria.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.460
Increase the loyalty of employees,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.360
increase the productivity

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.440
of work, create a positive

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.000
emotional microclimate

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.880
in the team.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.600
Assess this statement according

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.200
to the above criteria.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.700
Recommended time for

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.280
the task is 7-10 minutes.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.140
Check the results.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.220
First, looking at this text, we understand

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.920
that the goal is not quite specific.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.540
What is loyalty, how it is

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.060
measured in this case,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.940
productivity, how it is measured,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.200
and so on.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.200
The goal can be measurable, but

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320
it is rather weak because it is very

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.680
difficult to measure loyalty.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.040
Productivity can be measured, but it

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.840
is difficult to establish a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.220
correlation between the event

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.600
and the achieved production effect.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.140
You can create a positive microclimate

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.580
in the team, but the time factor is

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.120
not taken into account here, because

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.640
one event to create a positive

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.740
microclimate is not enough.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.540
Even if this was possible in some

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.440
short term, it is not a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.740
fact that it will be possible to consolidate

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.120
the achieved effect in the future.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.340
In this respect, the event is not self-sufficient.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.040
I would like to give a good example from

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.980
the book of the German author Halzbaur.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.920
He has four co-authors.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.060
I will mention this book later.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.940
The event was held, a tour sponsored

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.260
by the beer brand Becks.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.780
In this case, the following

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.160
objectives were set.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.940
Positive experiences for the audience.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.580
It is about a concert, open air,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.080
open sky, beer, which is carried

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.220
out in some branded appliances,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.660
poured into branded glasses,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.000
promotional products are

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.060
distributed, which

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.040
remains in the participants

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.760
of the event for memory.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.060
Selling beer at concerts.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.820
This is another goal that can be

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.100
measured by selling.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.800
Distribution of advertising gifts.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.040
Support through direct advertising and through

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.620
promotions at the sales venues.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.620
The possibility of implementing

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.700
integrated marketing communications.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.440
This is a good form of purpose.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.520
In order to make it easier for you

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.700
to formulate the goal, I would like

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.800
to add an addition.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.600
This is the recommendation I

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.120
heard from my colleague, from

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.900
the consultant Vladislav Trochenko.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.840
He uses this triad “I want, I can,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.880
I will.”

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.420
When we define the purpose

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.740
of an event, we must first

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.200
define what we principally want.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.120
Our needs are limitless

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.860
and we want a lot.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.300
Next we move to the stage of “we can” and

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.700
determine what we have resources.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.600
And then it turns out that not

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.480
everything we would like to do

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.700
can be realised.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.280
Then we limit the

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.640
original goal.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.960
Then we move to the “I will”.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.300
This is what you really

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.880
intend to do right now.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.780
This is an activity that

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.360
you really want to implement

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.400
and are able to implement.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.660
And then the goal is usually a

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.960
little more limited, because, no

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.220
matter how beautiful the project

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.060
is, there is not always the

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.640
organizational potential of the

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.180
company to implement it.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.700
The task 11.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.140
Formulate the goal of a hypothetical

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.160
corporate event using the above-

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.740
mentioned criteria for determining

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.000
the goal.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.730
We move to the part called

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.750
“search for a contractor”.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.330
The fact is that, as a rule, marketers,

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.590
and within our course we are

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.130
talking about marketing tasks,

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.690
do not engage in the

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.970
organization of special

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.870
events and delegate this to

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.230
a professional event manager.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.370
We have already said that there are

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.550
differences between ivent management and ivent marketing.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.550
And here the question arises

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.070
of finding a contractor

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.530
who could really implement successful

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.770
events of a certain type.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.050
In order to choose the right contractor,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.290
you need to know what stage of development

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.730
the Russian appliance

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.470
industry is at.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.210
A little history of Russian business.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.250
At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, in

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.290
fact, there were no event companies in Russia.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.150
There were individual activists

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.970
at the production,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.610
directors-performers, freelance

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.630
artists who had the skills

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.890
and experience to organize

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.170
special events.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.870
But, of course, at that time,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.110
the organizer was more of a calling.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.190
Many of them were not even

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.070
trained.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.050
And so talking about the profession of

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.630
the ivent manager, especially about

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.130
the ivent companies, was not necessary.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.870
Then the 90s went under the sign

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.370
of holiday companies, they

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.850
were called as usual.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.550
And at the turn of the 1990s-2000s

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.970
this industry underwent sharp changes.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.670
The fact is that in the Russian

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.790
business environment at the time

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.970
there were already

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.970
a lot of certified and professional

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.190
marketers, professional PR

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.070
specialists, professional personnel

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.310
management specialists.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.270
And these people wanted the events that

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.370
the companies are implementing to be

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.370
tied to their business goals.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.390
And at this point, on the one

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.010
hand, new companies began to appear,

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.750
which called themselves an ivent company.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.750
On the other hand, the existing holiday

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.170
agencies have begun to rename themselves.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.030
The name is usually the same, but

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.950
the introduction has changed.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.030
For example, the company began

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.250
to be called not a holiday

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.750
agency, but an event agency, or

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.950
an event company, or an event

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.430
marketing agency, or an event

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.410
marketing agency, or a

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.930
special events agency, and

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.510
so on.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.910
But, of course, the transformation

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.190
of holiday companies into

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.210
an ivent company was quite

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.090
difficult.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.310
And so far this process continues.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.550
And the company’s renaming often

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.970
served as a simple masking of the

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.450
old holiday agency under the new

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.970
patterns that were needed

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.190
in the new Russian business

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.410
environment.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.530
But there was another trend

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.250
alongside this.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.390
First, there were event

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.970
agencies that were led by

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.610
people who were leading in marketing.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.050
Second, there was specialization

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.490
of ivent companies on

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.430
some tasks.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.690
Thus, giant companies

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.610
emerged from holiday

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.710
agencies.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.750
And small companies that specialize

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.510
in various areas of the

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.050
ivent business.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.330
On the slide you can see the main types

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.950
of ivent companies listed.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.810
This is a holiday agency,

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.150
they still exist.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.310
But in terms of the tasks and

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.530
goals we consider as part of our

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.610
course, they are less interesting.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.090
company full cycle.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.810
This is a pretty interesting

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.910
type of company.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.870
On the one hand, they have

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.430
the organizational base

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.090
to implement large-scale

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.730
events.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.950
On the other hand, full-cycle

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.390
agencies are just those companies

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.430
to which smaller companies

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.250
delegate their tasks.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.310
For example, not all companies have

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.990
a technical department, their own

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.930
sound equipment, their own

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.590
writers, designers, etc.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.390
Full-cycle companies have this

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.430
orgressource.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.850
But, unfortunately, according

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.690
to my observations, most

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.570
full-cycle event companies

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.770
are professional organizers.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.770
Therefore, in order to maximize

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.190
their effectiveness, it is best

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.250
if they work in pair, in a team,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.630
for example, with a peer agency

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.470
or with your marketing department,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.250
which develops those concepts

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.130
that coordinate the

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
events of the brand.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.870
There is a PIA agency.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.610
Most of them offer the organization

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.710
of special events and

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.350
use in their presentation

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.090
materials the words event

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.050
marketing, event marketing,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.890
special events, etc.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.630


00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.170
Unfortunately, the peer companies,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.030
entering the promo segment, and sometimes

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.130
even in the sector of corporate

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.630
events, can really

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.510
organize only press events.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.090
Therefore, we must emphasize that

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.470
press events should be entrusted

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.810
to public agencies, but not to entrust

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.750
them with other types of events

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.210
that they cannot effectively

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.070
organize.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.850
It will be in any case.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.870
In addition, there are full-

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.410
cycle advertising agencies

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.350
in the special events industry.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.670
About advertising agencies, we

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.450
can say that, of course, there

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.470
are cases when such large

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.730
agencies organized, for

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.850
example, events on the team of education.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.490
But that is not their profile.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.430
Sometimes they organize press

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.690
events because sometimes there are

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.210
public relations departments in

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.830
these agencies, good public relations

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.010
workers who can do so.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.250
And, as a rule, advertising

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.950
agencies of the full cycle

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.430
in the event component can make

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.990
high-quality product presentations

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.270
and btl-actions.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.980
BTL agencies – I have already said that

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.540
this industry thinks of itself in such

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.520
an expansion of tasks, but, in principle,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.980
BTL agencies are basically a presentation,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.880
a sample, and they can be

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.960
entrusted.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.600
Exhibition companies organize exhibitions

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.820
or provide services that

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.780
allow to showcase the effectiveness

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.800
of this part.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.020
For example, they are engaged in

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.380
designing stands, providing some

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.620
post-materials and the like.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.680
Undoubtedly, the services of these companies

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.600
must be resorted to if you want

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.800
to organize a professional exhibition.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.920
Training and team training are

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.820
another industry that is somehow

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.900
related to event business.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.840
Unfortunately, these agencies

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.060
are not always honest.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.140
Of course, there are specialized

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.700
event companies that engage in team-

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.260
building, and they can be entrusted

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.060
with including corporate

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.340
events, because, as a rule,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.840
they have this experience.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.120
But those companies that

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.920
are positioned as training and

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.500
as an additional service offer

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.800
the organization of

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.900
corporate events are, as a rule,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.720
companies that do not have

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.400
much organizational experience,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.360
simply engaged in, say,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.920
psychotrainings, they had experience

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.960
of holding team-

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.780
education events.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.300
It’s not the same, say, with

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.920
a big corporate event on a stand

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.760
of more people.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.340
Pay attention to the specialization

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.560
opportunities of various event companies.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.560
Let us repeat again, holiday

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.980
companies are just holidays.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.280
Full-cycle agencies can

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.260
organize mass events,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.400
whether they have a production

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.580
base.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.760
The peer agencies are better,

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.280
interacting with them,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.160
to concentrate on holding a press

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.980
conference and presentation.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.360
Full-cycle advertising agencies can

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.900
do well with promos and presentations,

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.240
and sometimes press

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.000
events, if there is a good

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.020
peer department.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.660
BTL agencies are, in fact, the

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.340
classic BTL and work on exhibitions.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.320
Exhibition companies can

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.700
only organize exhibitions.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.420
Companies that engage

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.100
in team training can organize

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.540
training, intensives, sometimes

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.560
including with a trip,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.360
say, abroad, hold

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.340
team training events

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.180
and corporate holidays.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.660
The task 12.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.620
Find a match between the tasks

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.140
of the event and the type of event agency.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.540
Who can be trusted for what type

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.360
of event?

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.040
Check the results.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.840
So we had two columns, and

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.480
we needed to find a match.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.480
A holiday agency can successfully

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.040
conduct a festival, but it is better

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.180
that it works in pair, for example,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.620
with a peer agency.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.760
A holiday agency can perfectly

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.200
organize a New Year corporate,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.200
especially if the task is

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.440
mainly holiday and relaxing.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.580
and all.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.200
A full-cycle event agency

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.220
can very well organize a

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.880
festival because it

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.820
is usually a mass event.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.280
And in a number of cases, you can entrust

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.600
an event agency with a full cycle of

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.560
a New Year corporation, especially if

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.280
business tasks are not put forward, and

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.300
the tasks are purely organizational.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.720
The PIA may hold a press conference

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.340
and in some cases a presentation

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.240
of products for a small

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.080
number of participants.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.440
BTL agency will present products in

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.660
a pre-set manner, and from this list,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.500
as a rule, everyone, but there are

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.740
agencies that have experience

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.080
in holding festivals, they can

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.120
be trusted.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.140
A company that specializes in training

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.080
and team training, in a number

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.280
of cases can hold a New Year

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.860
corporate event, if it is not

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.780
a purely training company,

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.520
but an event company specializing

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.400
in team training events.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.520
Usually in the package they

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.360
have some experience, some projects

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.040
that are related to New Year's

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.760
and other corporate events.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.340
When looking for a contractor, you should take

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.540
into account the quality and composition

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.040
of the projects.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.880
This is usually stated on the company’s website.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.780
In this case, it is usually better

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.900
not to pay attention to customer sheets.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.140
I monitored the customer lists

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.220
of the leading Moscow event

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.080
companies and found that they

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.520
very often match a fairly

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.800
large number of percentages.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.380
What does it have to do with?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.640
First, a customer often leaves

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.540
one event company to another.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.300
The specialization in the market

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.840
is not so great, so in the positioning

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.400
of the event company very often

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.900
there is no unique offer that makes

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.940
the customer stay with them.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.660
They often change contractors.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.900
On the other hand, in the customer

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.760
list may be former customers.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.100
In this regard, cooperation with

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.740
a well-known company, with a well-known

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.480
brand is not an advantage if it ended

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.180
in conflict and the departure of

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.080
the customer.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.180
Finally, some large companies,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.060
holding, say, corporate types

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.920
simply divide their tasks on

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.860
organizing special events into

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.880
several parts and, regardless

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.920
of specialization, give

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.920
it to different event agencies.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.200
The second thing to pay attention

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.380
to when looking for a contractor

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.640
is the first contact.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.220
If you contacted an

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.360
event agency, for example,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.980
sent them a briefing

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.760
or a formulated tender for

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.900
an event and you are contacted

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.900
in a week or more, it means that

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.100
the contractor simply doesn’

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.020
t need you.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.880
This agency, which will

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.920
really deal with your project,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.740
is really interested in it,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.100
but at the same time, of course,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.240
this agency should have experience

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.340
in implementing such projects.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.100
The third thing to pay attention

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.680
to is the system of questions in the brief.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.160
This is often the case during

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.220
the first negotiations.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.900
If the contractor's company

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.340
is only interested in, say, the event

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.440
budget, your some general wishes,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.700
and this conversation ends, it

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.180
means that it simply doesn't make

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.760
sense to cooperate with the company,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.400
because event business professionals

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.840
should be interested in what

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.680
the purpose of the event is marketing,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.420
what the purpose of the event

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.900
in terms of human resources

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.500
management, if it is a

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.200
HR event and so on and so on.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.380
In the extreme case, if it is a matter

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.320
of professional organizers, not knowing

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.460
other business technologies,

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.480
the representatives of the contractor

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.960
company should be interested

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.800
in something regarding the logistics

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.060
of the event, the scale of the audience,

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.080
the place of the event,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.000
that is, what concerns

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.100
the organization.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.100
If there are no questions in the briefing of

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.080
this system, if the briefing is very short

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.680
and simply implies indicating the type and

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.540
budget of the event, it means that you decide

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.220
on the question to whom you will make

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.620
a gift in the form of this budget,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.660
rather than solving your own business-

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.840
sized tasks.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.980
Well, strangely enough, you need

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.340
to pay attention to the reviews

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.320
of familiar managers, but not just good

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.560
reviews you should be interested

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.600
in, but reviews that are related

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.320
to the implementation of successful

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.580
projects on the type of events, contractor

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.300
you are looking for.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.500
Why announce a tender?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.240
The question is quite naive, but at

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.360
the same time it is ambiguous.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.800
But on the one hand, competition is the

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.140
engine of progress.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.540
If companies start to fight for your order,

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.940
then at the start of the relationship

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.200
they will perceive it differently

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.840
if the order is received.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.120
If the order was obtained without

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.840
much effort, then the attitude to you

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.660
will be this.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.740
Professional negotiators recommend

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.520
that you first say no, first

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.740
create some obstacle

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.720
in the discussion,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.760
and then agree.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.600
Then the opposite side of the

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.960
negotiations will seek to come

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.780
to some kind of compromise, so

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.460
that cooperation will still take place.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.660
In the case of the tender announcement,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.340
this rule also works.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.060
The second important point

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.060
that makes us announce the

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.180
tender is that companies participating

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.960
in it offer a fairly large

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.660
number of special event

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.100
concepts, and you

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.460
can consider more creative

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.460
ideas.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.400
But here I have to warn you that

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.440
many companies, getting an

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.440
interesting creative idea,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.980
take it and go with it to another

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.400
contractor.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.980
There are black lists among agencies

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.020
that are regularly replenished,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.200
there are ways of cooperating with

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.360
representatives of the event

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.360
business, and therefore,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.020
probably, you should not

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.940
still strike your reputation

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.140
with such tricks.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.380
Therefore, if the company has offered

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.320
a creative idea, and you want to

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.260
implement it, then you need

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.660
to implement it with the same company,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.440
in order not to risk reputation.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.580
There are shortcomings associated

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.040
with the tender announcement.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.760
It is very difficult to organize

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.420
a fair competition.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.740
But in the early 2000s, representatives

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.480
of the event business, the leaders

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.300
of this direction, generally said

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.880
that the tender is not necessary

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.900
to organize.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.420
This was the position of the

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.780
major inventory companies, and they thought

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.160
that why, if we are market leaders,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.040
let them turn to us.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.260
It was an attempt to counter

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.880
the competitors in the face of smaller

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.160
companies, which segmentally cut

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.980
off the target audiences of large inventory

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.160
companies, creating additional

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.040
specialization options.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.940
That is why large companies

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.540
have sought to retain their

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.160
customers.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.300
Now the situation is a little different,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.860
because the tender and tender announcement

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.420
were realized as a fact of the reality

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.300
of business.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.280
And so the same Ivent

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.000
companies have revised their position.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.980
Today, they are very often

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.960
at special events, the

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.720
event industry, at various

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.660
conferences, seminars, talk

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.720
about the need to develop

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.500
rules that allow for fair

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500
tenders.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.300
Naturally, you know that there is a problem

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.160
with the outlets that are associated with

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.600
the search for contractors.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.800
This problem is quite serious.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.980
But, in large part, the presence or

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.320
absence of outlets when transferring

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.700
the project to the contractor depends

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.740
on the company’s corporate culture,

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.660
and whether the company’

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.820
s top management allows

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.680
employees to behave in this way.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.920
Another disadvantage of the

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.700
tender is that it includes

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.440
companies that are obviously not

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.480
suitable for the customer.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.780
This may be a disadvantage,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.000
or may not be, because

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.740
indeed in the situation of an

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.820
open tender the company

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.300
manager spends a lot of time

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.060
analyzing the sent offers, including

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.760
from the company, which

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.880
obviously do not interest

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.740
you as contractors.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.580
On the other hand, the tender can

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.920
be announced between those companies to

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.800
which the request was sent, and in

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.380
this respect it is not absolutely open.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.900
And,, it is some compromise

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.400
between ordering an instantly

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.600
established company and

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.540
announcing a competition.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.340
There are resources for tender announcement.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.300
Some are networked, some

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.140
are not.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.120
So, say, Event True is actually

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.220
an offline, printed edition,

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.400
and is distributed

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.080
on a subscription.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.160
The magazine has a website of the

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.640
same name, and the managers of

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.000
the magazine, its editor Andrei

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.540
Shishenin, have long been supporting

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.560
fair tenders and trying to

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.020
formulate some conventional

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.680
rules within the Event Industry

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.580
that allow fair participation

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.180
in the tender.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.200
And,, this company can be addressed

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.020
in the question of finding potential

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.580
contractors.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.980
On the other hand, there is the EventMarket.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.680
ru portal, this is the oldest portal

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.380
in our industry, which has the option

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.260
of announcing a tender.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.320
As a rule, this option is empty, and

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.680
this also allows you to draw conclusions

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.360
about the effectiveness

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.500
of this tool at the moment.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.120
There is a resource EventForum.ru, and

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.980
its founders can also be contacted on

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.580
the issue of announcing a tender.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.760
And finally, there is the EventMarket community.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.320
Despite the coincidence of the name, it

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.120
is not controlled by those people who

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.540
founded the EventMarket.ru portal, but it

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.900
is also an interesting resource

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.980
that allows you to attract Venture's

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.940
attention.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.860
What I must warn you

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.040
about is that all the resources

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.360
that are aimed at creating information

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.540
materials or coordinating interactions

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.560
within the Iveco industry

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.540
are all one way or another

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.720
controlled by some

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.560
Iveco company.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.740
In this regard, if you turn to a resource,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.060
it positions itself as

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.200
independent, but by announcing

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.560
a tender through it, the resource

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.560
is affiliated with a major event

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.380
agency, you involuntarily

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.340
fall into its hands.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.160
In fact, it is easier to find

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.660
out who a site, a community is

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.640
affiliated with and directly

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.420
contact its founders.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.600
On the other hand, there are

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.520
some moves here, and I think that

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.660
despite the fact that Event.ru is

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.700
not a completely independent

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.160
publication, it is the magazine,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.060
the founders of which can be

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.620
contacted on the issue of

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.980
announcing a tender and get

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.260
a more or less adequate independent result.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.140
Next we move to another aspect

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.140
of the event, as a variant of

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.780
the project activity, it is

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.360
to measure the results of the special event.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.980
It must be said that the results

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.040
of its measurement depend on the aim.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.780
We talked about what goals can

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.540
be adequate, and now we have

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.540
to name how the variants

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.220
of calculating the results of

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.980
the event correspond

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.960
to the target.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.780
For example, the increase in brand

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.840
recognition can be measured by

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.000
conducting some sociological

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.800
surveys, appealing to statistics.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.480


00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.360
Publicity, free publications, can

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.620
be measured both quantitatively

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.580
and qualitatively.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.200
The quantitative factor is interesting

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.700
in terms of the information

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.060
effect of the event, but qualitative

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.120
analysis is necessary to determine

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.360
the context of brand mention,

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.900
how well the brand story was dealt

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.180
with in a particular

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.340
article, in a particular material.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.520
Whether the material or just the information

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.000
partners of your industry have

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.600
published a press release of the

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.680
events virtually without changing

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.960
it, it can all be analyzed.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.980
In addition, publicity can

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.560
be determined not only through print,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.240
media and television.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.180
You can also analyze the welfare.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.940
And the mention of blogs, the context

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.360
of these mentions, the presence

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.620
or absence of photo and video materials

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.520
can also be a laxmush paper of

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.320
the effectiveness of the event.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.520
Another criterion is

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.540
the sales.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.740
If you sold your product as

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.600
part of the event, then it can

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.580
be about calculating revenue and profit.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.100
In this case, it is purely

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.220
monetary calculations.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.060
Another criterion is the increase

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.120
in the number of contacts received

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.440
as a result of the event.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.440
I will give an example.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.180
A representative of your company

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.840
participated in a conference

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.380
part of a large exhibition.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.480
He got a number of cards.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.200
We can count how many of these new

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.100
contacts, these new contacts, were.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.460
We can distinguish from this total

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.920
number of new contact persons

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.940
the number of customers

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.840
who can actually interact with

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.240
your company, afford your

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.180
services or purchase your goods.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.800
We can count the total

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.820
number of contacts worked out

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.360
that turned into real orders

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.320
or real purchases.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.520
In principle, there is a certain

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.260
difficulty here, because the speaker

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.460
can work very well and get a

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.420
large number of new

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.960
contacts.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.560
But in the process of further

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.140
work, say, after the event,

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.440
the work may be carried out incorrectly,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.820
the relationship with a

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.620
potential customer may

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.800
be incorrectly built,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.320
the sales process may be

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.580
incorrectly broken.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.420
And in this case, the initial

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.740
good effect may absolutely

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.820
not affect the actual sales.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.600
The next direction of measuring

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.220
the results of the event can

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.920
be team training.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.360
In a learning situation, we can measure

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.600
the skills and knowledge acquired.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.320
In the situation of team training

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.940
events, we measure what new role

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.800
positions have emerged in the team,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.040
how the strengths have changed,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.940
how the leadership strategies

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.700
of certain employees have

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.940
changed, and so on.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.500
We can also measure the

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.380
emotional response of participants,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.940
and it can be measured both post-

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.240
facto by analyzing the

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.980
feedback received about the event,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.300
and by observing the participant

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.140
during the event.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.680
This is also an interesting material

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.520
for analysis.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.530
In conclusion, let’s look

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.430
at what we learned and what

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.010
we learned in the process

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.030
of our video training.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.550
We learned what is event marketing,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.510
as a technology for brand promotion,

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.630
what are the ways to create

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.890
creative concepts of events.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.910
Learn what determines the success

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.830
of individual types of events, why an

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.810
event is a project, how to look for

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.230
the right contractors and how

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.810
determines the degree of effectiveness of the event.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.170
We have learned to create creative concepts

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.730
of events, using different technologies

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.690
of creativity, to align the creative

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.630
concept with the brand platform, to define

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.710
the types and ways of the company

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.770
participating in events of different

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.810
types, to choose the right contractors,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.670
to formulate the optimal goals of

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.810
the event, to find criteria for

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.550
measuring the effectiveness of events.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.170
In conclusion, I would like

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.290
to recommend literature that

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.730
can expand your understanding

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.350
of the technologies of e-commerce.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.870
This is my book “Marketing.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.210
Guide for employers and executives.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.590
The book was released in 2006 and

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.870
is now preparing my new work "101

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.270
cases on event marketing.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.710
The Russian experience.”

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.310
The book of my colleague Alexander

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.430
Shumovich “A magnificent event.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.810
Technology and practice of ivent management.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.170
It is also greatly written and it

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.190
can be interesting as a

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.110
complement to our course.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.590
We talked mainly about

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.310
the marketing tasks of the event,

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.730
and Alexander is specialized

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.810
in the organizational

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.630
component.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.490
There is also a remarkable book

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.090
by German authors Halzbauer and his

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.470
four co-authors, “Event Management”,

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.710
which was published in 2007

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.330
in the edition of “Exma”.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.590
This book is truly monumental,

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.590
it is not by chance that it

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.590
was written by such a large group,

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.350
and in it you can find very useful

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.110
information on both the organizational

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.650
side of special events and

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.310
their marketing component.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.400
The book of Alexander Pasmurov "How

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.140
to effectively prepare and conduct

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.360
a conference, seminar, exhibition"

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.300
may also be useful for you.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.000
The author does not really write

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.200
about all events, but mainly about

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.440
what is called business events,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.640
and has considerable experience in

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.100
organizing special events

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.400
of the business sector.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.380
The book contains many

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.560
recommendations for both the

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.920
organizational plan and

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.260
the communication support

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.960
of special events.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.400
I also recommend you read

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.380
the book by Bernd Schmidt

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.620
and his co-authors “Business in TV.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.760
Marketing of Impressions Culture.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.680
He is one of those authors who

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.960
promotes the concept of entertainment marketing.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.360
He used the term empirical

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.180
marketing.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.220
The book contains several extensive

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.720
cases from the field of event

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.000
marketing and very well motivates

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.160
those who want to adjust

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.080
their minds to the wave of creativity

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.020
and create truly interesting

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.900
and surprising events.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.860
Among the Internet sources I recommend

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.680
the site of the offline edition Event.ru.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.500
It will give you instructions on

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.100

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.620
a lot of useful information for

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.120
those interested in the industry

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.640
of special events.

Good events to you!
