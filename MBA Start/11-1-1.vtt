00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, I am Alexey Nazimko. I am a marketologist, business coach and consultant in the field of event marketing and personal branding.

00:12.000 --> 00:26.000
I am the author of the book Event Marketing. I teach at the Moscow Business School and I am a teacher of the MBA Communication Management program at the Academy of People's Economy.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Our course, created as part of the MBA Start program of the Moscow Business School, is called Event Marketing. It is dedicated to promoting brands through special events.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
A little about the course. The first part of our course is called General Characteristics of Event Marketing.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
It will be dedicated to the general parameters of this area, to what is event marketing, what is it different from event management.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
We will look at the main types and forms of events, as well as the main principles of the success of special events.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
The second part is dedicated to the methods of creativity in event marketing. It consists of two sub-parts.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
First, we will get acquainted with the basic methods of creativity, learn to apply them to the development of creative concepts of special events.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
The second part of this section will be dedicated to my author's concept of benchmarking for special events.

01:20.000 --> 01:36.000
The third part of the course is called The Types of Events. We will look at the main differences of different types of special events, such as exhibitions, BTL, press conferences, corporate events, sponsorship and charity.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
We will learn how to use them with maximum efficiency to promote your brand.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
The fourth part of the course is called Events as a Project. We will touch on the managerial side of the matter, not only the marketing one.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
We will learn about the project characteristics of a special event, how to set goals correctly, how to look for a contractor and measure the results of the event company's return.

02:00.000 --> 02:20.000
Let's look at the categories related to the concept of event marketing. These are advertising, BTL, PR, training industry, training events, intensive training, entertainment marketing, empirical marketing and neuromarketing.

02:20.000 --> 02:44.000
If we talk about the differences between event marketing and advertising, they are quite fundamental. Advertising is traditionally related to the direct impact on the consumer, and event marketing is based on the interactive forms of interaction between the consumer and the direct contact of the client and the brand.

02:44.000 --> 02:57.000
BTL can be perceived as a narrow field of marketing communications, although, of course, BTL industry specialists claim for something more.

02:57.000 --> 03:18.000
To put it more broadly, BTL industry in Russia is a distribution of free food in gastronomy or sampling. But in a broader sense, BTL can be attributed to any image events, presentations that promote the product.

03:18.000 --> 03:41.000
Recently, it has been said that BTL has come out of the underline, has become a full-fledged technology. This is true. I must say that the spread of the event level in the BTL industry is quite large, from simple sampling, which is difficult to call an event in the full sense of the word, to full-scale advertising.

03:41.000 --> 04:05.000
Public relations also claims to expand its subject area. Communication with the public in the narrow sense of the word can be perceived as a press event, if we talk about the event side of the issue. But, of course, any PR person is engaged in promotion, and in this regard, the work of a PR person is very often limited to the work of a marketer, an advertising specialist and BTL.

04:05.000 --> 04:31.000
The training industry is also part of the event industry recently. But here you need to make certain differences, because, of course, educational events can also be called a corporate event. But it is still an educational event, and it is difficult to compare it in the form of, say, promotional events or corporate parties or presentations.

04:31.000 --> 04:50.000
But if the training acquires some event forms, it becomes spectacular, it is taken out of the training audience somewhere outside, into the fields. If a team is formed, then it can be called a corporate event.

04:50.000 --> 05:16.000
Entertainment marketing, empirical marketing, neuromarketing are rather not a direction of marketing communications, but a certain philosophy of marketing, certain approaches to the impact on the consumer. Entertainment marketing or show marketing, as some Russian marketologists have called it, is designed to either train the consumer or entertain him.

05:17.000 --> 05:30.000
At the same time, entertainment is in the first place. If a company is holding educational seminars to bring consumers to the brand, then this is also done in some form of entertainment.

05:30.000 --> 05:48.000
The concepts of empirical marketing and neuromarketing are close to entertainment, but entertainment marketing often emphasizes the use of art presentation tools for the brand, show, art, for marketing purposes.

05:48.000 --> 06:11.000
Empirical marketing and neuromarketing are more narrow concepts. They imply a general marketing approach that includes the impact on the consumer's feelings. It is difficult to say how different empirical marketing and neuromarketing are, but the main idea is that we are immersed in the space of feelings.

06:12.000 --> 06:30.000
We feel smells, we hear sounds, we experience tactile sensations when in contact with the brand, for example, with a package or with some object. And all this must be used to promote the brand without missing a single channel of impact.

06:30.000 --> 06:46.000
As for the event side of the question, event marketing is often conceptualized through the concept of empirical and neuromarketing, saying that it influences the consumer's feelings and implies direct contact with the consumer and the brand.

06:46.000 --> 07:06.000
An important question is how the concepts of event marketing and event management are defined. Some do not define it, some expand the concept of event marketing. For example, often event marketing is called an industry that promotes brands through special events.

07:06.000 --> 07:35.000
But the traditional limitation is that event marketing implies marketing communication tasks, and event management is only a communication component. Very often when you communicate with professional event managers, you find that event managers who have been working in the industry for many years have not heard the word event marketing, if they did not deal with marketing tasks and if they did not require a marketing justification for the effectiveness of special events.

07:36.000 --> 07:58.000
Events in event marketing. The category of events in event marketing is slightly different from the category of events in the usual word of use. It must be said that there are certain difficulties in translation, because the English event and the Russian event have slightly different meanings.

07:58.000 --> 08:18.000
In Russian, we call the word event historical, epochal. As for the English word, the word event is narrower. The Oxford Dictionary translates it as something happened. Thus, the meaning of this word is fixed, that the event is aimed at some changes.

08:18.000 --> 08:41.000
As for the historical events, there is a separate word in English. In this regard, when we translate event marketing, we increase the degree of significance and scale of these events. In this regard, we can say that the language leads us, and Russian event managers are the creators of the history of the brand woven from the events of special events.

08:41.000 --> 09:01.000
Events in event marketing are such an event that changes the attitude of target audiences and the brand and has subjective significance in their eyes. The issue of the attitude of event marketing to integrated marketing communication is often discussed.

09:01.000 --> 09:25.000
To be honest, I am very careful about the concept of integrated marketing communication, because it often does not give anything specific. Naturally, we must integrate something. Naturally, we must direct our marketing efforts to a single goal of promoting the brand, so that the situation of the swan does not turn out to be a cock and a crane,

09:25.000 --> 09:41.000
when each event and each marketing idea promotes us in different directions. But at the same time, this is a very common position, and moreover, it differs depending on what we integrate with.

09:41.000 --> 10:07.000
So, attentive readers of Kotler remember that there is an internal and external marketing environment of the enterprise, and the approach to integrated marketing communication can imply the integration of this external and internal marketing environment. This means that there is the same brand image for their own and, conditionally speaking, for others, for clients, potential partners, those who are outside and for company employees.

10:07.000 --> 10:31.000
Within the framework of recruiting projects, it has recently become fashionable to combine these two directions. For example, if one of the top managers of a large company meets, say, with students, marketers or other specialists whom the company wants to attract to work, this very often gives a marketing effect.

10:31.000 --> 10:49.000
The same applies to advertising in public places, which contains messages of a recruiting nature. This is also advertising for the brand itself. Thus, some events can integrate internal and external tasks.

10:49.000 --> 11:09.000
In addition, there is an integration of a different kind, that is, the integration of various types of marketing communication, when we try to direct to the same task, say, advertising, communication with the public, special events and so on.

11:19.000 --> 11:39.000
For example, the announcement in the press can imply publicity after the event, direct advertising, online promotion, and so on. In this regard, different types of marketing communication can intersect within one event project.

11:39.000 --> 12:08.000
It is also necessary to remember that the basis of the integration of external and internal marketing environment and various ways of communication in event marketing is the brand platform. Therefore, any event marketer, just a marketer who wants to promote his brand through special events, must first look at the brand platform, and then formulate the goals of the event and look for the funds that will be appropriate and reasonable.

12:09.000 --> 12:24.000
Let's talk about event classification. In fact, there can be as many options as you like, because the more criteria we find in the classification, the more types of events we can select. It all depends on what is significant to us.

12:24.000 --> 12:47.000
But we can name some basic criteria that allow us to distinguish between one type of event and another. Naturally, they will be repeated depending on the criteria. Events can be divided by marketing environment into external and internal. Accordingly, we refer to external events, such as promotional promotions, BTL, advertising campaigns, press conferences, and to internal events, such as corporate events, intensive events, and so on.

12:48.000 --> 13:13.000
There is another way of classification. By type of marketing environment, events can be divided into political, corporate, social, cultural, scientific, sports, and so on. In this case, the difference is made more by the tradition of organizing such events, by the nature of the target audience, and by the tasks, whether they are political, commercial, research, and so on.

13:14.000 --> 13:35.000
Events can be divided by the nature of the participants' interaction into formal and informal. In this case, examples can be absolutely any, because today, in terms of changes in the business culture, many events that used to be thought of as exclusively formal acquire an informal nature.

13:35.000 --> 13:50.000
We already hear calls from progressive marketers to organize shows from press conferences and business exhibitions, although these events used to be extremely formalized.

13:50.000 --> 14:11.000
By the scale of the target audience, we can classify events into international, state, corporate, and micro events. We can refer to international events, such as international summits, international conferences, international level sports competitions, official state holidays, inaugurations, and other government events.

14:12.000 --> 14:34.000
We can refer to corporate events, trainings, presentations, and other events that are most often interesting to event organizers. There are also micro events that we rarely mention, but nevertheless, they take place. These are business meetings, romantic dates, organizations of random coincidences, and raffles.

14:34.000 --> 14:46.000
Raffles have become a trend for private events, and they are also very popular, despite the fact that they are micro events, and usually have a good budget.

14:46.000 --> 15:11.000
According to marketing goals, events can be divided into fixed and achieved ones, and those aimed at changing the situation. If we want to fix the achieved results, we can organize a press conference or a corporate event that summarizes the results of long-term activities, say, within a year or half a year.

15:11.000 --> 15:31.000
As for revolutionary events that are supposed to be radical changes, these are often events that are aimed at rebranding the company, or are associated with crisis communications. Something happened, and we need to somehow react to it, improve the image of the company, and so on.

15:31.000 --> 15:47.000
We can also refer to the presentation of a new product, launching new brands, and so on. We can highlight several general principles of the success of special events. The first principle I called the unity and limitation of time and space.

15:47.000 --> 16:10.000
On the one hand, this is quite obvious, because something is really happening somewhere, we call it an event, a number of people participate in the event, the event has a beginning and an end, but on the other hand, many eventers have already faced this situation when the event ceased to be an event due to the violation of this principle.

16:10.000 --> 16:31.000
Why do we need the unity of time? The fact is that events exist only in the perception of the target audience. As they perceive it, so are the events, and so are their results. Therefore, we need the representatives of the target audience, participants of the event, to experience this event together, to experience it together, and to react to it together.

16:31.000 --> 16:48.000
This is why we gather people together, and this is why we need them to be in common space and in common time. On the other hand, it is necessary that the space is limited. For example, imagine that you decided to hold a corporate party for 60 employees at the stadium.

17:01.000 --> 17:17.000
When this event ends, your audience will simply scatter in this huge space, so some limitation is always necessary. The same applies to time. It is very important that a person perceives that there is a beginning of an event and there is an end to it. Many companies have already faced this.

17:17.000 --> 17:38.000
I want to give an example. For example, in Siberia there is a festival of the alternative theater of Sibaltra. When this brand was launched, it was a festival that lasted about a week and included a lot of performances. But then the owners of this brand decided to commercialize it throughout the year.

17:38.000 --> 18:04.000
As a result, the festival began to fade away, because there was no clearly allocated festival time. The performance was held all year under the brand Sibaltra. In this regard, the event brand fades away and the company turns into a purely promotional one that promotes alternative productions throughout the year. This should be remembered.

18:04.000 --> 18:22.000
The second principle of success of an event is the principle of an attraction. There are different types of attractions. In art theory, this is well worked out. There is an attraction of ugliness, an attraction of disasters, an attraction of beauty. I wrote about this in my book.

18:22.000 --> 18:40.000
But here we need to remember that whatever attraction we arrange for the consumer, we must surprise him with something. If the point of surprise does not come, then the event is not an event, it is just an event for a tick.

18:40.000 --> 18:56.000
For example, when you come to a gastronome and see another sampling, again a promo for a girl, again a stand, again they offer you to try the product. Of course, as an event, you do not perceive it for yourself, it is just an episode. It can't surprise you.

18:56.000 --> 19:16.000
On the other hand, if you see an unusual object, even an unusual growth figure in the same gastronome, then most likely you will be interested in it and you can even tell your friends about it, especially if you manage to involve the organizer of the event in some interaction.

19:16.000 --> 19:31.000
The third principle is called the principle of mutual exchange. This is related to the psychology of the unconscious. The fact is that since ancient times in human society it has developed in such a way that we try to respond to what we have been done.

19:31.000 --> 19:48.000
In general, it is very beneficial to do good to people in this regard, because if you, for example, stretch a person's hand, then assume that he will stretch it in response, otherwise it will be just rudeness. If you greet someone, then assume that they will greet you, and then ask who you are.

19:48.000 --> 20:09.000
The same applies to special events. If you organize a good vacation for employees, or organize a good show for consumers, or engage in free training for consumers, presenting a new variety of computer technology, then usually you are paid for good.

20:09.000 --> 20:35.000
Of course, there is no such strict rule that if, for example, a journalist came to a press event, he must make a publication. Moreover, the quality of the brochure does not always affect the publication activity. Nevertheless, if you organized something really interesting that your target audience liked, the chances of getting monetary return from this are greatly increased.

20:35.000 --> 20:52.000
The fourth principle is the principle of ritualistic action. This is also a psychological factor of special events. The fact is that there is a festive stereotype. What is a holiday for the mass audience?

20:52.000 --> 21:12.000
It is a disco, a performance of artists, a banquet, and so on. When we start organizing corporate events, we face a contradiction. The audience is waiting for one thing, and we need to surprise it and come up with something else.

21:12.000 --> 21:32.000
In this regard, in order to create a truly interesting special event, you need to observe the balance of social rituals that are practiced, say, in the event of a business conference or a corporate holiday, and what you can offer your audience.

21:32.000 --> 21:51.000
If you completely go into the ritual scheme, the event will cease to be an event and become an event for a tick. If you find something new, it is important not to get carried away, because by destroying social conventions, you can get out of the space of attention and interaction with your target audience.

21:51.000 --> 22:15.000
The fifth principle is the principle of subjectivity. Events always exist in the consciousness of target audiences, as does the brand. This makes the concept of event marketing absolutely marketing and branding. If the event is perceived as significant to the target audience, then you can say that you have achieved what you wanted and the event is organized.

22:15.000 --> 22:35.000
If this does not happen, then we have a regular event. We must always remember that in addition to the direct reaction of target audiences, this reaction can be designed in the future, when the event is already completed, and thus prolong the communication effect of the event.

22:35.000 --> 22:56.000
What do I mean? Let's say people came to the event, they didn't like something there, and they had a negative impression of the event about the brand. Some time passes, and the details of what caused the negative are forgotten, and here comes the usual PR.

22:56.000 --> 23:15.000
For example, you post good reviews of some participants of the event on the website, or you post information about the success stories associated with a particular event on a corporate website or in a corporate newspaper.

23:15.000 --> 23:31.000
Seeing that there is a general idea of ​​a positive event, some representatives of the target audience, skeptical, begin to change their opinion, they begin to think, maybe something was really good, and so on.

23:31.000 --> 23:55.000
Of course, the event should be high-quality, it should be planned so as not to cause a negative impression to the audience, but we must always remember that public opinion can also be designed, and events are not just some actions within the event, but all the space of perception of the brand and the event that exists outside the event when it is already completed.

23:56.000 --> 24:21.000
The sixth principle of success is called the principle of dramatization. I think that event managers should learn from directors of theatrical productions, directors of films, writers, because any work of art has its heroes, has some development, has a climax, has a culmination, and has an effective ending.

24:22.000 --> 24:47.000
The same characteristics should be used for a successful marketing event. Why is this necessary? Very often, the concept of an event in words is formulated. On the one hand, this is very difficult from the point of view of selling the event as a marketing tool, and on the other hand, it is difficult from the point of view of selling the event directly to its participants,

24:48.000 --> 25:00.000
because the participant reads the announcements of the event, then he reads reports about the event, and he wants to be formulated in words, what was there, what happened, what was in the event so unusual.

25:01.000 --> 25:17.000
If we think in terms of visual images, in the principle of making us beautiful, then we represent the picture of the event. This is very good, because then photos from the event can be posted on blogs, on websites, in newspapers, and the information effect can be prolonged in this way.

25:17.000 --> 25:31.000
But the picture is always static, and in this regard, visual images are not self-sufficient for us. We can come up with an interesting design of the event, we can hold the event in an unusual place, and this is not bad in itself.

25:31.000 --> 25:44.000
But if there is no internal dynamics, if there is no story that the participants of the event live through, then in the end we will simply have nothing to say about what happened.

25:45.000 --> 26:01.000
The principle of dramatization is also important for communication with the press, because in addition to the visual image, the journalist needs to predict something about the event, something that happened there, something that made some changes.

26:01.000 --> 26:16.000
In this regard, it is very important at the stage of planning the event to see its dynamics, its structural units, its composition, almost in the artistic sense, including the literary work, and to be able to formulate the concept of the event in words.

26:16.000 --> 26:36.000
We move on to practical questions from the general understanding of the strategy of event marketing. We move on to the question of how to create the concept of special events and at the same time make them creative.

26:36.000 --> 26:51.000
There are certain difficulties in the event industry, despite the fact that it grows by almost 25% every year, and there are more good events that can be told and written about.

26:51.000 --> 27:05.000
This is due to several reasons, which cause a fairly low level of creativity in special events. First, this is the complexity of the organizational part of the event.

27:05.000 --> 27:28.000
Years pass before the event manager goes from the task of organizing events to creative tasks. Especially when it comes to mass events, they include a lot of structural elements and it is quite difficult to coordinate internal logistics and events.

27:29.000 --> 27:44.000
Now the event industry is at the stage when we already have good technology for organizing events and good event managers, and therefore we begin to think about how to make events truly interesting.

27:44.000 --> 27:59.000
The second factor that affects the low level of creativity in the event industry is the ritualistic nature of the holiday. This is the holiday stereotype that I have already mentioned.

27:59.000 --> 28:16.000
If there is a certain horizon of expectations from the target audience, then very often the organizers and organizers of special events simply go along the usual path of satisfying these needs and justifying these expectations.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
Although in fact, you need to come up with something else to surprise the target audience, and this is what creative technology is for.

28:25.000 --> 28:42.000
Another factor that reduces the level of creativity in events is low budgets. This thesis is quite controversial, because on the one hand, the limitation of budgets often makes you give up on many interesting ideas.

28:42.000 --> 28:58.000
On the other hand, the limitation of resources is a trigger that triggers creativity mechanisms, makes company representatives and event agents come up with something really interesting.

28:58.000 --> 29:26.000
This is often called KVN marketing, when creativity outweighs the budget of events. Indeed, we can look at the events produced by different companies and find that large corporations arrange rather trivial events, while small and medium-sized businesses are alluring and create interesting creative concepts.

29:26.000 --> 29:39.000
This is why funky marketing and funky business are often primarily related to the post-industrial segment and primarily to small and medium-sized businesses.

29:39.000 --> 29:59.000
Another factor that certainly affects the reduction of the level of creativity in events is that in any advertising agency there are already proven and worked out creative methods that are used to train employees, to come to work, to train advertisers.

29:59.000 --> 30:14.000
But no one is preparing event managers, so they have to come up with these creative ideas on their own, without using special technologies. We already have them, and we will learn this during our course.

30:14.000 --> 30:31.000
It is also important to note that the event itself assumes creativity, it separates it from the event, because it is creativity that creates the ability to surprise its target audience and make the event truly significant in their eyes.

30:31.000 --> 30:59.000
There are quite a few creative methods, and the use of certain technologies depends on a specific person, on his or her personal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to test various ways of generating creative ideas during training and choose what is most convenient for everyone. But without trying, we cannot find out about it. So, let's go!

30:59.000 --> 31:21.000
Now we will consider a training case where we will train and develop creative ideas. This is the brand of Caterpillar clothes and shoes. Many of you know that Caterpillar produces working equipment, but in addition they have a promo brand and a separate direction of Caterpillar activities.

31:21.000 --> 31:48.000
Caterpillar is a working clothing brand. If we describe the platform of this brand, we can say that it focuses on anti-glamour, utility and work aesthetics. These clothes and shoes have long gone beyond the framework of the purely work sphere, they are worn in everyday wear, and therefore the brand needs to expand its client base.

31:48.000 --> 32:14.000
In addition to accessories and clothing items that exist constantly in collections, there are also seasonal collections that require promotion. The shows of the new Caterpillar collections and the presentation of these new collections will be the task on which we will work on our creative technologies within the framework of our training.

32:15.000 --> 32:36.000
The first and perhaps one of the most common creative methods is brainstorming. Almost everyone has heard about it and almost everyone knows its basic rules. Just in case, we will repeat them. During a brainstorming, the versions are not criticized, they are only expressed, and only then discussed.

32:36.000 --> 32:45.000
The time in the framework of a brainstorming is limited, and it is necessary to create as many creative ideas as possible within it.

32:46.000 --> 33:06.000
The third rule of a brainstorming is that the criticism of all ideas is carried beyond the framework of the brainstorming itself and is carried out later. There are different types of brainstorming. Sometimes ideas are simply expressed verbally, and someone fixes them, and then there is a discussion.

33:07.000 --> 33:28.000
But if you experience some organizational difficulties, if the members of the design group are inclined to interrupt each other and still proceed to discuss ideas, or feel some kind of uncertainty, then you can conduct a silent brainstorming, simply writing down your versions on pieces of paper and then only voicing them during the discussion.

33:29.000 --> 33:43.000
We move on to the first task. We will need to come up with at least five ideas for the presentation of the new collection of the Caterpillar clothing brand. The recommended time for completing the task is 10 minutes.

33:55.000 --> 34:03.000
I congratulate you on your successful completion of the task 1. I think you all have done it.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
Let's see what answers could be given.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
The answers that I and my trainees offer.

34:12.000 --> 34:21.000
For example, you can attach the presentation of the Caterpillar brand to the day of spring labor, to May 1.

34:22.000 --> 34:32.000
Another version suggests that you can give a stamp with a boot print of Caterpillar to the best partners who have left their mark on the history of the brand's development.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
Another creative idea involves a presentation in the planetarium.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
The future, which remains in the lives of earthlings, is recognized only by Caterpillar.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
This is such a futurological concept of event promotion of this brand.

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
You can hold a presentation in a sandy quarry and pour champagne to guests using Caterpillar's work equipment.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
This allows you to integrate the presentation of the brand's clothes and work equipment.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
It is a reminder of the company's main specialization.

35:04.000 --> 35:13.000
You can also hold a show of a new collection, which will be presented by the best workers, farmers of Moscow and Moscow region.

35:13.000 --> 35:23.000
Thus, the company becomes the core of its target audience and can promote the work equipment and clothing brand at the same time.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Any creative technology has advantages and disadvantages.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The brainstorming is no exception.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
The advantage of the brainstorming is that it allows you to organize the process of generating ideas.

35:36.000 --> 35:46.000
Often, in an authoritarian leadership, conditions are created for employees to express their ideas, and not just follow their leaders.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
This is also one of the advantages of the brainstorming.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
At the same time, the brainstorming is not self-sufficient, because in its process we only record ideas,

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
but we have no idea what is happening in the space of the skull of the participants in the discussion.

36:02.000 --> 36:11.000
The brainstorming creates some basic prerequisites for the creation of an idea, but does not affect the creative strategy of the participants.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
We move on to the creative technology 6 hats by De Bono.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
It is also well known.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
Sometimes, the participants of the creative group really wear colored hats.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Sometimes they are just given roles.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
The role of the white hat is to analyze the numbers and facts without passion.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
The role of the black hat is to express negative judgments.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
The yellow hat, on the contrary, expresses only positive judgments about any idea or concept.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
The green hat is the role of the supposed creative beginning, expressing creative ideas.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
The red hat expresses emotional reactions, and the blue one summarizes the results.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Task 2.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
During the brainstorming, we received an offer to make a show of the new collection of caterpillars in a space style.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
In the future, space colonists will recognize only the caterpillar.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
Refer to this idea from the position of each of the 6 hats.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
The recommended time for completing the task is 10 minutes.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
We are testing the results.

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
I created several statements that can reflect the position of each of the 6 hats

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
regarding the futurological concept of the promotion of the brand Caterpillar.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
The white hat.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
The number of consumers of clothing and shoes Caterpillar, represented by the working class,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
is decreasing along with the decrease of the working class itself.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
The search for a new audience involves the use of popular masculine images,

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
which can be the image of the future presented in American blockbusters.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
The final decision requires a comprehensive study,

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
a survey and a deep interview, and consideration of other alternatives.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
We must responsibly approach the development of a concept

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
that involves large investments from the company's right holders.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
The black hat.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Nonsense. Caterpillar is a working brand.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Working in the future? Let's say so.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Maybe in the age of high technology everyone will become Marxists

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and wear it in solidarity?

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
Plus, to create a full-fledged legend, you need support from ELKA in communications,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
advertising, product placement in the cinema, and so on.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
One show is not enough for such a legend.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The yellow hat.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
The idea is definitely good.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Worker aesthetics in Russia is associated only with the Soviet past.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
There are fewer and fewer workers in the country.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
To buy clothes, you need to attract office plankton,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
and they see the world through a TV and a computer monitor.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
You can't find the images of workers on TV and in the cinema now.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
But there are characters like the heroes of the Fifth Element and The Matrix.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
They are kind of in the center of high technology,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
and kind of at the bottom.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Such a futurological tragedy.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
Office boys can be carried away by Marxist ideas and any other revolutionary nonsense.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
Their life is so boring that every cleric in his soul sees himself as a hero of the Fight Club.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
The green hat.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Let's organize this in the Center for the Preparation of Astronauts.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
The red hat.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Well, I don't know.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
When I presented this event, I thought,

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Wow, it might turn out great, but first I need to see it.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
When I see it, I'll understand what it is like.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
Maybe it will be a masterpiece, or maybe I won't like it at all.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
The blue hat.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
With all the pros and cons, I believe that the decision to develop a futurological legend is reasonable.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
It can be implemented in real life after a detailed study of the concept

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
in case of approval by the majority of the votes in the Board of Directors.

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
Let's go back to the 6 hats technology and evaluate it from the point of view of possible advantages and disadvantages.

40:00.000 --> 40:08.000
When you were doing this task, you probably noticed that it was difficult for you to identify yourself with this or that hat.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
But you did it in writing, and in the situation of working discussion,

40:13.000 --> 40:24.000
it is very often that this excessive unusuality of the form of discussion does not allow this technology to be implemented.

40:24.000 --> 40:30.000
Many managers find it strange that they will wear hats or play some kind of role-playing game.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
At the same time, there are undoubted advantages of the technology,

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
and they are related to the optimization of role-playing roles in the creative group.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Very often, an authoritative leader presses the group,

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
and as a result, the discussion is reduced to adopting the original strategy of the leader.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
Therefore, in order to introduce an element of inequality in the discussion,

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
in order to be able to express different positions on a particular creative idea,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
it is necessary to create some special conditions, special rules,

41:05.000 --> 41:12.000
such as the De Bono method, the six hats, which allow you to relate to ideas from different sides.

41:12.000 --> 41:20.000
On the other hand, you noticed that during the use of the six hats method,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
the creative ideas themselves are not generated,

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
they exist in order to relate to the already existing concepts or ideas.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Therefore, the six hats technology is effective,

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
but it is effective in discussing strategies and in making management decisions,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
and not in generating creative ideas.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
We move on to the mental map method.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
This is also one of the basic methods of creativity.

41:49.000 --> 41:58.000
It consists of creating an association chain around an axiomatic word, a brand, or an event.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
You see on the slide such a map.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
The key word is associated with the arrows,

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
association 1, association 2, association 3, and so on.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
In turn, from the association of the first order,

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
you can build arrows that lead us to the subsequent associations.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
What is it for?

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
In order to create a meaningful field of the brand,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
you need to see what it can be associated with,

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
and based on these associations, come up with a creative idea for a special event.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Task 3. Based on the mental map method,

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
make a tree of associations with the brand of the Caterpillar clothes.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
The recommended time to complete the task is 7 minutes.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Task 3. Based on the mental map method,

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
make a tree of associations with the brand of the Caterpillar clothes.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
We check the results.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
You see on the slide a simple scheme.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It can be complicated.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
The associations of the second and third order can be introduced.

43:03.000 --> 43:09.000
So, there is Caterpillar, the basic association is a tractor, a working vehicle,

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
the second association is workers, the third association is a factory and labor.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Later we will see how this associative field can work

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
in the invention of creative strategies for special events.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
The mental map method has its advantages and disadvantages.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
The advantages can be attributed to the relative simplicity of the form.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
You just draw a scheme on a sheet of paper,

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
and it makes you think about what the brand is associated with.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
Undoubtedly, the mental map method pumps the creator's consciousness,

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
makes him see all the new possibilities of the brand conceptualization.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
But there are also disadvantages.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Warming up is not the very generation of creative ideas.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
The mental map method creates good prerequisites for creating an idea.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
But it is not the very creation of the idea.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
Therefore, having created a mental map of the brand,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
you need to switch to other creative methods

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
in order to create a creative idea.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Another disadvantage of the mental map method

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
is that when the tree of associations is made,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
the association is often owned by the creator himself,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
a member of the creative group,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
and not the target audience to which the brand is directed.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Therefore, it is very important to supplement this creative strategy

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
and think about what the brand is associated with.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
What are the associations that are authentic for this brand,

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
and not for the creator, who has some individual features and associations?

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
We move on to the method of search for the opposite.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It is very simple.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
If we were looking for direct associations within the mental map method,

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
then we will look for the concept of antonyms within the search for the opposite.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
And the fourth task of our video training is formulated on the basis of this method.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Task 4.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
Come up with a concept for presenting a new collection of Caterpillar clothes

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
using the technology of reverse associations.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
Imagine something that is consonant and opposite to the working aesthetics of Caterpillar

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
and combine both components in the concept of a special event.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
The recommended time for completing the task is 10 minutes.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
We check the results.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
This is the version that one of the participants of my training suggested.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
He suggested organizing a collection show in some pathos place,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
for example, in a historical building in the Baroque style,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
invite VIP guests from the fashion world,

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
offer them an evening dress code.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
At the same time, the entourage of the building and the image of the guests

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
will contrast very sharply with the collection shown.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
On the one hand, this is a certain risk,

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
because there is a discrepancy between the target audience

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
and the core of the target audience of the Caterpillar brand in this case.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
But nevertheless, this concept can be productive,

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
because it combines the opposite,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
that is, glamour and anti-glamour,

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
the working aesthetics and the aesthetics of the social society,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
high and low.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
And in this regard, such a contrast will be remembered for a long time.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
Let's recall the words of the hero Gérard Depardieu from the film

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
The Hotel. Harmony and contrast create beauty.

47:00.000 --> 47:06.000
There are advantages and disadvantages of the method of opposite associations.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
On the one hand, harmony and contrast,

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
what I was talking about, is always very impressive,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
it is remembered by the target audience.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
On the other hand, the associative thinking is somewhat more complicated here.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
You probably noticed that it is much easier to perform tasks

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
using the mental cards method.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
You are just looking for a direct association,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
it happens quite involuntarily.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
But when we are looking for something opposite

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
and combine it with what is already part of the associative field of the brand,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
it is a slightly more complicated procedure.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
I know from experience that some of my training participants

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
do not immediately cope with this task.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Therefore, if you did not succeed right away,

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
but having learned about a good option for this task,

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
you have some ideas, try to complete the task again.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
In any case, this creative method is on par with the mental cards method,

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
because it involves combining direct and opposite associations with the brand.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
The basic disadvantage of this technology, like many others,

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
is that this technology creates only the prerequisites for creating a creative idea,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
not the idea itself.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Unfortunately, creativity is a great mystery,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
so we are just trying to introduce some algorithms

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
to increase the probability of achieving the result.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
Nevertheless, we cannot fully measure and prescribe the creative process.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
We move on to the morphological analysis technology.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
The word is familiar, we know the morphology in philological science,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
in the science of words, it studies the structure of words.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
There is a morphology of plants that studies the structure of plants.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
Special events have their own structure and morphology.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
In order to apply the creative technology of morphological analysis,

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
it is necessary to first decompose the object into components,

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
to see what the event consists of, what is included in it.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
As a rule, these are the same components,

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
for example, sound, visual series, place where the event takes place,

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
time when the event takes place, target audience, and so on.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
But specific forms of the event, for example, in our case,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
this is a show of a new fashion collection,

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
specific forms of the event have their own specifics

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
and their own components that are integral.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
So we identify these components, then we divide them into parts,

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
change one or more elements and carry out a new assembly.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
And what we get is often an unpredictable option,

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
but this is creativity, when the expectations of the target audience

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
are combined with something new, fresh, with what the creator has invented.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Hence our next task.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Task 5.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
Come up with a concept for presenting a new collection of Caterpillar clothes

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
using morphological analysis technology.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Imagine a visual image of the show,

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
divide it into components, change one of the components

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
and assemble the image together.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
The recommended time to complete the task is 10-15 minutes.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Let's check the results.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
In the slide you can see a standard version of the Fashion Pokaza device.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
There is a background, which usually has the logo of the clothing company.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
There is a podium, or a tongue, as it is called.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
The models walk on it from the back.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
On the sides, along the podium, there are the first rows of guests.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
And at the end of the podium there are fashion photographers.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
This is what the show usually consists of.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
We can hardly change it,

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
but we can modify it somehow to make the show more interesting in form.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
Here is the solution that was proposed by one of the participants of my training.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
We replace the podium with a conveyor,

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
and the show hall with a hangar or a factory room.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
We combine the resulting elements,

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
and we get a creative concept for a special event,

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
a Fashion Pokaza, which is transferred to the space of a factory workshop

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
or some production room.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
This also creates a very interesting contrast,

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
because on the one hand, the world of fashion is, as a rule, a world of glamour,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
and there is a certain audience of clothing shows.

51:50.000 --> 51:57.000
On the other hand, this obvious anti-glamour contrasts with the expectations of the audience.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
The morphological analysis has its advantages and disadvantages.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
The advantage, oddly enough, is in the simplicity of the form.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
You can't immediately understand how to do it,

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
but when a participant of the training heard at least one example,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
solved at least one case,

52:17.000 --> 52:26.000
he can usually apply the same technology to create a concept of special events for other brands,

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
because to decompose the image of a special event into a component that can change something

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
and put it all together is a rather simple thinking task.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
In this regard, you can use this technology in a number of cases

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
when creating a concept of special events.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
And, of course, this technology is very effective,

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
at least due to the fact that it is effective,

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
and this is really necessary for the event promotion of the brand.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
Nevertheless, the question remains open,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
is there an object that we can decompose into a component?

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
The technology was created as an inventor to create new, non-standard products and solutions.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
For special events, the event is certainly not an object,

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
so we usually deal only with the subject environment

53:22.000 --> 53:28.000
and modulate the visual appearance of the event to a greater extent than its dramaturgy.

53:28.000 --> 53:36.000
In this regard, there are certainly disadvantages and shortcomings of morphological analysis as a creative technology.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
We move on to the description of creative technology organized inside.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
This is a very interesting and my favorite method.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
The fact is that the brand is not in a certain vacuum,

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
and marketing tasks are also not in the middle of an empty space.

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
There are collective ideas of the target audience of the brand,

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
there are social practices that are typical for the brand audience,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
and all this needs to be studied.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
In order to come up with a creative strategy for a special event

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
that is authentically promoted by the brand,

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
you need to plunge into its semantic space.

54:14.000 --> 54:21.000
To do this, you need to use the information sources that are somehow associated with the brand.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
Inside is a technology that involves several basic installations.

54:27.000 --> 54:33.000
First, the answer is already in our consciousness, we just have to extract it from there.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
In principle, any person, using one or another creative technology,

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
can create a creative concept of a special event to a certain extent.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Therefore, you need to create the necessary conditions for this.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
The second installation is that the information environment that you surround yourself with

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
can speed up the process of searching for a creative solution.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Task 6.

54:57.000 --> 55:04.000
List as many information sources as possible that reflect the style of the Caterpillar brand.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
The recommended time to complete the task is 7 minutes.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Checking the results.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
These are the options that could be proposed in application to this task.

55:25.000 --> 55:36.000
You can use various architectural forms for awakening creative ideas,

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
which are somehow associated with the traditions of the working environment,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
industrial production, and so on.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
It is necessary to remember that Caterpillar has its own legend,

55:48.000 --> 55:57.000
so it is best to use American or at least foreign visual samples that will help you come up with an idea.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
You can use, for example, albums that somehow reflect the Bauhaus style,

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
or the aesthetics of the architecture of brick factories of the early 20th century.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
You can walk along the corresponding streets of Moscow or other cities,

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
where there are buildings with large windows, brick factory pipes.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
In addition, it is necessary to remember that some architectural objects are already modified

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
and adapted for special events,

56:24.000 --> 56:31.000
so such a walk can be quite productive in terms of organizational tasks.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
You can use old photos from industrial and agricultural history, preferably foreign.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
You can also try to use information sources that are somehow associated with the Russian Revolution,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
with trade unions, and so on,

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
in order to borrow visual forms, ideas, quotes, and so on.

56:51.000 --> 56:58.000
This is all the information environment that can push you to discover creative ideas.

56:58.000 --> 57:04.000
In addition, you need to remember that the information you collect can be used

57:04.000 --> 57:11.000
for the design of special events, for printing products, for the production of invitations,

57:11.000 --> 57:18.000
for interesting options for finding music that is authentic to this event,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
visual series, and so on.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
There may even be smells and architectural space.

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
All this will undoubtedly help you create an interesting and memorable event.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
As an advantage of the organized insight technology,

57:33.000 --> 57:40.000
it can be called that it provides the creator with a meaningful and stylistic space of the brand.

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
You surround yourself with objects, sounds, and information sources that are authentic to the brand,

57:47.000 --> 57:55.000
and this allows you to create a strategy that will meet the spirit and expectations of the target audience.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
On the other hand, there are also disadvantages.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
What if the sea has no weather? What if the idea doesn't come to you?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Like most creative technologies,

58:05.000 --> 58:12.000
the organized insight creative technology is designed to push you to find a creative idea,

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
but it certainly does not guarantee that the idea will necessarily arise in your mind.

58:18.000 --> 58:28.000
This can be added to the fact that a competent marketer is always trying to find some important information for himself.

58:28.000 --> 58:38.000
He turns to sociological questions, he tries to go through and live the life that his target audience lives.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
In order to expand the Caterpillar case, we can give another example from the field of child marketing.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
If you are a marketer in a production that produces children's goods,

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
you may be interested in literature on child psychology,

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
which relates to that age period that your target audience represents.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
You may be interested in the mechanism of decision-making,

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
about the purchase, how difficult it is for children's subcultures and parents to interact with each other,

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
who give their children money for certain acquisitions.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
You may be interested in teenage magazines,

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
you may be interested in sociological studies on the child subculture, and so on.

59:20.000 --> 59:26.000
All this information is productive in order to create interesting creative strategies.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
And we move on to the next section.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
It reflects the benchmarking technology.

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
Although very often stereotypical thinking is called the opposite of creativity,

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
nevertheless, creativity is fundamentally different from creativity.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
First of all, it is the creator's institutions.

59:45.000 --> 59:52.000
A creative person tries to think by embodying some commandments from above.

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
We often find this when we read memoirs of artists and writers.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
He tries to create something fundamentally new.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
As for the creator, he understands that it is difficult to create something fundamentally new,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
so he creates something new based on the old.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And if there is a shift in the existing stereotypical pattern,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
we are already dealing with creativity.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
This is the right task that every specialist can set for himself.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Benchmarking is a very popular technology today.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It involves the transfer of a creative scheme or a management solution from one area to another.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I will give you an example.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Let's say you are the manager of a fast-food restaurant,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and you have problems with logistics,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
how semi-finished products are brought, how they are prepared, how they are distributed to the buyer.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You look at what industries, what social spheres have similar problems.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And pay attention to the high-tech logistics scheme of airlines.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The plane arrives at the airport, and a very quick inspection is carried out,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the trays with breakfast, dinner, coffee, and so on are placed there very quickly.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And you can see how the general scheme is implemented.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
When you bring this management solution scheme to some basic parameters,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000
you can try to replace the word airport with the word catering service,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
or salon with the word restaurant,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and see if you can use similar techniques in your business.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Something similar happens in event marketing.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I am now working on the book "101 Case on event marketing",

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
and I conducted a fairly large-scale study,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
monitoring several hundred Russian event companies.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And I found at some point that almost all creative solutions are similar to each other.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
If we find something that surprises us,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
then by way of obtaining a creative idea,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
it may be similar to another concept of a special event, made for another brand.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
All this is due to the fact that there are not so many creative strategies.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I suggest you familiarize yourself with some strategies for developing creative ideas for special events.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
By transferring this creative scheme to the situation of your brand,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
you will be able to see how you can implement your tasks.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The analysis of creative solutions in the Russian event industry showed

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
that all ideas can be divided into several types.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
We will consider them, and at the same time we will see how the solutions that we have already received

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
within the framework of the Caterpillar case solution

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
could be achieved if we used benchmarking technologies.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
As I said, different creative technologies can lead to the same solutions.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
You just need to choose a convenient way for you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The first benchmarking option is called an unusual object in a familiar space.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I have selected one of the recent examples for you.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
This is a beer promotion called Kirin.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You can see a sumo wrestler in an inflatable suit

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
who performs some strange actions by sliding down the stairs on a bicycle.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Of course, in this case, the emphasis is on the fact that something unusual happens in the familiar space of the urban environment.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Therefore, both the passer-by and the passer-by immediately pay attention to this.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It should be said that the beer promotion Kirin used integrated marketing communications.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
A promotional site of the product was created.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
In addition to these creative actions that were carried out on the streets,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:24.000
promoters recruited supporters of this brand, creating a club of fun pranks.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This is also a kind of event promotion of the brand.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Those people who joined the community formed around the beer site Kirin

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:44.000
could participate in a flash mob and play a game with someone from the familiar participants of this community.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Thus, the promotion continued, the information effect was prolonged,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and the sales figures show that the promotion was not in vain.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
However, it is difficult to establish a correlation here,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
because somewhere in the time period close to the promotion,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
the prices for this beer brand were reduced.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Therefore, it is very difficult to establish a direct relationship between the promotion and the sales results.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Nevertheless, this is undoubtedly one of the good creative projects.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Another case of benchmarking is direct association.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You remember how we drew mental cards.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:37.000
The associations of the first row, which are directly derived from our brand or product,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
are the associations that are most productive in creating the concept of special events.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:51.000
In this case, as an example, I bring the briefing of the mortgage department of Delta Bank.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
This event was organized by one of the teachers of the Moscow School of Business, Inna Alekseeva.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:06.000
The idea was to have informal communication between the journalists and the top managers of Delta Bank.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
As you know, most press events are quite standard.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
These are speaking heads, the presidium, the moderator, questions, answers.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
In this regard, it is very difficult to find a creative solution.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
In the slide, in the picture, you can see that the event was not very effective.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But if you include it in the context of a large number of gray and monotonous press events,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
then, undoubtedly, it was creative.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
First of all, everyone was in slippers, in Delta Bank's branded robes.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Journalists were able to take the Delta slippers with them.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Cats walked around the office.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
In general, this home atmosphere was recreated.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Since this is a mortgage department, a direct association was carried out.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
This is an example of a direct association.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000
All creative ideas built on the associations Caterpillar, the factory, workers, for example, moving the show to the workshop,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
are applied to the Caterpillar brand, the case we were considering.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
These are all ideas that represent the association of the first order.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The third type of benchmarking is grotesque.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
The third type of benchmarking is grotesque.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
As an example, I have brought a collective image.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
This is the Paris agency, which belongs to Alexei Svestunov.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Alexei Svestunov built a whole business on the Russian book of Guinness records and on the setting of records.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Of course, the record can be artifacted in different ways, and it is not necessarily associated with the holding of a special event.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But in general, in some cases, an event is attributed to the setting of the record.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And of course, the record becomes an event if it is properly covered in the press and the information about it is brought to the target audiences.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Grotesque is used everywhere.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:16.000
In the case of fat sumo wrestlers in inflatable suits, which ride around the city on bicycles, this is also a grotesque option.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
It just so happened that in advertising and in promotion technologies, we must be convincing,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:30.000
we must use such bright, exaggerated, poster forms of conveying our message in order to be heard.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
We can give an example from the case we have already considered, the Caterpillar.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.000
For example, if champagne is poured using construction equipment, this is a grotesque option, clearly exaggerated.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Or if we say that in the future space colonists will choose only Caterpillar, this is also a grotesque promotion option of the brand,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
because it is associated with the revolutionary idea of ​​the victory of some one brand,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and revolution is always grotesque, it is always something very large-scale, powerful, and so on.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
The next benchmarking option is the allocation of the aspect of everyday life.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Here, the technology of organized insight helps us a lot.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I said that it is always necessary to observe your target audiences and record their collective representations and cultural practices.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
As an example of this benchmarking option, the action of the magazine Samaya was chosen.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000
You can see on the picture on the slide that about a dozen girls in the subway read the magazine Samaya.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Naturally, the rest of the passengers pay attention to this.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
On the one hand, this is a bit grotesque, because not all women can read the same magazine,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the market offers us more variety.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
On the other hand, this, of course, draws attention to itself, and it must be said that the action was successful,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
although it had certain drawbacks.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It seems that it was authentic to the target audience,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
middle-aged women go to work in the subway and read some kind of women's magazine.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:21.000
On the other hand, the promo girls who were used to hold this action did not represent an age group of the target audience.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
They were much younger.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
In this regard, there was some contradiction.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
On the one hand, the promo action itself corresponds to the spirit of the brand,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
and on the other hand, those who represent the brand do not belong to the target group.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000
This is a natural obstacle, because we know that mostly young people work in the BTL industry.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The next benchmarking option is the unification of cultural practices.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
As an example, I gave the musicals of the foreign language school Mr. English.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000
This is a case that has already received good publicity in Russian business media.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
The idea is very interesting.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
When we talk about learning a foreign language,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
we can see a classroom, a group that performs some tasks, a textbook, a blackboard or a flip chart.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
We reproduce an educational stereotype in our consciousness.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000
But in order to organize a special action that promotes educational institutions,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
you need something more vivid.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
The school leaders found this way for themselves.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000
They began to organize musicals in foreign languages and turned it into a separate business.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
A separate promotional site was created for the musicals of the Mr. English school.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Several musicals have already been staged.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Target auditions are held.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Groups are working in which participants are trained.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
This is a very good promotion option,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
because it allows to attract a large enough audience,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
to attract friends of the participants, their parents.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
This is also a loyalty program.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Therefore, this is a very spectacular and bright option,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
especially applicable to the educational institution.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If we talk about the example of the Caterpillar case, which was in our decisions,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000
then any contrast between various cultural practices, fashion, work, everyday life,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
all creative decisions based on this contrast can be attributed to this type of benchmarking.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
The next benchmarking option is the event potential of the brand.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
This is how it is called.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
The fact is that very often the brand is already included in some social practices,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
which are associated with events and special events.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
As an example, I brought the Sergei Pupynin carriage salon.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
This is a rather interesting and unusual business.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Carriages for carriage riding are produced.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
They are produced in Poland, but the brand is Russian.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Sergey Pupynin is the descendant of the dynasty of manufacturers of these carriages for carriage riding.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:15.000
As an event promotion, this brand was chosen as a sponsor for the competition on carriage riding.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
In this case, this is one of the most obvious examples

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
when a brand already has an event with which it is closely related,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and the decision to promote it through event marketing is of course asked.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The example from the Caterpillar case is very simple.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
If it is a fashion show, then it is a fashion show,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and in this regard, the form has already been found.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
The question is how to make it more attractive and interesting.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Another way to promote a brand with benchmarking is to sit down with the event.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Sometimes there are some changes in society,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
or the expected holidays are coming,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
or some important events in political and cultural life are taking place.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
If the brand of this event does not have a clear right holder,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000
then you can tie your brand to it using a seasonal or other event conjuncture.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Many people do this, although this method of promotion is often associated with legal disputes.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000
As an example, I gave the corporate event of the company Megatron,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
which was called Megavidinia.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
This is a very large-scale event.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It was held in Turkey, where the staff was brought to the intensive care unit.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
The professional director, the event's director, worked there.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
You know by the name that Megavidinia is associated with Eurovision,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
but the first part of this word is associated with the company itself, with its name.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
The employees of the company presented themselves as real stars.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Special groups were created, like rock and pop groups,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000
which performed works associated with corporate history

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and the specific activity of the company Megatron.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
As an example, we can give the group Vulcan Strastei.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You know that Megatron is the owner of the casino Vulcan and the mountain halls.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
In this case, you can refer to the Internet source.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
There is a promotional site of this group, vulcanstrastei.narod.ru.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
A separate team was created, which could be used in other promotion programs,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
combining the internal and external marketing environment of the company.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
As an example of the case Caterpillar,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
you can bring a creative idea,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
tie the show of the new Caterpillar collection to the day of spring and labor.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
The task 7 will be a little longer than the previous one.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
It will take you about 20 minutes to complete it.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It sounds like this.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Use the listed types of standard creative benchmarking strategies

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
to create a concept of event promotion of your company's brand.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It is always difficult to switch from a textbook example to a real one.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
But we will remember that Caterpillar is also a real brand.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
If you can create some interesting creative ideas

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
based on benchmarking technology for your company,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
you can use this experience tomorrow.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Thank you.
