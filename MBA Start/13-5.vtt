00:00.000 --> 00:10.280
Hello, dear friends! My name is Elena Proskura. I represent the company Moscow Business School,

00:10.280 --> 00:15.040
I am an active business coach and consultant in the field of personnel management.

00:15.040 --> 00:20.280
Today's topic is called Corporate Culture and Change in the Company.

00:20.280 --> 00:24.560
What tasks will be solved during this course?

00:25.160 --> 00:30.920
First of all, we would like to talk about corporate culture,

00:30.920 --> 00:38.440
to show the importance of the culture of the organization as a factor that can contribute to changes or interfere with them.

00:38.440 --> 00:42.640
We want to introduce you to the best practices of modern organizations

00:42.640 --> 00:47.400
that approach the reform, that is, the change of corporate culture,

00:47.400 --> 00:50.720
or individual subcultures or so-called microcultures.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.800
We want to present the experience of real projects,

00:52.800 --> 00:58.520
within which organizations reformed their culture and conducted an analysis of it,

00:58.520 --> 01:02.480
how it was done and what results they achieved.

01:02.480 --> 01:09.240
We want to introduce you to the tools that allow you to diagnose corporate culture,

01:09.240 --> 01:15.600
that is, from the analysis as it is to the further picture of the world or to the vision of how it will be,

01:15.600 --> 01:18.440
that is, to outline possible ways of its update.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.760
We want to show the role of political forces in the reform process,

01:21.760 --> 01:27.480
how political forces within the company influence the change of corporate culture,

01:27.480 --> 01:29.480
how they can contribute or interfere.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.480
Let's start with the corporate culture, its elements and functions.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.880
What is corporate culture?

01:40.880 --> 01:46.080
It is quite often said that it is corporate culture or organizational culture.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.720
Moreover, there are different approaches to understanding these two concepts.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.720
On the one hand, sometimes, speaking of corporate culture, it means organizational culture,

01:56.720 --> 02:02.320
and sometimes, under corporate culture, it means almost the same as organizational culture,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.320
only in relation to large corporations.

02:04.320 --> 02:10.720
Lately, more and more often, speaking of corporate culture, it means organizational culture.

02:11.360 --> 02:16.720
If we look deeper, including at dictionaries,

02:16.720 --> 02:25.080
the short encyclopedic dictionary of Bragaoza and Frona says that a corporation is a common name for many types of alliances

02:25.080 --> 02:30.080
that have an internal organization that unites members of alliances as one whole.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.080
It is a subject of rights and duties of a legal entity.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.440
The word culture in Vladimir Daly's dictionary means education, both moral and intellectual.

02:41.440 --> 02:47.440
The encyclopedia of sociology says that culture, from the Latin word for education,

02:47.440 --> 02:52.440
is a system of historical, developing and biological programs of human activity.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.440
I hope I did not confuse you.

02:54.440 --> 02:59.440
Let's get closer to what is happening now.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.440
What is corporate culture in the modern interpretation?

03:03.800 --> 03:08.800
Corporate culture is a system of material and spiritual values,

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
manifestations that interact with each other,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
that are inherent in a corporation,

03:14.800 --> 03:20.800
that reflect its individuality and self-perception in the social and material environment,

03:20.800 --> 03:26.800
that manifest in behavior, interaction, self-perception and the environment.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.160
Quite often, when talking about corporate culture,

03:32.160 --> 03:39.160
it is said that it is a collection of rules, standards of behavior and ideological postulates

03:39.160 --> 03:43.160
based on the style of cooperation between employees, within the company,

03:43.160 --> 03:47.160
with clients and external counteragents.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.160
Let's do a little exercise.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.520
It is a joke, but through it you will be able to understand

03:56.520 --> 04:01.520
what corporate culture is and what its elements are,

04:01.520 --> 04:03.520
what its multifacetedness is.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.520
You need a clean sheet of paper and a pen for this.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.520
Have you taken it?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.520
Are you ready?

04:13.520 --> 04:19.520
Please write one animal and three qualities that you like it for.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.880
Write quickly, without thinking.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.880
The first thing that comes to your mind.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.880
Have you finished?

04:35.880 --> 04:39.880
Now write the second animal that you like too,

04:39.880 --> 04:42.880
and three qualities that you like it for.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.880
Write quickly, without thinking.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.880
The first thing that comes to your mind.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.240
If you have the same animal and the same definitions in the adjective,

04:51.240 --> 04:53.240
you can do it, it is not forbidden.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.240
Have you finished?

04:56.240 --> 05:00.240
Now write the third animal and three qualities that you like it for.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.240
Write quickly, without thinking.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.240
The conditions of the game are the same.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.240
If you have the same animal and the same qualities,

05:07.240 --> 05:11.240
you can write the same as the different variations.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.240
Other qualities are also animals and vice versa.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
Have you finished?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
Now do you want to know what it is?

05:20.600 --> 05:24.600
The first animal is what you want to be seen by.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.600
The second animal is what you are seen by.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.600
And the third animal is what you really are,

05:31.600 --> 05:34.600
or your subjective perception of yourself.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.600
This test is a joke, it is not a psycho-diagnostic, it is invalid,

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
but in every joke there is a part of the truth.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.960
The same is true for corporate culture.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
In his book Corporate Religion,

05:46.960 --> 05:48.960
Jesper Kunde took the theory of Alfred Adler

05:48.960 --> 05:52.960
about the three-member perception of a person as a basis.

05:52.960 --> 05:58.960
He said that a company is perceived in three components as a person.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.960
The first component is the mission,

06:00.960 --> 06:03.960
how the company wants to be seen.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.960
The second component is the brand,

06:05.960 --> 06:07.960
how the company is seen.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.320
The third component is corporate religion,

06:11.320 --> 06:14.320
or the internal corporate culture of the company.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.320
The company as it is inside.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.320
What exists in it, what are the connections,

06:21.320 --> 06:23.320
what are the internal elements.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.320
In order to understand in general,

06:26.320 --> 06:29.320
we will talk about the components,

06:29.320 --> 06:32.320
about the elements of corporate culture.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
But before we move on,

06:34.320 --> 06:37.320
I want to say that in psychology there is a concept of congruence.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.680
One thing should correspond to another.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.680
That is, what we want to be seen

06:42.680 --> 06:44.680
should correspond to how we are seen

06:44.680 --> 06:46.680
and what we really are.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.680
If this does not happen,

06:48.680 --> 06:50.680
there is a kind of dissonance,

06:50.680 --> 06:52.680
there is no congruence.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.680
And the company is perceived

06:54.680 --> 06:56.680
not as a single whole, a single component.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.680
This directly affects the company's perception,

07:00.680 --> 07:02.680
its business results,

07:02.680 --> 07:04.680
and whether or not the consumer

07:04.680 --> 07:06.680
chooses the company.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
And this affects the employees

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
who come to the company,

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
and those who work in it.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.040
And this also affects the duration of the company's work.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.040
And this directly affects the changes.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.040
We'll talk about this a little later.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040
Some time ago,

07:25.040 --> 07:28.040
the Association of Managers conducted a study.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
According to this study,

07:30.040 --> 07:33.040
the influence of corporate culture on something was determined.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.040
So what does corporate culture affect first of all?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
I mean not just corporate culture,

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
but its presence.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
Because corporate culture is always there,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
even if it is not formalized.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
It is the conscious management of corporate culture

07:48.400 --> 07:51.400
and understanding of who we are.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.400
So, first of all,

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
corporate culture affects the provision

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
of a positive image of the company

07:58.400 --> 08:01.400
for the staff, shareholders and external audiences.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.400
When a company is perceived as a single whole,

08:04.760 --> 08:07.760
the image of the company is certainly increased

08:07.760 --> 08:09.760
in the eyes of the consumer,

08:09.760 --> 08:12.760
external agents and employees.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.760
And the degree of influence

08:14.760 --> 08:17.760
of a clearly formed corporate culture

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
and a consciously managed one

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
is quite high.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
It is high for the end result,

08:23.760 --> 08:25.760
for the business result.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.760
Next, what does corporate culture affect?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.760
It contributes to the achievement

08:33.120 --> 08:35.120
of the company's performance indicators.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
As I said,

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
employees choose a company

08:39.120 --> 08:41.120
and become loyal to it

08:41.120 --> 08:43.120
based on the corporate culture

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
that exists in the company.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.120
And the longer a person works in a company,

08:48.120 --> 08:50.120
the more effective he is.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.120
It is clear that more effective employees

08:53.120 --> 08:56.120
show and demonstrate much higher results

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
than those who come

08:58.120 --> 09:00.120
and most of the people

09:00.120 --> 09:02.120
are in the company.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.480
For example, they are in the adaptation stage.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.480
The next factor

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
that influences the corporate culture

09:09.480 --> 09:12.480
is that it contributes to the better motivation of the staff.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.480
The next one is one of the key factors

09:15.480 --> 09:18.480
in the strategy of the company's development.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
If our strategic goals are formed

09:20.480 --> 09:22.480
on the basis of the mission,

09:22.480 --> 09:24.480
and the mission is an integral part

09:24.480 --> 09:26.480
of the corporate culture,

09:26.480 --> 09:28.480
it is clear that we choose the strategy

09:28.480 --> 09:30.480
depending on our mission and values.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.840
The next factor

09:32.840 --> 09:34.840
that influences the corporate culture

09:34.840 --> 09:36.840
is that it contributes to the better performance

09:36.840 --> 09:38.840
of the business processes in the company.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.840
What is the corporate culture made of?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
What are its elements?

09:42.840 --> 09:45.840
The first one is the corporate mission declaration,

09:45.840 --> 09:47.840
corporate philosophy,

09:47.840 --> 09:49.840
corporate spirit,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.840
leadership style,

09:51.840 --> 09:53.840
corporate management,

09:53.840 --> 09:55.840
corporate management,

09:55.840 --> 09:57.840
corporate management,

09:57.840 --> 09:59.840
corporate management,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
corporate ethics,

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
corporate image and reputation,

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
human resources management,

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
which is also an element

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
of the corporate culture of the company,

10:10.200 --> 10:12.200
and quality control.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.200
How do we control the quality

10:14.200 --> 10:16.200
of our products, services,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
and goods?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
These are all the elements

10:20.200 --> 10:22.200
of the corporate culture.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
When we say that

10:24.200 --> 10:26.200
the corporate culture needs to be

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
realized, formalized,

10:28.560 --> 10:30.560
and managed properly,

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
we need to understand

10:32.560 --> 10:34.560
the functions of the company,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.560
what it carries.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.560
The main task is

10:38.560 --> 10:40.560
to create a common language.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.560
Often, the business owners

10:42.560 --> 10:44.560
and top managers

10:44.560 --> 10:46.560
use the term

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
of a single cognitive apparatus.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.560
They say that we need

10:50.560 --> 10:52.560
our employees to speak the same language,

10:52.560 --> 10:54.560
to live in the same plane,

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
in the same space.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.920
This is an objective reality.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
A huge number of mistakes

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
are made by the company,

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
including violations

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
of internal business communications,

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
as well as external business communications.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
That is why

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
the creation of a single

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
cognitive apparatus

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
or common language

11:16.920 --> 11:18.920
is becoming more and more important.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.920
The employees of the company

11:20.920 --> 11:22.920
understand each other

11:22.920 --> 11:24.920
practically without words,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
and they are divided into categories

11:27.280 --> 11:29.280
of business purpose.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.280
The next function

11:31.280 --> 11:33.280
of the corporate culture

11:33.280 --> 11:35.280
is to create a boundary

11:35.280 --> 11:37.280
and a criterion for the other.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.280
When we talk about the corporate culture,

11:39.280 --> 11:41.280
we mean the mission

11:41.280 --> 11:43.280
and values.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.280
The only conflict

11:45.280 --> 11:47.280
that is not resolved

11:47.280 --> 11:49.280
is the conflict

11:49.280 --> 11:51.280
at the value level.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.280
That is why

11:53.640 --> 11:55.640
companies are increasingly

11:55.640 --> 11:57.640
addressing the values

11:57.640 --> 11:59.640
of the corporate culture

11:59.640 --> 12:01.640
and are forming

12:01.640 --> 12:03.640
the so-called corporate competencies.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.640
What are the corporate competencies?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.640
These are the personal features

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
of people who correspond

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
to the values of the company.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.640
When a company is selected,

12:13.640 --> 12:15.640
it starts to say that this person is its own,

12:15.640 --> 12:17.640
and this person is someone else's.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
Not everyone can fit into the company,

12:19.640 --> 12:21.640
not everyone can be effective in the company,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
and not everyone can be a good employee.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
The understanding of the values

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and philosophies

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
of the company

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
and its basic postulates

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
leads to the fact

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that the company understands

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
who is its own, who is ours,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and who is someone else's.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
That is how

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
the corporate competencies are formed.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The next function of the corporate culture

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
is to motivate people

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
with values and to provide obedience.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.360
This is an important thing

12:52.360 --> 12:54.360
and it is also related

12:54.360 --> 12:56.360
to the ideology.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.360
Why is obedience important?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.360
Obedience to the staff

13:00.360 --> 13:02.360
and to the external consumers.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.360
The loyalty of the staff

13:04.360 --> 13:06.360
is important for the simple reason

13:06.360 --> 13:08.360
that a person becomes effective

13:08.360 --> 13:10.360
the second or third year of working in a company.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.360
The longer a person works,

13:12.360 --> 13:14.360
the more effective he is,

13:14.360 --> 13:16.360
because he knows the specifics,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.360
he knows the company,

13:18.720 --> 13:20.720
he knows the business goals.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.720
Of course, such employees

13:22.720 --> 13:24.720
are more effective and useful for the company.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.720
Moreover,

13:26.720 --> 13:28.720
if there is a process of change in the company,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.720
these employees are more loyal

13:30.720 --> 13:32.720
to the changes,

13:32.720 --> 13:34.720
because they live more

13:34.720 --> 13:36.720
with the interests of the company

13:36.720 --> 13:38.720
than only with their own.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.720
It is clear that

13:40.720 --> 13:42.720
it is difficult

13:42.720 --> 13:44.720
to expect

13:44.720 --> 13:46.720
that the employees

13:47.080 --> 13:49.080
will live only

13:49.080 --> 13:51.080
with the interests of the company.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.080
In order to do this,

13:53.080 --> 13:55.080
they need to be shareholders.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.080
However, if an employee is loyal

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
to the company,

13:59.080 --> 14:01.080
he reacts more flexibly

14:01.080 --> 14:03.080
to the changes that may occur

14:03.080 --> 14:05.080
and he adapts

14:05.080 --> 14:07.080
to these changes better.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.080
He is ready to adapt

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080
because the company is

14:11.080 --> 14:13.080
his value level.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.080
The next function

14:15.440 --> 14:17.440
is the distribution of power,

14:17.440 --> 14:19.440
authority and status.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.440
It is the distribution

14:21.440 --> 14:23.440
of authority and status

14:23.440 --> 14:25.440
of the corporate culture

14:25.440 --> 14:27.440
and the style of management

14:27.440 --> 14:29.440
and internal business communication.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
The next function

14:31.440 --> 14:33.440
is the determination of the norms

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
of behavior and relations.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
It is related to the corporate image

14:37.440 --> 14:39.440
and to the corporate management

14:39.440 --> 14:41.440
that tells

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
how the company

14:43.800 --> 14:45.800
is formed in business

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
and internal and external communication.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
The corporate standards

14:49.800 --> 14:51.800
are formed in various directions

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
and they are formalized

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
in the corporate code.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
We will talk about it later.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.800
Another function

14:59.800 --> 15:01.800
of the corporate culture

15:01.800 --> 15:03.800
is the formation of approaches

15:03.800 --> 15:05.800
to the work.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
How do we do it?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.800
What do we do?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.800
What don't we do?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.160
Now we will talk about

15:14.160 --> 15:16.160
each of the elements

15:16.160 --> 15:18.160
and the basic elements

15:18.160 --> 15:20.160
of the corporate culture.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.160
The important element

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
of the corporate culture

15:24.160 --> 15:26.160
is the corporate spirit.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.160
It is often said

15:28.160 --> 15:30.160
that there is a corporate spirit

15:30.160 --> 15:32.160
in our company.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.160
It is often said

15:34.160 --> 15:36.160
that there is a microclimate

15:36.160 --> 15:38.160
in our company.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.160
What is the corporate spirit?

15:40.520 --> 15:42.520
The corporate spirit

15:42.520 --> 15:44.520
is defined as the following.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.520
The corporate spirit

15:46.520 --> 15:48.520
is the emotional and spiritual connections

15:48.520 --> 15:50.520
that are formed

15:50.520 --> 15:52.520
between the members of the team

15:52.520 --> 15:54.520
and they are formed

15:54.520 --> 15:56.520
around the mission

15:56.520 --> 15:58.520
and vision of the company.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.520
The psycho-emotional connections

16:00.520 --> 16:02.520
that are formed

16:02.520 --> 16:04.520
inside the company

16:04.520 --> 16:06.520
and the informal relations

16:06.520 --> 16:08.520
are the corporate spirit.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
Let's take a picture.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.880
There are two employees

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
and in the distance

16:14.880 --> 16:16.880
they are crawling

16:16.880 --> 16:18.880
into something small

16:18.880 --> 16:20.880
and not very visible.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
One of them asks

16:22.880 --> 16:24.880
who is that?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.880
The other one answers

16:26.880 --> 16:28.880
that it is our corporate spirit.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.880
The corporate spirit

16:30.880 --> 16:32.880
is something that is always there

16:32.880 --> 16:34.880
but it is not always possible

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
to feel it.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.240
It is something

16:39.240 --> 16:41.240
that the team is often united around.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.240
People stay in the company

16:43.240 --> 16:45.240
thanks to the microclimate

16:45.240 --> 16:47.240
that is formed in the team

16:47.240 --> 16:49.240
and choose it

16:49.240 --> 16:51.240
for a long-term work.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.240
Another element of the corporate culture

16:55.240 --> 16:57.240
is the corporate ethics.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.240
The Latin word for it

16:59.240 --> 17:01.240
means the custom and character.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.240
It is a system

17:03.240 --> 17:05.240
of behavior norms

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
that is based on the ethics

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
of the employees

17:09.600 --> 17:11.600
and the environment.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.600
The standards of the corporate ethics

17:13.600 --> 17:15.600
are implemented

17:15.600 --> 17:17.600
through the ethical rules

17:17.600 --> 17:19.600
and the business communication standards.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
The companies

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
do not have

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
the same corporate standards.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.600
The companies usually take

17:27.600 --> 17:29.600
the basic standards

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
of the ethics

17:31.600 --> 17:33.600
and the rest

17:33.960 --> 17:35.960
of the values

17:35.960 --> 17:37.960
that the company has.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.960
What are the basic rules

17:41.960 --> 17:43.960
of the ethics?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.960
It is the need to keep promises.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.960
Most people

17:47.960 --> 17:49.960
would like to have a guarantee

17:49.960 --> 17:51.960
that the promises

17:51.960 --> 17:53.960
that are given

17:53.960 --> 17:55.960
will be fulfilled.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.960
But it is not only

17:57.960 --> 17:59.960
the employees

17:59.960 --> 18:01.960
or external agents

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
that are involved in the process.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.320
It is also the consumer

18:06.320 --> 18:08.320
of the company

18:08.320 --> 18:10.320
that is involved

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
in the process.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.320
It is the consumer, the seller,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.320
the buyer.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.320
Recently

18:18.320 --> 18:20.320
I have heard

18:20.320 --> 18:22.320
the definition

18:22.320 --> 18:24.320
of the corporate competencies

18:24.320 --> 18:26.320
of the companies

18:26.320 --> 18:28.320
as follows.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
The company has the obligation

18:30.680 --> 18:32.680
to be responsible.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.680
What does it mean?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.680
It means

18:36.680 --> 18:38.680
the ability

18:38.680 --> 18:40.680
to keep promises,

18:40.680 --> 18:42.680
to fulfill the promises

18:42.680 --> 18:44.680
given

18:44.680 --> 18:46.680
to the other party.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.680
The owners often say

18:48.680 --> 18:50.680
not only about the obligation

18:50.680 --> 18:52.680
to fulfill the promises

18:52.680 --> 18:54.680
to the external agents,

18:54.680 --> 18:56.680
partners,

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
consumers,

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
but also about the employees.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.040
In this picture of the world

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
they say

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
that it is important

19:07.040 --> 19:09.040
to fulfill the promises

19:09.040 --> 19:11.040
not only to the employer

19:11.040 --> 19:13.040
but also to the employee

19:13.040 --> 19:15.040
before the employer.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
It is a road with a bilateral movement.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.040
It is a tendency

19:19.040 --> 19:21.040
to have a team style

19:21.040 --> 19:23.040
of interaction.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
More and more companies

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
talk about a team style

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
of cooperation.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.400
The first ethical rule

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
is the cooperation.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
Every person

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
who joins a social group

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
expects to receive help

19:39.400 --> 19:41.400
from other members

19:41.400 --> 19:43.400
when they need it.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
It is also a team style

19:45.400 --> 19:47.400
of cooperation.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.400
The next rule

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
is the respect for the property.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
Not only for the property,

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
but also for the intellectual property.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.760
Each of us

19:57.760 --> 19:59.760
has a certain knowledge

19:59.760 --> 20:01.760
which we leave

20:01.760 --> 20:03.760
in the company

20:03.760 --> 20:05.760
when we join it.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.760
We have to leave it

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
because the company pays us

20:09.760 --> 20:11.760
money or a bonus.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
It is very important

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
that the company

20:15.760 --> 20:17.760
appreciates it

20:17.760 --> 20:19.760
on one hand

20:19.760 --> 20:21.760
and on the other hand

20:21.760 --> 20:23.760
the employee is ready

20:24.120 --> 20:26.120
to share it with us.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.120
When there is respect

20:28.120 --> 20:30.120
on both sides

20:30.120 --> 20:32.120
the company

20:32.120 --> 20:34.120
is enriched

20:34.120 --> 20:36.120
with the knowledge

20:36.120 --> 20:38.120
of its employees.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.120
It affects

20:40.120 --> 20:42.120
the company's efficiency.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.120
I would like to talk

20:46.120 --> 20:48.120
about the tools

20:48.120 --> 20:50.120
which form

20:50.120 --> 20:52.120
the company's personality.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
We create

20:54.480 --> 20:56.480
an image of the company.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.480
There is a corporate culture

20:58.480 --> 21:00.480
called corporate image.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.480
We create it

21:02.480 --> 21:04.480
through various components

21:04.480 --> 21:06.480
such as the interior,

21:06.480 --> 21:08.480
our employees,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.480
their appearance,

21:10.480 --> 21:12.480
the way they answer the phone,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.480
the phone call,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.480
exhibitions, brochures,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.480
advertising,

21:18.480 --> 21:20.480
corporate events.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
There are also

21:22.840 --> 21:24.840
certain tools and ways

21:24.840 --> 21:26.840
of positioning.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.840
A common tool

21:28.840 --> 21:30.840
which is used by a lot of companies

21:30.840 --> 21:32.840
is the corporate code.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.840
Another tool

21:34.840 --> 21:36.840
is the corporate information system.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
It is a variety

21:38.840 --> 21:40.840
of so-called internal PR.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.840
These are internal publications

21:42.840 --> 21:44.840
such as newspapers,

21:44.840 --> 21:46.840
magazines, bulletins.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.840
More and more companies

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
use audiovisual media

21:51.200 --> 21:53.200
such as radio, television,

21:53.200 --> 21:55.200
and video clips.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
There are also traditional ways

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
such as the advertising board,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.200
the information board,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
and so on.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
Another interesting tool

22:07.200 --> 22:09.200
is the hotline

22:09.200 --> 22:11.200
between the company's manager

22:11.200 --> 22:13.200
and the employees.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.200
Sometimes it is called

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
the voice booth

22:17.560 --> 22:19.560
where the employees

22:19.560 --> 22:21.560
share their wishes,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.560
their discontent,

22:23.560 --> 22:25.560
doubts, questions.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.560
It is a channel

22:27.560 --> 22:29.560
of informal communication.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.560
There are also

22:31.560 --> 22:33.560
some events

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
such as

22:35.560 --> 22:37.560
informational and explanatory

22:37.560 --> 22:39.560
events

22:39.560 --> 22:41.560
by the company.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.560
For example,

22:43.560 --> 22:45.560
presentations,

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
rumors are also

22:47.920 --> 22:49.920
a tool

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
to create a company's personality.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.920
However, it is a tool

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
that needs to be managed.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.920
Another way

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
to create a company's personality

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
is traditions

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
and symbols.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
We have already talked

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
about the corporate culture

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
and its components.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
Now let's imagine

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
a situation

23:14.280 --> 23:16.280
when you are

23:16.280 --> 23:18.280
the initiator

23:18.280 --> 23:20.280
of the company's changes.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.280
For example,

23:22.280 --> 23:24.280
you are the project

23:24.280 --> 23:26.280
that you need to implement.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.280
Sometimes we think

23:28.280 --> 23:30.280
that we are implementing a project

23:30.280 --> 23:32.280
and everything will be great

23:32.280 --> 23:34.280
and it will work.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.280
Very often we do not take into account

23:36.280 --> 23:38.280
certain nuances,

23:38.280 --> 23:40.280
the company's readiness,

23:40.280 --> 23:42.280
its features,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.640
and the corporate culture.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
How much will the corporate culture

23:46.640 --> 23:48.640
help with these changes

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
and how much will it prevent

23:50.640 --> 23:52.640
these changes from happening?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.640
As far as I know,

23:54.640 --> 23:56.640
many of you are already

23:56.640 --> 23:58.640
well-trained

23:58.640 --> 24:00.640
and know that any change

24:00.640 --> 24:02.640
causes resistance.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.640
It is a normal, live reaction

24:04.640 --> 24:06.640
of the body.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.640
But we can also calculate

24:08.640 --> 24:10.640
possible risks

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and use tools

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
that will reduce

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
the resistance.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Then your project

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
will be implemented

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
much faster and more effectively.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Where do we start?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
We start with an audit.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Everything always starts

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
with a study of the situation.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Sometimes we do it unconsciously.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
When we join a new company,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.360
we start studying something.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.360
As a consultant,

24:43.360 --> 24:45.360
when I join a company,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.360
most of the projects start with a diagnosis

24:47.360 --> 24:49.360
and understanding of the current state of affairs.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.360
When it comes to preparing

24:51.360 --> 24:53.360
a project,

24:53.360 --> 24:55.360
we also have to start

24:55.360 --> 24:57.360
before planning and scheduling

24:57.360 --> 24:59.360
the project.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.360
We have to understand what we have.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.360
How to conduct an audit?

25:09.360 --> 25:11.360
You can do it on your own

25:11.360 --> 25:13.360
or you can invite

25:13.360 --> 25:15.360
specialists from outside.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.360
If they come from outside,

25:17.360 --> 25:19.360
they know what tools to use.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.360
If you do it on your own,

25:21.360 --> 25:23.360
you can use

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
traditional audits.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
You can develop the audit

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
on your own.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.360
Your task at this stage is to understand

25:31.360 --> 25:33.360
what you have here now.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.360
How it is now.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.360
How does a corporate culture look like?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
It is often said

25:39.720 --> 25:41.720
that corporate culture is as it is.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.720
The audit of a corporate culture

25:43.720 --> 25:45.720
is as it is.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.720
I would like to inform you

25:47.720 --> 25:49.720
about how to conduct an audit

25:49.720 --> 25:51.720
or how to choose consultants

25:51.720 --> 25:53.720
if you decide

25:53.720 --> 25:55.720
that a consultant is conducting an audit.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.720
It is very important

25:57.720 --> 25:59.720
that you choose a consultant

25:59.720 --> 26:01.720
who is a good fit for you.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.720
You should choose a consultant

26:03.720 --> 26:05.720
who is a good fit for you.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
It is very important

26:08.080 --> 26:10.080
that the incoming consultants

26:10.080 --> 26:12.080
understand that corporate culture

26:12.080 --> 26:14.080
is an important component

26:14.080 --> 26:16.080
of the company.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.080
You should take the choice of consultants

26:18.080 --> 26:20.080
as well as the choice of any

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
external provider

26:22.080 --> 26:24.080
quite seriously.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
It is important to form the requirements

26:26.080 --> 26:28.080
on the basis of which

26:28.080 --> 26:30.080
you will choose consultants

26:30.080 --> 26:32.080
and evaluate them

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
so that they come

26:34.440 --> 26:36.440
and give you the desired result.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.440
It is the same as

26:38.440 --> 26:40.440
a doctor or a psychologist.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.440
The main command is

26:42.440 --> 26:44.440
not to harm.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.440
If the consultants

26:46.440 --> 26:48.440
start to wave their swords

26:48.440 --> 26:50.440
and say that

26:50.440 --> 26:52.440
you should break this

26:52.440 --> 26:54.440
and that it is disturbing,

26:54.440 --> 26:56.440
you should not take

26:56.440 --> 26:58.440
such consultants

26:58.440 --> 27:00.440
because corporate culture

27:00.440 --> 27:02.440
does not change in one hour.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.800
Corporate culture

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
is not just some postulates

27:06.800 --> 27:08.800
and formalized elements.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.800
As I said,

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
it is people's values,

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
the behavior models

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
that they choose

27:16.800 --> 27:18.800
based on these values,

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
the emotional reactions

27:20.800 --> 27:22.800
that they have

27:22.800 --> 27:24.800
within these behavior models.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.800
It is a question of personal

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
and individuality of a group of people.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
A group of people

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
with certain values,

27:33.160 --> 27:35.160
behavior models,

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
emotional reactions.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.160
We recall the corporate spirit

27:39.160 --> 27:41.160
and the emotional connections.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
If you break them

27:43.160 --> 27:45.160
and do it unthinkingly,

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
it is very painful

27:47.160 --> 27:49.160
and you will be cut alive.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.160
Therefore,

27:51.160 --> 27:53.160
treat the choice of consultants

27:53.160 --> 27:55.160
very wisely, consciously

27:55.160 --> 27:57.160
and purposefully.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.160
Spend some time on it.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.520
Do not make a decision

28:01.520 --> 28:03.520
in a jiffy

28:03.520 --> 28:05.520
because the result

28:05.520 --> 28:07.520
can be deplorable.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.520
Your task is

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
to achieve

28:11.520 --> 28:13.520
your result

28:13.520 --> 28:15.520
and to do it effectively.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.520
I would like to give an example

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
of a company.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
How did

28:25.520 --> 28:27.520
the change

28:27.880 --> 28:29.880
in the corporate culture

28:29.880 --> 28:31.880
happen?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.880
A while ago

28:33.880 --> 28:35.880
a company called

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
Hair Consulting

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
was put in the center

28:39.880 --> 28:41.880
of a paradigm,

28:41.880 --> 28:43.880
a value level.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.880
The company realized

28:45.880 --> 28:47.880
what it is now.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.880
It is a company of individualists,

28:49.880 --> 28:51.880
a company that makes

28:51.880 --> 28:53.880
continuous changes

28:53.880 --> 28:55.880
and a company that performs

28:56.240 --> 28:58.240
the tasks.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.240
The components

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
of the corporate culture

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
were formed around this paradigm.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.240
The analysis was made

29:06.240 --> 29:08.240
based on them.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
These are symbols,

29:10.240 --> 29:12.240
power,

29:12.240 --> 29:14.240
organization,

29:14.240 --> 29:16.240
rituals, routine,

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
legends and control.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
This is how the game is implemented.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.240
The analysis was made

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
based on these components.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
What do we have now?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.600
If our values are individualism

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
and autonomy,

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
then the symbol

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
of this value

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
was the need to look busy

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
or creative disorder.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
This is what

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
was reflected

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
in the surveyors.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
Then the company formed

29:48.600 --> 29:50.600
its approaches,

29:50.600 --> 29:52.600
what we want to be,

29:52.960 --> 29:54.960
what we are and what we need.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
What do we want to achieve?

29:56.960 --> 29:58.960
Within the framework of what we need

29:58.960 --> 30:00.960
the paradigm of focus on the client

30:00.960 --> 30:02.960
appeared.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.960
Then the components

30:04.960 --> 30:06.960
around the paradigm

30:06.960 --> 30:08.960
began to change.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
In particular, the symbols

30:10.960 --> 30:12.960
became informal interaction.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
The creative order

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
became an element

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
of the corporate culture.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.960
The company

30:21.320 --> 30:23.320
was just the beginning

30:23.320 --> 30:25.320
of the way.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.320
We understand

30:27.320 --> 30:29.320
how it is,

30:29.320 --> 30:31.320
we draw the picture as it should be,

30:31.320 --> 30:33.320
but after that we must understand

30:33.320 --> 30:35.320
what we will do,

30:35.320 --> 30:37.320
which ways we will go to the right place,

30:37.320 --> 30:39.320
which steps we will take,

30:39.320 --> 30:41.320
which programs to implement.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.320
In fact,

30:43.320 --> 30:45.320
in this situation

30:45.320 --> 30:47.320
a huge number of companies

30:47.320 --> 30:49.320
face

30:49.680 --> 30:51.680
changes.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.680
These changes can be diverse.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.680
It can be a process of merging and absorbing,

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
it can be rebranding,

30:57.680 --> 30:59.680
it can be a change

30:59.680 --> 31:01.680
of the manager,

31:01.680 --> 31:03.680
it can be

31:03.680 --> 31:05.680
a change of the top manager team.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.680
But most often it is a process

31:07.680 --> 31:09.680
of merging and absorbing,

31:09.680 --> 31:11.680
rebranding,

31:11.680 --> 31:13.680
and in the situation when the company

31:13.680 --> 31:15.680
reaches a new quality level

31:15.680 --> 31:17.680
in some markets, including international.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.040
It is a very interesting experience

31:20.040 --> 31:22.040
of the company

31:22.040 --> 31:24.040
TNK BP,

31:24.040 --> 31:26.040
when the Russian company merged

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
with the Western company.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.040
In order to understand

31:32.040 --> 31:34.040
what the corporate culture will be,

31:34.040 --> 31:36.040
the image of the

31:36.040 --> 31:38.040
single corporate culture was formed.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.040
It is clear that there were many nuances.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.040
On the one hand,

31:42.040 --> 31:44.040
the corporate culture of TNK

31:44.040 --> 31:46.040
was very different from the pro-Western style

31:46.400 --> 31:48.400
of work and interaction

31:48.400 --> 31:50.400
in the BP company.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
Moreover,

31:52.400 --> 31:54.400
there was a language barrier.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
The single-pronoun apparatus

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
was complicated

32:00.400 --> 32:02.400
by the fact that people

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
spoke different languages.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
TNK BP

32:06.400 --> 32:08.400
developed a huge number of programs

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
in order to

32:10.400 --> 32:12.400
come to the new

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
corporate culture

32:14.760 --> 32:16.760
that was formed

32:16.760 --> 32:18.760
at the stage of merging and absorbing.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.760
The company understood

32:20.760 --> 32:22.760
that there is a corporate culture

32:22.760 --> 32:24.760
of TNK,

32:24.760 --> 32:26.760
and there is a corporate culture of BP.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.760
And what kind of corporate culture

32:28.760 --> 32:30.760
we want to get.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.760
In the process of merging and absorbing

32:32.760 --> 32:34.760
there can be different interesting

32:34.760 --> 32:36.760
results.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.760
On the one hand,

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
a stronger corporate culture

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
can eat a weaker corporate culture.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.120
On the other hand,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.120
a new corporate culture

32:47.120 --> 32:49.120
can be created

32:49.120 --> 32:51.120
and the best

32:51.120 --> 32:53.120
of the two companies

32:53.120 --> 32:55.120
can be taken from the corporate culture

32:55.120 --> 32:57.120
of the other company.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.120
And a portrait of the company

32:59.120 --> 33:01.120
can be created.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.120
All the programs

33:03.120 --> 33:05.120
that are planned

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
help to change

33:07.120 --> 33:09.120
the corporate culture

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
of the company.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.480
For example,

33:13.480 --> 33:15.480
if the company

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
lived in a conservative environment,

33:17.480 --> 33:19.480
the main postulate

33:19.480 --> 33:21.480
in the management style

33:21.480 --> 33:23.480
was an authoritarian style

33:23.480 --> 33:25.480
and a unilateral decision-making.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.480
And the company

33:27.480 --> 33:29.480
starts to make changes

33:29.480 --> 33:31.480
and understands

33:31.480 --> 33:33.480
that it hinders the company's development.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.480
It starts to change

33:35.480 --> 33:37.480
certain aspects of its approach.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.480
In particular,

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
it helps to implement

33:41.840 --> 33:43.840
new modern tools,

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
trends, approaches,

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
motivation of the staff,

33:47.840 --> 33:49.840
interaction, decision-making.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.840
If a decision is made

33:51.840 --> 33:53.840
that we need to change

33:53.840 --> 33:55.840
the corporate management style

33:55.840 --> 33:57.840
and the management style

33:57.840 --> 33:59.840
of people

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
to a more democratic plane,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
it is clear that

34:03.840 --> 34:05.840
the changes will not happen at once.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.840
Because the choice of the management style

34:08.200 --> 34:10.200
is a personal choice

34:10.200 --> 34:12.200
of the people

34:12.200 --> 34:14.200
who choose it.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.200
On the other hand,

34:16.200 --> 34:18.200
it is a norm

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
that we are used to live in.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.200
It is hard to imagine

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
that a person who interacted

34:24.200 --> 34:26.200
with a strict superordination

34:26.200 --> 34:28.200
will interact

34:28.200 --> 34:30.200
with a democratic one

34:30.200 --> 34:32.200
tomorrow.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.200
That is why

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
a number of measures

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
and projects

34:38.560 --> 34:40.560
are needed

34:40.560 --> 34:42.560
to make changes

34:42.560 --> 34:44.560
in people

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
who are used

34:46.560 --> 34:48.560
to interact

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
within the existing corporate culture.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
Let's go back to the situation

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
when you are the initiator

34:56.560 --> 34:58.560
and you need to make an audit

34:58.560 --> 35:00.560
to understand

35:00.560 --> 35:02.560
the corporate culture.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.560
You decided to develop

35:04.920 --> 35:06.920
a project independently.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.920
How should it look like?

35:08.920 --> 35:10.920
It is a field of fantasy.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.920
It is important to remember

35:12.920 --> 35:14.920
that we ask any question

35:14.920 --> 35:16.920
with a goal

35:16.920 --> 35:18.920
to get a result.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
When you are forming this audit,

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
base on these postulates.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.920
We form every question

35:24.920 --> 35:26.920
with a goal

35:26.920 --> 35:28.920
and we want

35:28.920 --> 35:30.920
to get a result.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.920
Then there will be no extra questions

35:33.280 --> 35:35.280
but the questions

35:35.280 --> 35:37.280
should cover

35:37.280 --> 35:39.280
the whole corporate culture.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.280
For example,

35:41.280 --> 35:43.280
you can form questions

35:43.280 --> 35:45.280
about your company's reputation

35:45.280 --> 35:47.280
as an employer,

35:47.280 --> 35:49.280
how the company is perceived

35:49.280 --> 35:51.280
as an attractive employer

35:51.280 --> 35:53.280
and not only

35:53.280 --> 35:55.280
by the employees

35:55.280 --> 35:57.280
who have been working for a long time

35:57.280 --> 35:59.280
but by all the employees

35:59.280 --> 36:01.280
including the new employees.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.640
You can ask questions

36:03.640 --> 36:05.640
about how your attitude

36:05.640 --> 36:07.640
to the company has changed

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
before the company was created,

36:09.640 --> 36:11.640
during the adaptation period,

36:11.640 --> 36:13.640
during the working process

36:13.640 --> 36:15.640
and after 2-3 years

36:15.640 --> 36:17.640
if you have enough employees.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
The next thing

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
that should be audited

36:23.640 --> 36:25.640
is the management style.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.640
What is the management style?

36:27.640 --> 36:29.640
There are many things

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
that are connected to this.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
The decision-making,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
the communication,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
the business communication

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
inside the company,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
the planning,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
the motivation system

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
depend on the management style

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
chosen by the company.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
The independence

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
in the decision-making

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
is also a component

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
of the management style

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
as well as the level of trust.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.360
It is based on the management

37:00.360 --> 37:02.360
of the people

37:02.360 --> 37:04.360
and the managerial competencies.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.360
You should also diagnose

37:10.360 --> 37:12.360
the innovation.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.360
How innovative the company is,

37:14.360 --> 37:16.360
how much the employees

37:16.360 --> 37:18.360
are used to living in the innovation,

37:18.360 --> 37:20.360
how much they are ready for changes,

37:20.360 --> 37:22.360
for the risk and so on.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.360
Another important factor

37:24.360 --> 37:26.360
is to determine

37:26.720 --> 37:28.720
how loyal the employees are

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
to the company,

37:30.720 --> 37:32.720
how much they identify with the company,

37:32.720 --> 37:34.720
how much they value

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
within the company

37:36.720 --> 37:38.720
and whether they think

37:38.720 --> 37:40.720
in the categories of business purpose.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.720
I call it the motive at the level of the idea.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.720
It is when any initiative,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.720
any action,

37:46.720 --> 37:48.720
any innovation

37:48.720 --> 37:50.720
is first of all measured

37:50.720 --> 37:52.720
on the business purpose,

37:52.720 --> 37:54.720
on the final business result.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
It is important to take a look

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
at the workbook,

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
to see Harrison's survey

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
and to make an analysis

38:03.080 --> 38:05.080
of the corporate culture

38:05.080 --> 38:07.080
based on this survey.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
What happens

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
in the situation of implementation

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
of changes

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
when we do not manage

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
to follow the changes?

38:33.440 --> 38:35.440
Let's take a business process

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
according to the scheme.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
The employees have a feeling

38:39.440 --> 38:41.440
that there is stability.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.440
They have stability.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
Most of the employees.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.440
The management of the company

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
believes that the company

38:49.440 --> 38:51.440
needs to be brought to a new level.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
In fact, the changes are

38:53.800 --> 38:55.800
even the implementation

38:55.800 --> 38:57.800
of corporate standards.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
The company has been living

38:59.800 --> 39:01.800
without the standards of the external view

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
and the standards of telecommunications.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.800
Tomorrow or in a week

39:07.800 --> 39:09.800
or sometime later

39:09.800 --> 39:11.800
the company introduces.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.800
The staff perceives it

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
as a restriction of their freedom.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.800
I repeat,

39:17.800 --> 39:19.800
the normal reaction of the body

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
is a change.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.160
We do not have any programs

39:24.160 --> 39:26.160
that would accompany

39:26.160 --> 39:28.160
these changes

39:28.160 --> 39:30.160
and contribute to the reduction

39:30.160 --> 39:32.160
of resistance.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.160
What happens?

39:34.160 --> 39:36.160
Stability, the feeling of the staff

39:36.160 --> 39:38.160
and the beginning of changes.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.160
Then the resistance begins.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.160
You continue to introduce changes.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.160
The resistance is intensified.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.160
Either in an open form,

39:46.160 --> 39:48.160
an open conflict,

39:48.520 --> 39:50.520
or in a hidden form,

39:50.520 --> 39:52.520
a hidden sabotage.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.520
What do you do next?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.520
You start to fight

39:56.520 --> 39:58.520
with these resistances.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.520
They do it in different ways.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.520
Sometimes they use administrative resources,

40:02.520 --> 40:04.520
administrative measures.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.520
Sometimes they try to clarify.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.520
But if your company

40:08.520 --> 40:10.520
is inclined to an authoritarian style of management,

40:10.520 --> 40:12.520
then most likely the clarification

40:12.520 --> 40:14.520
will have a declarative nature.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.520
It will look like

40:16.880 --> 40:18.880
you force your staff to be happy.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.880
They do not understand

40:20.880 --> 40:22.880
why they have to do this.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.880
They do not understand

40:24.880 --> 40:26.880
what is happening.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.880
Then there is

40:28.880 --> 40:30.880
either an exit from the change

40:30.880 --> 40:32.880
or the changes continue

40:32.880 --> 40:34.880
and you try to resist.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.880
What happens next?

40:36.880 --> 40:38.880
There is a destruction

40:38.880 --> 40:40.880
of a certain authenticity.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.880
When you have already

40:42.880 --> 40:44.880
come out of these changes,

40:45.240 --> 40:47.240
you can no longer live

40:47.240 --> 40:49.240
authentically as before.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.240
You can't live in a new way.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.240
You can't do it, you don't want to.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.240
Your staff is demotivated.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
Then there is

40:57.240 --> 40:59.240
a long process

40:59.240 --> 41:01.240
when you return to stability.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.240
Why do people resist changes?

41:05.240 --> 41:07.240
Because

41:07.240 --> 41:09.240
we are inclined

41:09.240 --> 41:11.240
to stability.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.240
The second step of the pyramid

41:13.600 --> 41:15.600
is the need for safety.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.600
For us, stability is a feeling of safety.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.600
It is a physiological need.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.600
We strive

41:21.600 --> 41:23.600
to surround and create

41:23.600 --> 41:25.600
a feeling of safety.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.600
If there are changes

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
without accompaniment,

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
without information,

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
we resist.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.600
But when we do not receive information,

41:35.600 --> 41:37.600
what do we do?

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
We think it over.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.600
We think it over

41:41.960 --> 41:43.960
and we are more likely

41:43.960 --> 41:45.960
to be disappointed.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.960
We expect negative changes

41:47.960 --> 41:49.960
rather than positive ones.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.960
This is a social and cultural feature

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
of our country.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.960
The changes in our country

41:55.960 --> 41:57.960
were usually

41:57.960 --> 41:59.960
very encouraging

41:59.960 --> 42:01.960
and negative.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.960
We are all from the past life,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.960
from historical experience,

42:05.960 --> 42:07.960
from our own experience.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
We always expect something bad.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
We always

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
evaluate changes

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
in the situation

42:16.320 --> 42:18.320
that will bring

42:18.320 --> 42:20.320
positive changes

42:20.320 --> 42:22.320
to me.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
Every time we combine

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
our goals and motives

42:26.320 --> 42:28.320
with the changes

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
that are happening.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
There are changes in goals,

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
motives, values.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.320
And every time a person evaluates

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
the changes that will come

42:38.680 --> 42:40.680
and contribute

42:40.680 --> 42:42.680
to his goals.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.680
And how much

42:44.680 --> 42:46.680
the goals that will be within the company

42:46.680 --> 42:48.680
correspond to his goals, motives,

42:48.680 --> 42:50.680
values.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.680
If he does not receive information,

42:52.680 --> 42:54.680
he begins to resist it.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.680
Because it is a threat

42:56.680 --> 42:58.680
to his safety,

42:58.680 --> 43:00.680
his personality

43:00.680 --> 43:02.680
and values.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.680
A person perceives it this way.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.680
Now let's look at the situation

43:07.040 --> 43:09.040
where the company culture

43:09.040 --> 43:11.040
is being accompanied.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.040
The situation again.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
The feeling of stability

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
of the staff.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.040
Then preparation

43:19.040 --> 43:21.040
for the changes begins.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.040
It begins with an analysis

43:23.040 --> 43:25.040
of the existing corporate culture.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.040
Including understanding

43:27.040 --> 43:29.040
how much the corporate culture

43:29.040 --> 43:31.040
will contribute, help with the changes.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.040
How much it will interfere with these changes.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
Then the vision is formed

43:35.400 --> 43:37.400
or the corporate culture

43:37.400 --> 43:39.400
that we want to come to.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.400
In all its components.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.400
And,

43:43.400 --> 43:45.400
based on this,

43:45.400 --> 43:47.400
certain approaches are formed

43:47.400 --> 43:49.400
in terms of how to motivate the staff.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
How to form

43:51.400 --> 43:53.400
the staff's

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
commitment to the changes.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.400
How to involve the staff

43:57.400 --> 43:59.400
in the process of change.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
What to do

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
so that people

44:03.760 --> 44:05.760
participate in these changes.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.760
So that they accept them

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
and, most importantly,

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
do not resist these changes.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.760
In fact,

44:13.760 --> 44:15.760
the search begins

44:15.760 --> 44:17.760
in the process of adaptation.

44:17.760 --> 44:19.760
The adaptation of people

44:19.760 --> 44:21.760
to the changes

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
of the corporate culture.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.760
Sometimes,

44:25.760 --> 44:27.760
in the situation of changes,

44:27.760 --> 44:29.760
including at the stage of preparation,

44:29.760 --> 44:31.760
the agents of changes are determined.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.120
A model of competence

44:34.120 --> 44:36.120
for these agents of changes is formed.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.120
These people are identified

44:38.120 --> 44:40.120
who will help the management,

44:40.120 --> 44:42.120
help the company

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
implement these changes.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.120
They can be informal leaders.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.120
They can be formal leaders,

44:48.120 --> 44:50.120
that is, the existing managers of the management link.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.120
And they actively

44:52.120 --> 44:54.120
draft and implement

44:54.120 --> 44:56.120
in addition to the existing programs

44:56.120 --> 44:58.120
in the company

44:58.120 --> 45:00.120
some new standards

45:00.480 --> 45:02.480
of behavior, interaction

45:02.480 --> 45:04.480
that will occur

45:04.480 --> 45:06.480
as a result of the changes

45:06.480 --> 45:08.480
that will be present in the company.

45:08.480 --> 45:10.480
Actually,

45:10.480 --> 45:12.480
this path can take

45:12.480 --> 45:14.480
quite a long time.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.480
In particular, the same company,

45:16.480 --> 45:18.480
TNK-BP,

45:18.480 --> 45:20.480
has been implementing the process

45:20.480 --> 45:22.480
of changing the corporate culture for four years.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.480
And in the next three or four years,

45:24.480 --> 45:26.480
they are planning programs

45:26.480 --> 45:28.480
for the improvement of the corporate culture.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.840
The process is quite long.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.840
What happens next?

45:32.840 --> 45:34.840
The adoption of these new values

45:34.840 --> 45:36.840
or identification

45:36.840 --> 45:38.840
with the new corporate culture

45:38.840 --> 45:40.840
takes place.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.840
People begin to see themselves

45:42.840 --> 45:44.840
within this corporate culture.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.840
Not just see,

45:46.840 --> 45:48.840
but their behavior,

45:48.840 --> 45:50.840
interaction,

45:50.840 --> 45:52.840
adaptation to new standards,

45:52.840 --> 45:54.840
to a new style,

45:54.840 --> 45:56.840
to a new culture.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.200
In particular,

45:59.200 --> 46:01.200
if we talk about the changes

46:01.200 --> 46:03.200
in the system of values

46:03.200 --> 46:05.200
and coordinates

46:05.200 --> 46:07.200
in the field of human management,

46:07.200 --> 46:09.200
if we move from the declarative style

46:09.200 --> 46:11.200
of management, from authoritarian to democratic,

46:11.200 --> 46:13.200
it is clear that the manager,

46:13.200 --> 46:15.200
who was inclined to the authoritarian style

46:15.200 --> 46:17.200
and made all decisions unilaterally,

46:17.200 --> 46:19.200
will start making decisions

46:19.200 --> 46:21.200
collegially from tomorrow.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.200
If, for example, he communicated

46:23.200 --> 46:25.200
with his staff only through

46:25.560 --> 46:27.560
written communication,

46:27.560 --> 46:29.560
he never asked people

46:29.560 --> 46:31.560
how they were doing,

46:31.560 --> 46:33.560
what they were doing,

46:33.560 --> 46:35.560
what they were doing,

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
it is difficult to assume

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
that from tomorrow he will come

46:39.560 --> 46:41.560
to the department and say,

46:41.560 --> 46:43.560
hello, how are you?

46:43.560 --> 46:45.560
This will take a long time,

46:45.560 --> 46:47.560
and the process of its change

46:47.560 --> 46:49.560
will take place through training,

46:49.560 --> 46:51.560
development,

46:51.560 --> 46:53.560
personal development.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.920
This is a system that informs

46:55.920 --> 46:57.920
what will happen in the company,

46:57.920 --> 46:59.920
how it will change,

46:59.920 --> 47:01.920
what will change,

47:01.920 --> 47:03.920
what will it bring to the staff,

47:03.920 --> 47:05.920
how the staff can realize

47:05.920 --> 47:07.920
their potential, their goals,

47:07.920 --> 47:09.920
their motives within the framework

47:09.920 --> 47:11.920
of a new, updated corporate culture.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.920
At the end of the way,

47:13.920 --> 47:15.920
you should come to the conclusion

47:15.920 --> 47:17.920
that there should be stability

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
in new conditions

47:19.920 --> 47:21.920
and a complete adaptation

47:22.280 --> 47:24.280
of corporate culture standards.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.280
In addition to the fact

47:26.280 --> 47:28.280
that we analyze

47:28.280 --> 47:30.280
the corporate culture,

47:30.280 --> 47:32.280
it should be remembered

47:32.280 --> 47:34.280
that certain subcultures

47:34.280 --> 47:36.280
or microcultures are always formed

47:36.280 --> 47:38.280
in the company.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.280
Each structural unit

47:40.280 --> 47:42.280
forms its own microculture.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.280
Especially in special structural units

47:44.280 --> 47:46.280
there are microcultures

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
of their own.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.280
This can be dangerous

47:50.640 --> 47:52.640
because if you have

47:52.640 --> 47:54.640
a branch director

47:54.640 --> 47:56.640
of a representative of a unit

47:56.640 --> 47:58.640
in a special structural unit,

47:58.640 --> 48:00.640
who is a bright and strong leader

48:00.640 --> 48:02.640
and he has formed his own subculture

48:02.640 --> 48:04.640
or his own microculture,

48:04.640 --> 48:06.640
which for some reason

48:06.640 --> 48:08.640
suddenly dissonates

48:08.640 --> 48:10.640
with the general corporate culture

48:10.640 --> 48:12.640
and with the general standards,

48:12.640 --> 48:14.640
and you did not notice it,

48:14.640 --> 48:16.640
then in the event of changes

48:16.640 --> 48:18.640
it can cause serious resistance,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
sabotage

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
and this will slow down

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
the changes

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and as a result

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
the achievement of the business goals.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Because often there are situations

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
when the leaders of special structural units

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
think more about the categories

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
of their personal benefit

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
and personal success

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and their ambitions,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and not about the categories

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
of purpose for the business.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Then they become a hindrance

48:47.360 --> 48:49.360
on the way to the implementation

48:49.360 --> 48:51.360
of the changes.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.360
When I am asked

48:53.360 --> 48:55.360
what to do in this situation,

48:55.360 --> 48:57.360
I always say that it is necessary

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
to inform, motivate,

48:59.360 --> 49:01.360
explain to the leader

49:01.360 --> 49:03.360
the benefit and why we want

49:03.360 --> 49:05.360
to do it and involve him

49:05.360 --> 49:07.360
in the process of change.

49:07.360 --> 49:09.360
But if this does not work

49:09.360 --> 49:11.360
and the person is not ready

49:11.360 --> 49:13.360
to act within the framework of the existing culture,

49:13.360 --> 49:15.360
then such leaders must be left out.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.720
Because they will only interfere

49:17.720 --> 49:19.720
with the company and thereby

49:19.720 --> 49:21.720
interfere with the achievement of the company

49:21.720 --> 49:23.720
and its main goals.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.720
There are situations

49:25.720 --> 49:27.720
when the corporate culture

49:27.720 --> 49:29.720
does not resist changes.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.720
There are situations

49:31.720 --> 49:33.720
when there is a serious crisis in the company,

49:33.720 --> 49:35.720
when the first person

49:35.720 --> 49:37.720
of the organization changes

49:37.720 --> 49:39.720
and when the company

49:39.720 --> 49:41.720
is very young

49:41.720 --> 49:43.720
and there are no clear

49:44.080 --> 49:46.080
directions of action,

49:46.080 --> 49:48.080
values,

49:48.080 --> 49:50.080
missions,

49:50.080 --> 49:52.080
not even formalized.

49:52.080 --> 49:54.080
Sometimes they are not even

49:54.080 --> 49:56.080
consciously owned by the business.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
This happens at the startup stage

49:58.080 --> 50:00.080
in small and small companies.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.080
When we enter the market

50:02.080 --> 50:04.080
through the so-called strategy

50:04.080 --> 50:06.080
of ambitions,

50:06.080 --> 50:08.080
we want to earn a million

50:08.080 --> 50:10.080
for a certain period

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
and we do not study the market,

50:12.440 --> 50:14.440
we do not plan

50:14.440 --> 50:16.440
all the necessary marketing actions

50:16.440 --> 50:18.440
and moves,

50:18.440 --> 50:20.440
but we just break into the field

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
and start doing something.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.440
And in the process of the way,

50:24.440 --> 50:26.440
making mistakes,

50:26.440 --> 50:28.440
we begin to understand

50:28.440 --> 50:30.440
something about ourselves.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.440
When the first successes appear

50:32.440 --> 50:34.440
and the staff increases,

50:34.440 --> 50:36.440
we need to formalize

50:36.440 --> 50:38.440
and to realize

50:38.440 --> 50:40.440
where we are,

50:40.800 --> 50:42.800
what we are,

50:42.800 --> 50:44.800
and then to formalize

50:44.800 --> 50:46.800
certain standards, processes,

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
including the formalization

50:48.800 --> 50:50.800
of corporate culture.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.800
It happens not immediately

50:52.800 --> 50:54.800
and not always.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.800
Consciousness is not part

50:56.800 --> 50:58.800
of the culture,

50:58.800 --> 51:00.800
so there is nothing to resist.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.800
Or when the corporate culture

51:02.800 --> 51:04.800
is weak enough,

51:04.800 --> 51:06.800
although it can be said

51:06.800 --> 51:08.800
that the culture does not resist,

51:09.160 --> 51:11.160
but we need to remember

51:11.160 --> 51:13.160
that people within this culture

51:13.160 --> 51:15.160
can still resist.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.160
And now, please,

51:17.160 --> 51:19.160
complete the task 2

51:19.160 --> 51:21.160
in your notebook.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.160
Now we will talk about the tools

51:23.160 --> 51:25.160
of reforming corporate culture.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.160
How can we change corporate culture?

51:27.160 --> 51:29.160
Should we analyze all subcultures

51:29.160 --> 51:31.160
if changes are planned in one unit?

51:31.160 --> 51:33.160
And how to make a change

51:33.160 --> 51:35.160
in a subculture?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.160
How to make a change

51:37.160 --> 51:39.160
in a subculture?

51:39.160 --> 51:41.160
How to make a change

51:41.160 --> 51:43.160
in a subculture?

51:43.160 --> 51:45.160
How to make a change

51:45.160 --> 51:47.160
in a subculture?

51:47.160 --> 51:49.160
How to make a change

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
in a subculture?

51:51.160 --> 51:53.160
How to make a change

51:53.160 --> 51:55.160
in a subculture?

51:55.160 --> 51:57.160
We have already discussed this.

51:57.160 --> 51:59.160
Let's talk about it again.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.160
What can help us

52:01.160 --> 52:03.160
to change corporate culture?

52:03.160 --> 52:05.160
Radical changes of the external environment

52:05.160 --> 52:07.160
or some political trends.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
New value-oriented actions

52:09.160 --> 52:11.160
through planned actions.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.160
I have already talked about it.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.160
For example,

52:15.160 --> 52:17.160
the implementation of programs

52:17.160 --> 52:19.160
for reward for teamwork,

52:19.160 --> 52:21.160
results of activities, etc.

52:21.160 --> 52:23.160
A vivid example is

52:23.160 --> 52:25.160
rebranding

52:25.160 --> 52:27.160
which was implemented

52:27.160 --> 52:29.160
by Beeline.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.160
This fact is known.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.160
Beeline has a corporate university.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.160
And, in fact,

52:35.160 --> 52:37.160
the management of ideological

52:37.160 --> 52:39.160
component of corporate culture

52:39.160 --> 52:41.160
is implemented through the university.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.160
When a decision was made

52:43.160 --> 52:45.160
about rebranding

52:45.160 --> 52:47.160
Beeline's management

52:47.160 --> 52:49.160
through training, presentation

52:49.160 --> 52:51.160
and information

52:51.160 --> 52:53.160
was implemented.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
The management of the company

52:55.160 --> 52:57.160
was implemented

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
from the management to all the staff.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.160
The training and presentation

53:01.160 --> 53:03.160
were conducted

53:03.160 --> 53:05.160
by Beeline's managers.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.160
The questions were discussed

53:07.160 --> 53:09.160
not only about

53:09.160 --> 53:11.160
how the brand will change

53:11.160 --> 53:13.160
and how it will look

53:13.160 --> 53:15.160
but also about

53:15.160 --> 53:17.160
how the approach to service

53:17.160 --> 53:19.160
and client standards

53:19.160 --> 53:21.160
will change.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
How the standards of interaction

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
will change.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.160
How the motivation of the staff

53:27.160 --> 53:29.160
will change.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.160
What benefits will the staff

53:31.160 --> 53:33.160
get from these changes.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.160
Only after the presentation

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
was conducted by the employees

53:37.160 --> 53:39.160
the brand

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
was launched

53:41.160 --> 53:43.160
on the market.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
When the customers

53:45.160 --> 53:47.160
and the external market

53:47.160 --> 53:49.160
learned about rebranding

53:49.160 --> 53:51.160
the staff already knew

53:51.160 --> 53:53.160
how to behave.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.160
Because after the presentation

53:55.160 --> 53:57.160
and the information

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
about what will happen

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
the staff had to be trained

54:01.160 --> 54:03.160
by the new standards.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.160
Then there was a fixation

54:05.160 --> 54:07.160
and certain programs

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
connected with the fixation

54:09.160 --> 54:11.160
and the new standards.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.160
The fixation was controlled

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
by the existing training system.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.160
That's why the corporate universities

54:17.160 --> 54:19.160
are often used as a tool

54:19.160 --> 54:21.160
for corporate management.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.160
What else can be changed?

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
The staff can be attracted

54:25.160 --> 54:27.160
with the competences

54:27.160 --> 54:29.160
that correspond

54:29.160 --> 54:31.160
to the new corporate culture.

54:31.160 --> 54:33.160
How is it done?

54:33.160 --> 54:35.160
We understand

54:35.160 --> 54:37.160
the corporate culture

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
and we form

54:39.160 --> 54:41.160
the corporate competences

54:41.160 --> 54:43.160
and we expand them

54:43.160 --> 54:45.160
and we adjust them

54:45.160 --> 54:47.160
to the new corporate culture.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.160
We understand the gap

54:49.160 --> 54:51.160
between the existing

54:51.160 --> 54:53.160
and the new.

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
We evaluate the existing staff

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
according to the new competences.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.160
We form a number of programs

54:59.160 --> 55:01.160
for the existing staff

55:01.160 --> 55:03.160
and we attract the staff

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
from outside

55:05.160 --> 55:07.160
to the competences

55:07.160 --> 55:09.160
that correspond

55:09.160 --> 55:11.160
to the new corporate culture.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.160
The only thing

55:13.160 --> 55:15.160
that needs to be taken into account

55:15.160 --> 55:17.160
is that if you are targeting

55:17.160 --> 55:19.160
the people,

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
it's clear that they are

55:21.160 --> 55:23.160
different from the existing people.

55:23.160 --> 55:25.160
These people correspond

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
to the existing culture.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.160
They are agents of change.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.160
And the new staff

55:31.160 --> 55:33.160
is a part of the new culture.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.160
Your task is

55:35.160 --> 55:37.160
to support these people

55:37.160 --> 55:39.160
and to instill

55:39.160 --> 55:41.160
the old people

55:41.160 --> 55:43.160
with the standards,

55:43.160 --> 55:45.160
values and competences

55:45.160 --> 55:47.160
that the new staff have.

55:47.160 --> 55:49.160
At the same time,

55:49.160 --> 55:51.160
you should adapt the new staff

55:51.160 --> 55:53.160
to the values of the old staff.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.160
Because the corporate culture

55:55.160 --> 55:57.160
never changes fundamentally.

55:57.160 --> 55:59.160
For example,

55:59.160 --> 56:01.160
it was one

56:01.160 --> 56:03.160
and it became another.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.160
Theoretically, it can happen,

56:05.160 --> 56:07.160
but it will take a long time.

56:07.160 --> 56:09.160
Or you need to change

56:09.160 --> 56:11.160
the staff completely.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
Usually, companies don't do that.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.160
If we have the owner

56:15.160 --> 56:17.160
and the main postulates

56:17.160 --> 56:19.160
of the mission and values,

56:19.160 --> 56:21.160
the corporate culture can be improved.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.160
But fundamentally,

56:23.160 --> 56:25.160
it will hardly change.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
Therefore, your task

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
is to assimilate the new people

56:29.160 --> 56:31.160
into the old corporate culture

56:31.160 --> 56:33.160
and to develop the existing staff

56:33.160 --> 56:35.160
to the competences

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
that the new staff will bring.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.160
It's a rather difficult task,

56:39.160 --> 56:41.160
but it's quite interesting.

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
What else can change

56:43.160 --> 56:45.160
the corporate culture?

56:45.160 --> 56:47.160
The dismissal of those workers,

56:47.160 --> 56:49.160
especially those who

56:49.160 --> 56:51.160
have a strongly contradictory

56:51.160 --> 56:53.160
strategy,

56:53.160 --> 56:55.160
in particular,

56:55.160 --> 56:57.160
if they are representatives

56:57.160 --> 56:59.160
of the special structural units

56:59.160 --> 57:01.160
that declare

57:01.160 --> 57:03.160
a contradictory

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
subculture.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.160
It helps to change

57:09.160 --> 57:11.160
the corporate culture.

57:11.160 --> 57:13.160
A personal example of the first person.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
That's why

57:15.160 --> 57:17.160
the changes that companies

57:17.160 --> 57:19.160
will make

57:19.160 --> 57:21.160
are often told

57:21.160 --> 57:23.160
by the first persons.

57:23.160 --> 57:25.160
The business owner

57:25.160 --> 57:27.160
is a general manager

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
with a high authority

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
who is in charge of the management

57:31.160 --> 57:33.160
and is involved in the strategy.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.160
It's done sometimes

57:37.160 --> 57:39.160
within the corporate universities.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
It may not be a corporate university,

57:41.160 --> 57:43.160
but the fact that the first persons

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
are involved in the changes

57:45.160 --> 57:47.160
is a fact.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
Moreover, they not only present,

57:49.160 --> 57:51.160
but also demonstrate

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
new behavior models

57:53.160 --> 57:55.160
and standards

57:55.160 --> 57:57.160
with their personal example.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.160
Then the employees become more loyal

57:59.160 --> 58:01.160
and believe in the leaders.

58:01.160 --> 58:03.160
The leaders are the first persons.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
They are the general managers.

58:07.160 --> 58:09.160
The initial audit

58:09.160 --> 58:11.160
and targeted events

58:11.160 --> 58:13.160
on the change

58:13.160 --> 58:15.160
of the corporate culture

58:15.160 --> 58:17.160
also contribute to the change.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.160
Another important factor

58:19.160 --> 58:21.160
is the involvement of the employees,

58:21.160 --> 58:23.160
clients and partners

58:23.160 --> 58:25.160
in the discussion of the attributes

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
of the existing corporate culture

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
and in the development

58:29.160 --> 58:31.160
of the standards

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
of the corporate culture

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
that we strive for

58:35.160 --> 58:37.160
and want to get.

58:37.160 --> 58:39.160
Together with them

58:39.160 --> 58:41.160
we form and formalize

58:41.160 --> 58:43.160
our values,

58:43.160 --> 58:45.160
maybe some slightly changed ones,

58:45.160 --> 58:47.160
which are intended to support

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
the strategy of the company.

58:49.160 --> 58:51.160
One of the tools

58:51.160 --> 58:53.160
that contributes to the implementation

58:53.160 --> 58:55.160
of the changes

58:55.160 --> 58:57.160
is the corporate university.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.160
The corporate university

58:59.160 --> 59:01.160
is an ideological machine.

59:01.160 --> 59:03.160
It is a tool of corporate management

59:03.160 --> 59:05.160
that is designed to create,

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
to train, to develop

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
the existing staff,

59:09.160 --> 59:11.160
the new staff,

59:11.160 --> 59:13.160
to form the staff

59:13.160 --> 59:15.160
ideologically,

59:15.160 --> 59:17.160
to put some ideological

59:17.160 --> 59:19.160
postulates,

59:19.160 --> 59:21.160
to create values

59:21.160 --> 59:23.160
that will help

59:23.160 --> 59:25.160
to identify

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
the employees

59:27.160 --> 59:29.160
from the company

59:29.160 --> 59:31.160
and, as a result,

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
to achieve the business goals.

59:33.160 --> 59:35.160
The corporate university

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
is a tool of corporate management

59:37.160 --> 59:39.160
to realize

59:39.160 --> 59:41.160
the strategic goals of the company.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.160
There are a lot

59:43.160 --> 59:45.160
of corporate universities

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
in Russia.

59:47.160 --> 59:49.160
Unfortunately,

59:49.160 --> 59:51.160
not all of them are Russian.

59:51.160 --> 59:53.160
Sometimes they are just

59:53.160 --> 59:55.160
educational centers,

59:55.160 --> 59:57.160
either internal or external.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.160
They don't solve the ideological task

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.160
or don't solve it at all.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.160
But from the point of view

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.160
of the Western standards,

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.160
the corporate university

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.160
solves the main task

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
in creating the ideology

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160
and forming the loyalty

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
of the company.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
I told you about the Beeline experience.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.160
Many Russian companies

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160
are implementing the same changes.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.160
The experience of the Western companies

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.160
is very interesting.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160
The company called

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.160
Walt Disney

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.160
tried to preserve

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.160
the dying corporate culture.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160
Because after Walt Disney's death,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160
the standards he created

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.160
were not

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.160
in the same place

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160
as the current one.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
The company

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
Walt Disney

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.160
was innovative

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.160
and constantly changing.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Moreover, Walt Disney

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.160
is the person

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.160
who created

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.160
certain approaches

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160
to the management of changes.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.160
For example,

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
he had three groups.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.160
The first group was

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160
the ideologists and creatives.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.160
They were creating the ideas.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.160
The third group

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
was the people who criticized

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.160
the ideas and took risks.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160
Then the ideas were finalized.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160
After the finalization,

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.160
the third group of the creators

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160
was the ones who implemented

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
the ideas.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
Thus, Walt Disney's company

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.160
was developing and new products

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.160
were coming.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.160
The new products of Walt Disney

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.160
are the cartoons we watch.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.160
When Walt Disney died,

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160
the company lost

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.160
its standards

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160
and innovation.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160
Then the corporate university

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.160
was created.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160
It was created to

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.160
constantly support the company

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.160
in the process of changes

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.160
and to preserve

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.160
the standards and ideological postulates

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.160
and to multiply

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.160
and give the opportunity

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
to the company to develop further.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.160
This is a very interesting experience

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.160
of the Western companies.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160
Another distinctive feature

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.160
of the corporate universities

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.160
is that the corporate universities

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160
are the internal lecturers.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
They are the top managers of the companies.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.160
They are actively involved in this.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160
It is clear that the initiators

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160
of any global changes

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.160
are the managers.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Moreover, the success of changes

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160
increases when

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160
the leaders are the initiators.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160
They are actively involved in this.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.160
That is why the ideology

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
is formed in the heads

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.160
and the ideology is mostly

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160
printed on the top.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160
That is why the top managers

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.160
are the internal lecturers

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.160
of the corporate universities.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160
This is a distinctive feature

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.160
of the corporate universities,

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.160
especially of the Western and Russian ones.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.160
Also, within the framework

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.160
of the corporate universities

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160
the values are transmitted

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.160
from the old employees

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.160
to the new ones.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.160
They are multiplied

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.160
and preserved.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.160
How and what tools

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.160
should be used

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160
to form the corporate culture

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160
of remote, isolated offices

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.160
or virtual offices?

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.160
I will not talk about

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.160
the corporate universities

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.160
because all employees

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
are trained there.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
The first step is

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160
to enter the company

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.160
through the corporate universities,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.160
to learn and to learn

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.160
about the values, standards

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.160
and missions.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160
How to support?

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.160
It is clear that you can support

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.160
only through the constant

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.160
communication and interaction.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.160
Regular meetings,

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160
video conferences,

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160
regular communication

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.160
and information about

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.160
the changes in the company,

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160
discussions,

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.160
regular interaction

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160
in the online mode.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160
There should not be a situation

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160
where the isolated structures

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.160
live their own life

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.160
and the head office lives its own.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
As soon as such a situation arises,

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.160
there is a serious danger

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160
that the isolated structures

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160
will form their own subculture

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.160
which is not a fact

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.160
and will be congruent

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.160
to the corporate culture

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160
of the head office.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
Then you may face

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160
serious problems.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160
Formalized things are used,

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.160
the corporate code,

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
which is used to register

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160
all the things,

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160
all the standards, values,

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.160
missions, standards of work,

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.160
standards of interaction,

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.160
standards of appearance,

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160
all the algorithms,

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.160
organizational structure,

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160
which are related to the corporate culture.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.160
Traditions are also introduced

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.160
through rituals.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160
For example,

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
rituals of promotion,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.160
rituals of movement,

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.160
rituals of reception to work,

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
rituals of resolving conflicts

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.160
and so on.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.160
I repeat that one of the tools

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.160
that forms the corporate culture

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160
and informs about the standards

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.160
that exist in the company

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160
is the corporate code of the company.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.160
The corporate code,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.160
as I said, includes

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160
almost all elements,

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160
but the components of the corporate code

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
look like this.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.160
These are some basic principles of work,

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.160
values and standards of behavior.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.160
Actually,

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160
it is filled with the content.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.160
Some time ago,

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.160
when we were studying

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160
with an American professor,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.160
I asked how the corporate code

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.160
looks like in the USA.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160
I was told that the corporate code

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.160
in the USA looks like a thick

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.160
big piece of paper

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.160
in which everything is

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.160
formalized and prescribed.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.160
Starting with the mission of values,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.160
as I said,

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.160
continuing with the organizational structure,

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.160
including the faces of the first people,

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160
their experience of work,

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.160
their life path,

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.160
then the standards of behavior,

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.160
standards of interaction,

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.160
in particular, if the company is engaged in sales,

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.160
then in this corporate code

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.160
everything related to sales

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.160
is prescribed and standardized.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.160
But this is a fairly living tool.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.160
Moreover,

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.160
considering the fact that the West

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.160
has gone far enough,

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160
and there are usually electronic documents in companies,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160
on the contrary,

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.160
employees are not given

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160
this corporate code,

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.160
but are given a hard drive,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.160
or they are used as a common resource

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.160
where they can be familiarized.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160
Certain programs are formed,

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160
which control,

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.160
either teach people through education,

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.160
or control the study of corporate standards.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160
Then people go through the assessment

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.160
of whether they understood

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.160
what is written in this corporate code.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
So,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.160
this document is quite alive.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.160
The professor I was studying with

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.160
said that if something new

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.160
appears in a company,

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.160
or a response to an objection,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.160
or a resolution of a conflict,

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.160
then it is immediately placed

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.160
in the corporate code.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.160
If something changes,

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.160
the structure changes,

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.160
it is immediately changed in the corporate code.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.160
This is an absolutely living document.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160
It lives together with the company.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.160
It does not live separately from the company.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.160
This is very important to understand.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.160
Because,

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.160
unfortunately,

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.160
sometimes managers and

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.160
personnel specialists

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160
think that they have

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160
created this document,

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.160
put it on the shelf,

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
and that's it.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.160
In the best case,

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.160
they have created an education system

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.160
at the stage of joining a company.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.160
For beginners.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160
This is not so.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.160
This document must be alive.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.160
It must live with the company.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.160
It contributes,

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.160
but also prevents

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.160
changes in corporate culture,

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.160
and, in particular,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.160
changes in the company.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.160
What is it?

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.160
First of all,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.160
it is a lack of development strategy.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.160
Next, it is a substitution of the process

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.160
of changing culture of advertising

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.160
or new jargon.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.160
This often happens when rebranding happens.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.160
Moreover,

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
sometimes consultants

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160
do rebranding

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.160
when they join a company.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.160
In order to get rid of taxes

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.160
or to make some changes.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160
Because sometimes

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160
the sign changes,

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.160
the facade changes,

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.160
but nothing changes

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.160
behind this facade.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.160
This is a substitution.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.160
Substitution of changes.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.160
It is clear that people

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160
will not believe in

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.160
the leadership

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.160
that will declare

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160
that changes will be made

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.160
after brand change.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.160
This will not contribute

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160
to the efficiency of the company.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.160
What else is a hindrance?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.160
In particular,

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.160
initiating changes from the middle level.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.160
Any global changes

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.160
must be initiated from the top level.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.160
In particular, changes that bring

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.160
changes to the corporate culture of the company.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.160
This does not mean that you should not be

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.160
involved in the implementation of a project.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.160
You should be involved in the implementation

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.160
of something new.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160
Moreover,

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.160
you should assess

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.160
how the projects you will implement

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160
will contribute to the improvement of the company.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160
And how much the existing corporate culture

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160
will interfere or not.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160
Global changes,

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160
changes that attract the value level,

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160
attract the strategy of the company,

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160
are initiated by the top management.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160
And then these changes

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
are much more effective.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.160
What else is a hindrance?

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.160
When short-term goals dominate.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160
When we live with some

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.160
minute needs,

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.160
we do not think and do not think

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.160
about the long-term prospects.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.160
There is a strategic planning

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.160
and strategic goals.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.160
And, in fact,

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.160
according to the same

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.160
Franklin's Pyramid,

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.160
long-term goals follow

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.160
the most important goals.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.160
When we think about the minute,

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.160
we do not think about the day after.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.160
We lose much more than when we think

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
about the long-term prospects

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.160
and global things.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.160
And one more obstacle.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.160
Cynicism as a consequence

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.160
of the lack of value.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.160
Cynicism is, in principle,

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.160
the lack of values.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.160
It is clear that

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160
cynics probably also have some values.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.160
But to a greater extent,

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.160
their absence is more important

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.160
than their values.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.160
A company cannot live without values

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.160
because then there will be no ideology

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.160
in the company,

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160
because then there will be no corporate ethics,

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160
corporate spirit and much more.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
Therefore, cynicism,

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.160
in particular, the cynicism of the top management,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160
is a serious obstacle

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.160
to the impact of the changes

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.160
in the corporate culture of the company.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.160
We can also refer to the diagram

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160
of the dependence

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.160
of corporate culture changes

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160
on the probability of efficiency.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160
In particular,

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160
when the top management

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160
supports the changes,

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.160
the efficiency increases.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.160
When the programs

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.160
that contribute to the changes

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160
go through training of the staff,

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160
the efficiency increases.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.160
When we have formalized,

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.160
understandable values

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.160
and on the basis of them

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160
corporate competencies are formed,

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.160
the efficiency increases.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.160
These are the three main components

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.160
that contribute to the changes

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.160
in the corporate culture

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160
and to the changes in the company.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160
Now, please complete the tasks 3 and 4

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.160
in your notebook.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.160
Political organization and corporate religion

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160
Political organization and corporate religion.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160
How does the political organization

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160
affect the corporate religion?

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.160
It is clear that

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.160
there are always certain political forces

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160
in the company

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160
that have some influence

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.160
and have power.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.160
If you plan these changes,

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.160
you need to understand

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.160
how these political forces

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.160
influence the corporate religion.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160
Will they influence

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.160
your country or not?

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.160
Moreover,

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160
when changes occur,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.160
for example,

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.160
if the top management

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160
is partially changed,

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.160
the top management

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160
that initiates the changes

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.160
and wants them

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.160
forms a political party.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160
The same political party

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.160
can be formed

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160
by the party that does not agree.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.160
Then there can be a conflict

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.160
of interests

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.160
and the company will be

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.160
plunged into a long-term

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.160
relationship.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160
If you are the initiator

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.160
of the changes,

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.160
you need to think

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.160
how to involve people

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.160
and how to interest them.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160
Because political parties

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.160
are formed

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160
sometimes

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160
out of their own ambitions,

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160
but without the company's interests.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.160
It is clear that it is not very good,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.160
but it should be taken into account

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.160
and paid attention to.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.160
Because people who participate

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.160
in the process of changes

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.160
play a very important role.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.160
They play the role

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.160
and the degree of power

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160
they have.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.160
If you approach changes

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160
purposefully

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.160
and want to manage them,

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.160
and this is your

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.160
correct political approach,

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.160
then you need to

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160
formulate the goals of the changes.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160
What are they for?

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160
What will be the result?

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160
You need to clarify

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.160
the map of dependency

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160
and interconnection.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.160
What influential people

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
affect your work

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160
and implementation of the project?

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.160
You need to predict

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.160
possible reactions

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.160
and points of view

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
that will influence you.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160
Then you need to analyze

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160
the main reasons for

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.160
the authorities

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.160
and all those who were

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160
highlighted in the previous stages.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.160
You need to analyze

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.160
the preferences of the authorities

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.160
and the initiator of the changes.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.160
You need to search for additional

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.160
sources of power

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.160
to control the situation.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160
Because you need to have the power

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.160
to successfully implement

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160
the changes.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.160
You need to choose the right strategy

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.160
and political approach

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
to the current situation

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160
in your company.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160
But there is politics

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.160
and there is ideology.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.160
You can play political games

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.160
or think of categories

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160
of business purpose

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
and be ideological with the company.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
We are ideological with the company

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.160
when our values coincide,

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160
when we can and can realize

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160
our goals and motives

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160
within the company.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160
But how can we understand

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.160
that our goals and motives

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.160
coincide? We understand it

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160
through information.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
When we understand it,

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160
we accept it and believe in it.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160
Then we go with the company

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.160
and we want to be successful

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.160
and help it.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
We identify ourselves with the company

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160
and we are proud of our work.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
If we don't accept it,

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160
we are still working within the company.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160
Then we are not motivated

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.160
to be effective.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.160
We are demotivated.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160
We are more harmful than beneficial.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160
That's why any changes

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160
in the company

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160
need to be realized

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.160
through information.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.160
Because we understand it

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.160
during the process of information.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.160
Then we associate it

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.160
with ourselves,

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.160
our values, goals and motives.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.160
If everything is OK,

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.160
we believe and stay.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.160
If something is not OK,

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.160
we don't believe and leave.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.160
If a employee is loyal to the company,

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160
when he understands

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160
that he can't realize

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160
all his goals and motives

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.160
within the changed corporate culture

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160
of the company,

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160
he still reacts flexibly

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.160
to it.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.160
He leaves his goals and motives

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160
somewhere deep inside himself.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160
Part of his goals and motives.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.160
If all of them are not realized,

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.160
he will leave.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.160
He stays with the company

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.160
because he thinks

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.160
about business.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.160
It's a very important thing.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.160
It's a formula

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160
to understand, accept and believe.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160
Actually,

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160
many approaches of Western companies

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.160
are described in the book

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.160
of Kundi, the corporate religion.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.160
In the part on the realization

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.160
of corporate ideology.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.160
Not only corporate universities,

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.160
but other instruments

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.160
are used by Western companies.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160
For example, Harley Davidson

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160
was distinguished by the fact

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160
that all of its top management

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160
was truly

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.160
involved in Harley Davidson's motorcycles.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160
They were actually

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160
the supporters

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.160
of this idea.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160
They breathed it,

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160
they lived it.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160
It was their value.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.160
I can say that

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.160
from the point of view

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.160
of ideological machine

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160
that existed in Soviet times,

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
it was one of the strongest.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.160
In fact,

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.160
America itself

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160
took a lot of the tools

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160
used by the Soviet Union.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160
Now it's served

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.160
through a prism of some shows

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.160
when there is an emotional charge,

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.160
when people gather

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160
and start singing hymns,

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.160
shouting slogans,

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160
missions and so on.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.160
I can tell you

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.160
one interesting example.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.160
I worked in a company

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.160
that tried to realize

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.160
such standards,

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.160
ideological ones.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.160
It worked well

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.160
in one of the special

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.160
structural units.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160
What did the director of this branch do?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.160
He gathered all the employees

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.160
of the back office,

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160
front office,

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160
sales representatives,

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.160
supervisors

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160
and turned on cartoons

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
for 10 minutes.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160
He charged them emotionally,

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160
he sent positive energy to them.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160
Then there was a short

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.160
five-minute show

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.160
that was based on

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160
the principles of our work.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160
People went to the fields.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160
They left in a good mood.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.160
On the one hand.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.160
On the other hand,

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.160
they were very loyal.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.160
There was the minimum flow.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160
It was almost none.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160
There are situations

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160
when the speakers are invited

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.160
to the talks

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.160
to maintain the emotional background

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.160
and identity of the company.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.160
They speak quite emotionally

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.160
at the conferences.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.160
During the conference

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.160
they discuss the corporate competencies.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.160
For example, client-orientedness,

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160
team-basedness,

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.160
uniqueness.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160
Everyone has his own corporate competence.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160
Everyone means something for it.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160
During the discussion

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160
of the corporate competence

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.160
they talk about

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.160
the happiness of working in the company.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.160
How great it is!

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160
How proud we are!

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.160
People...

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.160
Usually, the conferences are quite extensive.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.160
People from the specialised

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160
cultural departments

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.160
leave in a good mood.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.160
We can think of it

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160
in different ways.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.160
The brain-formatting

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.160
is a good thing.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.160
Ideology is

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.160
a part of the state.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.160
The company is

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.160
a prototype of the state.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.160
The fact that there is a state

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.160
and my listeners

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.160
often tell me

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160
about corporate culture.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160
I say, of course,

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160
we have it in our state.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.160
The company is a prototype of the state.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.160
The tools of managing people,

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.160
the formation of values,

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.160
the ideology that exists in the state

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
also exist in the company.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.160
Everything is fine

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160
within reason.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160
As they say,

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.160
the dose is not important,

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.160
but the medicine.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160
If there is a overdose,

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.160
nothing good will happen.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.160
It is very important to use

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.160
these tools in reasonable limits.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
Moreover, with a clear understanding

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.160
whether they correspond

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.160
to your corporate culture,

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.160
whether the staff will accept you or not.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.160
It is important not to overdo it.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160
It is also important

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.160
that the postulates you put

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.160
in people's heads

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160
are consistent and uniform.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.160
Everyone lives by the same standards.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.160
If you put these standards

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.160
in people's heads

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.160
and tell them to act like this,

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160
and your top management,

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
business owners,

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.160
will declare and demonstrate

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.160
completely different behavior patterns,

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.160
people will never believe it.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.160
They will not follow you.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.160
They will not believe your company.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.160
They will think that they are being deceived.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160
Most likely, they will leave the company.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.160
And decide whether to use

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160
these tools or not,

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160
in what volume,

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
with what frequency,

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160
and for what category of staff.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.160
It is up to you,

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.160
individually, in each case.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.160
Because only you know

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.160
what your company is,

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.160
what are its features,

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.160
what are its values,

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.160
and what is its corporate culture.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.160
I told you a little about

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.160
the experience of the company,

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.160
the experience of Beeline.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.160
I can say that

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.160
these are quite positive experiences.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160
I will not name the companies

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.160
that used not very positive experiences

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
in the same rebranding.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160
When the company launched

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.160
a new brand and did not

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160
provide any information

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.160
about what will change in the company.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.160
At least, the answer to the question

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.160
why you have become like this.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.160
One of the well-known companies

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.160
that did rebranding

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
went to the market with new brands

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.160
when consumers asked

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.160
why you changed your brand,

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.160
what has changed.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160
The employees were surprised

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.160
to see the consumers

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.160
and said that they did not know anything.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.160
What do you think?

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.160
Did the company gain

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.160
more respect and trust?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.160
It is unlikely.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
Even if the employees themselves

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
do not know what is happening

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160
in their companies,

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160
they cannot clearly and argumentatively

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160
inform the consumer.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.160
It is clear that the consumer

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160
does not know what is going on.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160
Maybe there is a crash,

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.160
maybe we will have problems.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160
We better vote by foot

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
and go to another company.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.160
This is how the influence

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.160
of management of changes in the company

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.160
influences.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.160
In particular, at the stage of rebranding.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.160
The situation with the influence

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.160
of absorption.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160
There are situations

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.160
when companies merge

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160
and absorb.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160
There is no clear understanding

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.160
of how the corporate culture

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160
will change.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.160
And there is a surge of shaking.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.160
The company can go through

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.160
a long period of process

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160
of merging and absorption.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160
If there is a separate

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.160
structural division in the company,

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.160
at the stage of merging and absorption,

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.160
when this process is going on,

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.160
they begin to form their corporate culture.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.160
And a subculture.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160
Then this subculture

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160
can show up

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160
as a slow-moving mine.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.160
This is a risk that

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.160
can be avoided with a deliberate

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160
and conscious management.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160
What are the paradoxes

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
of information transformation changes?

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160
Surprisingly, the older and more stable

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.160
the organization, the more difficult

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.160
it is to start a process of change.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.160
This is a predictable paradox.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160
The older the company,

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.160
the more established

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.160
the norms, rules and standards.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.160
Even if they are not formalized.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160
Imagine a bureaucratic machine

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.160
that used to live by its standards

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160
in the Soviet Union.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160
Most of the staff

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160
has been working

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160
for 20-40 years.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160
Suddenly, young managers

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160
come and try to implement

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160
some Western standards.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.160
There was a tough machine

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160
that had subordination,

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160
bureaucratic standards.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160
And suddenly,

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160
new things appear.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.160
It is clear that

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.160
the existing environment,

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160
the conservative environment,

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160
will actively resist

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160
these changes.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.160
This is what happens in government structures

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.160
where new managers

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160
and new formations

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160
come in and the staff

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160
starts to growl and actively resist.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Unfortunately,

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160
this is what happens.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160
Some staff leaves

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160
because of these changes

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.160
or because they don't understand

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
the benefits of these changes.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160
Sometimes we lose important people

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160
that we can't find on the market.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Or we part with those people

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160
who stop the process of change

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.160
and prevent the company

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160
from moving forward.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160
What else is a paradox?

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160
A manager who hired a new employee

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160
who has a corporate culture

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160
and is more progressive

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160
should balance

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160
two things.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160
He should balance

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160
the basic values of the existing company

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160
and its values

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160
and competencies

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.160
that are a bit ahead

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160
of the competencies

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160
of the existing employees.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160
This should be taken into account.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160
Please, complete tasks 5 and 6

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160
in your notebook.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160
What conclusions can be drawn?

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.160
What conclusions can be drawn?

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160
A corporate culture

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.160
is not bad or good.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.160
It can be appropriate.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160
A corporate culture

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160
or even a subculture

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160
can be a catalyst

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160
for the change.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160
It can slow down the change.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.160
Reforming a corporate culture

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160
is a long and complex process

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.160
that takes a long time.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.160
You should approach this process

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160
responsibly,

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.160
consciously and planarly.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.160
Cultural aspects

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.160
of projects on merging and absorption

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.160
are one of the most important

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160
factors of success.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.160
I gave you an example

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160
of the same TNK-BP.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.160
You should carefully

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.160
approach the choice

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.160
of external consultants

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160
that you will invite

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.160
for the reforming

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.160
of your corporate culture.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.160
Thank you for your attention.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160
I wish you success.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.160
Goodbye.
