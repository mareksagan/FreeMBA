00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Good afternoon, my name is Evgenia Varlamova.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I have 15 years of experience in the field of staff management

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
and have successfully implemented projects in such companies as

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Eastline, Domodedovo International Airport,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Azon Internet Store,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
and the international IT company CarTech Limited.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
At the moment, I work as a Director of the Investment and Financial Group

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Broker Credit Service.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
I am pleased to present to you the topic

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
of the Corporate Training Center as a tool for planning a career.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
As you know, our managers and investors are so advanced

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
that arguments on how to manage staff that are only in the plane

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
of increasing salaries and material motivation, social packages,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
no longer work.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Our management is interested in soft tools for motivating and

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
maintaining staff, such as training, planning a career.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
This argument now works very well for both employees

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
and candidates whom we want to involve in the company.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Unfortunately, business is growing slower than the level of

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
labor payment in Russia, and therefore we really do not even have a way out,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
except to apply soft tools in maintaining and attracting staff.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
In my experience, candidates talk less about the possibilities of

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
salaries, social packages, planned increases.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
They rather talk about the career,

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
about the positions that they will occupy from the very beginning

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
and what opportunities they will have in terms of responsibility and growth.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
What opportunities in terms of career the company offers them for the next six months,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
a year, two years and a more distant future.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
It is how we will build the career of our employees,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
show them the horizons of their growth in our company.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
It is from this that it depends how much money we will really spend on our employees,

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
what salary level we will offer them and how long we will successfully cooperate with our employees.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
Today we will talk about how we can plan the career of employees in our company

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
and how career planning corresponds to all other functions of staff management.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
Today we will focus on the training center, the corporate university

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
and all possible methods of training staff as the main mechanism for career development.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
I will tell you a little about the company in which we have promoted this project the most,

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
about the career planning itself, what it consists of and about the system of the corporate university,

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
how the corporate university and all methods of training and development of staff can work on career planning.

03:10.000 --> 03:20.000
In my experience, it is in high-tech companies that candidates and employees pay special attention to their career growth opportunities.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
We mean not only horizontal development, which is most often limited,

03:26.000 --> 03:37.000
but also flat organizational structure, in which there are only a few levels, 3, 4, 5 levels.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Thus, the vertical opportunities for career growth are quite limited.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Thus, each HR receives such a creative task,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
in the same way, without violating the organizational structure of the company,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
to show each employee the opportunities for professional growth

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
and motivate him with the content of work, not only with salary and the name of positions.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
So, the main principles of career planning.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
We in the company declare the value of training and development of staff.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Moreover, these positions can be described from the job offer,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
that is, even before a person becomes our employee.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
In the proposal for work, we prescribe not only the compensation package,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
but also pay special attention to the opportunities for training an employee,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
the opportunities for his career growth.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
And with some candidates, we are already at the stage of negotiations,

04:47.000 --> 04:59.000
until the candidate is our employee, we agree on what real promotion in his position he can get during the first year of work.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
For a longer term, our candidates in Russia do not often look,

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
but it is very important for them that we, as a company, can offer them during the first year of work,

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
if our cooperation develops positively, we will be satisfied with the employee and he will be satisfied with his work.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
It is very important at the stage of the interview with the candidate,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
when we are not yet associated with any official obligations to each other, to find out the level of his ambitions.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
It is at this moment that we can expect that the candidate will be able to reveal his ambitions and interests more,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
since he is not yet bound by any labor relations with the employer.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
It is at this moment that it is important to identify and concretize his ambitions,

05:46.000 --> 05:55.000
because if we take an employee with high ambitions for a position that does not imply serious career growth,

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
then we will lose the company's money and lose the time of the employee.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Thus, it is very important to discuss many psychological details at the time of the interview,

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
which will show us how the career of this employee in the company can be successful.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
For example, we consider a candidate for the position of an accountant,

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
but during the interview he tells us about his professional dreams in the field of finance,

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
he wants to be a financial analyst, and in 5-10 years he wants to take the position of a financial director.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
And we understand that in the next two years he will hardly be able to get such a promotion in the company,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
so it is better to tell the candidate about this at the stage of the interview,

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
and to look for a candidate for this position, who has less ambitions,

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
and with whom we will have less headaches as soon as he takes this position and joins our company in labor relations.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
The planning of a career depends on the position we take on a person, on his ambitions, on his personality.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
We can clarify these details during the interview.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Also, in companies, as a rule, now in most companies,

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
annually or even quarterly, the evaluation of the results of the employee's activity is carried out,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
the so-called KPI, with key indicators of efficiency.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
And it is very important to position that the result of the employee

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
will have a serious impact on his career planning and possible promotions.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
Employees themselves most often associate the assessment, which in some companies is called attestation,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
rather with the payment of bonuses, with a raise in salary,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
and rarely think that this can affect their career.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
The manager's participation in such interviews,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
in the evaluation interview, is very important,

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
because it is in this interview, in this evaluation conversation of the manager with his subordinate,

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
that some dissatisfaction with the employee may be revealed regarding his current functionality, current duties.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
And new ambitions may be revealed, something that we, for example, did not see half a year ago.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Now the world is changing very quickly, business is changing very quickly.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
Our company is in a very energetic changing environment,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
and therefore the ideas of employees, their thoughts, their ambitions,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
they can change very energetically as well.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And once a quarter, once every six months, this is just the period when it is important to understand

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
where this employee has advanced, how he suits the company,

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
where he can be more effective, what additional functionality he is ready to perform and, accordingly, choose for himself.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
And usually, I would also recommend in the interview on the assessment of the effectiveness of employees,

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
include a very important block of planning, training and development.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
You can use special forms of the individual development plan,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
where we discuss with the employee not only his results for the past period,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
but also his plans for the next period, including in terms of responsibility and functions.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
And this is just the best time to talk to him about the capabilities of their company in its training and development.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
When we talk about training, already looking at the plane of training,

09:47.000 --> 09:58.000
we can say that very often now candidates ask in the job offer to write down what responsibility the company is ready to take

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
at the stage of negotiations with the future employee about his training.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
So, for some employees at certain positions, we can even write that the company,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
during the first quarter, the first six months of work,

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
the first year of work, must train the employee on such topics, on such courses.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
And for candidates for work now it has become very significant,

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
especially those positions that are associated with a certain level of certification,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
such as, for example, in the financial sphere.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
HR often places this as such an important condition for technical employees, programmers.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.000
And here it is a very serious signal that says that this candidate is serious about his career,

10:49.000 --> 10:59.000
he has certain plans and he considers the work in our company not just as a banal work device,

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
but also as a way to earn money in the plane of developing his career.

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
And here, of course, it is also important for us to ask him in more detail what ideas he has in terms of his professional future

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
and evaluate from the point of view of the employer how long we can be interesting to each other with this employee.

11:21.000 --> 11:29.000
In my experience, it has been meaningful to talk about the horizon of planning for no more than two years.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
Usually, candidates consider the possibility of their relationship with a new employer at this time.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
And from the point of view of us as employers, this is also a comfortable period

11:41.000 --> 11:51.000
during which we can at least get a ready-to-work candidate in our company.

11:51.000 --> 11:59.000
I usually describe it in such words that you understand that the company will invest its time, its experience in you,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
and you will work with colleagues who will share their experience, their technologies.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
The company has certain very serious technological developments,

12:10.000 --> 12:18.000
and therefore it would be important for us as a company that you plan your employment with us for at least two years.

12:18.000 --> 12:28.000
And only in this horizon of planning can we discuss our responsibility as an employer in terms of planning a career and in terms of your training.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
As a rule, such a horizon of planning is comfortable for the employee and for the company.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
In reality, this period is not always withstood.

12:39.000 --> 12:49.000
Some employees work significantly longer, and we have to part with some employees for quite objective reasons.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
It is very important not to lower the training plans from top to bottom,

12:57.000 --> 13:07.000
as a big project of the company, but to involve employees in the study, to involve employees in the discussion of the needs of the study.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
And we do it in a variety of ways, using all possible reasons for this.

13:14.000 --> 13:23.000
Starting with the reception at work, when we ask such a question for the identification of the interests of the candidates,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
we ask such a question as what would you like to learn more about, what training would you like to go through,

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
what do you think could be interesting to you and would help your efficiency at work.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
Also, all interviews with assessments and attestations of employees, assessments of their performance,

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
they can also serve the purpose of building up plans for the training and development of a person.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
But it is also very important to prevent such a consumer attitude of employees to the company.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
When an employee peddles the topic that the company should train him, the company should promote him,

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
it is very important to shift the focus and emphasize that the company also expects from the employee his efforts,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
his professional efforts, his self-training.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
And training is a mutual process, not a process in one direction.

14:21.000 --> 14:28.000
And in order to increase the responsibility of the employee, we, before expensive training, of course,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
sign a student contract with the person.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
And besides, we show in a special format how one or another training,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
how one or another training should affect the efficiency, the effectiveness of the work of the employee.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
And the central, central for the career planning system and for the training system is, of course,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
the corporate competence model.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Here on this slide you can see an example of such a model.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Here it consists of 10 competencies.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
In each company it can be different.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Competencies can depend on specific positions,

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
can be developed individually for each group of positions,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
or it can be a general corporate model.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
It depends on how much time the HR has for its development and at what stage the company is.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
But at least one corporate competence model,

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
which depends on the level of the employee,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
depends on their professional specialization, of course, it should be.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Here you see a model of competence out of 10 competencies,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
which is designed specifically for a high-tech company working in the field of e-commerce.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
The company industry, it imposes a very large imprint,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
and greatly affects the composition of the competence.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
As you can see, special attention is paid to innovation,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
positive thinking, positive communication.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
This means that in an innovative company, an innovative industry,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
competencies are very important,

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
which determine the style of communication between employees and the nature of their work.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
It is very important for a company that people show innovation,

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
that they feel free to make decisions and share ideas with each other.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Here you see a very important competence, positive thinking, positive communication.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
It is about making it easier for people and employees to share ideas with each other

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
and to organize working groups to discuss problems or areas of problems

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
in order to jointly develop a group solution, a group idea.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Here you see that there is a special competence of teamwork, business thinking,

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
and, of course, professionalism, which depends on the professional field in which a person works.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I would say that this is a universal competence.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Here the manager assesses the employee,

17:12.000 --> 17:23.000
how much his level of knowledge and experience meet the needs of the company.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
In the next slide, we can see an example of a bar,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
an assessment of key indicators of efficiency.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
This is a bar that is used in assessments of the efficiency of employees,

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
which, as I said, takes place once a quarter, once every six months or once a year, depending on the company.

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
And here is a very important point that every goal that we set for a person for the next period of work

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
must be necessarily prescribed, it must be weighted,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
it must be assigned a certain weight, a certain importance.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
And we must tell the employee what exactly result we expect from him, at what level.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
And the most important point is that the employee himself is signed in this bar.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And as a result, after a certain period of time,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
this is a quarter, six months or a year,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
the employee and the manager meet again,

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
and they have a great opportunity to assess what goals have been achieved,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
achieved at the expected level,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
what goals have been achieved, but at a level lower than expected,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
what goals have not been achieved, and for what reason.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
And this is a great opportunity to assess what we have not achieved,

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
what prevented us, and what plans in training and development we can offer a person here.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
That is, what we as a company can offer an employee in terms of increasing his knowledge,

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
increasing his experience, his professional competencies.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
On the other hand, the employee himself must also think about this.

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
And, as a rule, employees are already preparing for the assessment of their performance in a few weeks.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And a special training is held in the company,

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
when we teach managers how to conduct feedback on the results of the assessment of performance.

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
And we teach the employees how to best use this wonderful opportunity of interview on the results of their activities.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
And here on the next slide we can see the simplest format,

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
which is also used as a result of the interview on the results of the work of the employee.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Here is the individual training plan.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
Here we write what the goal of the training is, what we want to train employees for,

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
the training plan, the topic, the deadlines, and what results we expect.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
In addition, here you can also enter a column for which competence a particular training will work.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
And this allows us, on the one hand, to plan the training more accurately for the staff.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
These blanks are submitted to the training center after the assessment.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
And the training center can already assess the needs of the company in training and plan the training for the next period.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
And, of course, as you understand, the most effective use of such formats in an electronic form.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
And now there are already many programs for managing staff,

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
which allow you to automate the assessment process of performance,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
and planning training, and also planning a career.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
So, now let's talk about career planning.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
From the point of view of employees, as a rule, career planning is a company's obligation.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
What positions should the company offer him at a certain time horizon.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
But from the point of view of HR and from the point of view of the company,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
career planning is a determination, together with the employee,

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
to make clear prospects for his professional development within the framework of the company's strategic development.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
This is a very important point,

21:17.000 --> 21:24.000
since we plan the career of employees not only based on their ambitions, their professional desires, plans,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
but, first of all, of course, from the point of view of the company's strategic plans.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Here you can give such an example.

21:33.000 --> 21:43.000
For example, in one IT company, where the main staff are software specialists and software implementation,

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
when the company changed its strategy and changed the focus of its activities from software development to its implementation,

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
we conducted a special interview with each programmer on the subject of his interests, his ambitions,

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
and used different levers, different methods to help programmers realize how interesting it would be for them,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
that it would be interesting for them not only to program and work with code,

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
but also to work with the client and implement software products.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Of course, we understand the limitations of this approach,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
that there are programmers who do not want to see the client in principle,

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
but there are also a certain number of programmers who are ready to consider the possibility of working with clients at a certain time horizon

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
and can see how the client's work on the implementation of software products, how it promotes them professionally.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
And here it is very important for us, as HR, to be able to argue this position, which is very important for the company,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
and can also be beneficial for the employees themselves,

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
because they will be able to further develop within the company and develop their professional skills and knowledge.

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
That is, our main goal in planning a career is to create a synergy of interests of the company and the employee,

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
which is achieved through numerous negotiations, numerous interviews and numerous methods of managing staff.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Thus, with the help of planning a career, we solve several tasks at once.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
This is not material motivation.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
It would seem that this is paradoxical, but nevertheless,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
simply because the manager of the staff, the head of the employee,

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
once a quarter or once every six months, talks to the employee and discusses his ambitions,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
his professional goals, his needs in training and development,

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
only one of these facts already reduces the tension in the team

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
and gives the employees a clearer perspective of their professional path in the company.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
This significantly affects motivation.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
We also achieve the reduction of liquidity by planning a career,

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
because employees who see their prospects in the company are less likely to leave the competition,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
since they see their opportunities with us.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
In addition, employees work more energetically, more motivatedly.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
That is, in the same time, with the help of the same resources, we achieve a greater result.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Therefore, I would say that planning a career is such a universal tool and a very powerful tool.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
The only thing is that certain resources are necessary here.

24:39.000 --> 24:50.000
In the next slide, we can see a pyramid that shows how different companies are moving towards this topic.

24:50.000 --> 24:58.000
At the first level, the number K1, it shows that many companies are thinking about planning a career

24:58.000 --> 25:06.000
only when an employee comes with his application and says about his intention to leave the company.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
Then the boss calls HR manager and says, listen, talk to him, maybe you will offer him something,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
or let's think together.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
This is such a natural solution to the problem of planning a career.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
Further, at the second stage, management, after a certain number of such cases,

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
when employees want to leave, but the reason is not only money, but also career prospects,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
the management sets us a goal.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
Let's somehow describe how our employees can develop within the company.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
In fact, this is a very difficult technological task, very difficult.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
It is very important to analyze the entire organizational structure,

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
taking into account the fact that employees can grow their careers not only in their management vertical,

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
but it is also important to highlight the entire blocks of the organizational structure,

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
within which employees can change their positions and move from one department to another.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
For example, it was once very surprising for us that Western companies,

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
in order to keep HR manager inside the company, changed HR manager specialization every two years.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
There are a lot of different and very serious differentiated functions in HR management.

26:35.000 --> 26:44.000
For example, salary management, compensation management, training and development management, or recruiting.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
These are completely different areas, they require different qualifications and different experience.

26:49.000 --> 26:58.000
But Western companies went for changing HR manager specialization every two years.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
This achieved the goal that HR manager's interest remained inside the company,

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
he worked longer than other companies where specialization did not change.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Of course, this is an additional expense for the company.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
The company conducts special training, loses efficiency when hiring a new employee,

27:21.000 --> 27:30.000
but nevertheless, the goal of the team is to maintain the corporate competencies,

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
since in the fruit companies, not only professional competencies, but also corporate competencies are important.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
The fact that a person owns all the subtleties, all the values of the company.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And thus it was possible to keep employees longer.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
And only at the third stage, here you see a yellow figure,

27:53.000 --> 28:06.000
at the third stage, the function of career planning becomes a full-fledged function of HR management.

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
Here it is interconnected with other functions of HR management.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
Career planning is interconnected with training and development of staff.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
But this is not the highest horizon that a company can reach in this area.

28:25.000 --> 28:33.000
So, at the fourth stage, the company already more clearly integrates this function of career planning

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
into the rest of the functions of HR management.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
It is connected with the corporate training center.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
At the highest stage of career planning in the company,

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
we already see career planning as a corporate value of the company.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
And what is usually called a self-training organization.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
A self-training organization, which is imbued with the cult of coaching.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
When each new employee or employee who is transferred to another position has a special coach,

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
who will help him overcome both personal and professional barriers at a new position.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
And a culture of development, when training is held not only in training classes,

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
not only in out-of-town seminars, but also at work.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Thus, as you can see, at least five stages,

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
by which the company can grow and develop its attitude to career planning.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
So, the key elements of the career are key competencies.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
When we discuss with an employee the possibility of developing his career,

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
we are not talking about positions and money, which are associated with these positions.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
First of all, we are talking about key competencies and the level of their development.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
How does his competence profile correspond to the profile of this position?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
What are the GPs?

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
What are the key competencies that he has not yet developed enough?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
And how can the company help in this?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
What training and development plan can the company offer?

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Also, the second element, as you can see on this slide,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
a very important slide in my opinion,

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
the second element of career planning is career options.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
This is just an intellectual product of HR and managers,

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
who will show how within the framework of this organizational structure

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
each employee can grow in his career and in his professionalism.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Career paths, we will show it separately,

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
they should be related to the business logic,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
not just to the logic and ambition of employees.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
And the third element of career planning is the effort of the employee himself.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
That is, we emphasize during the interview,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
the interview can be about career planning,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
or interview about assessment of results,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
or about planning an individual development plan.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
In this interview, we focus the employee's attention

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
on what efforts are necessary on his part

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
in order to develop the key competencies

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
that are necessary for the next stage of his career growth.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
And, as I said, on the next slide we can see

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
what a career looks like from the employee's point of view.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
The employee sees that here are the next positions

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
and the next level of salaries,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
the next power, the status in the company,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
the place in the hierarchy.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
From the point of view of the company,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
as we see on the next slide,

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
the career path of an employee looks somewhat different.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
It is very important for the company to receive a new level of responsibility from the employee,

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
a new level of development of key competencies,

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
for each of the next positions.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
And the company wants to see what efforts

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
the person is ready to make

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
in order to develop himself

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
in accordance with the requirements of the next stage of his career.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
How does the company manage the careers?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Here on this slide is shown a simple scheme,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
but it is very clear.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
So, we evaluate the employees.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
The evaluation of the staff means

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
the evaluation of the employee's performance,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
the evaluation of his competencies.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The next point is the career options

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
that we can offer to the person.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
As a rule, this is a professional career or a management career,

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
and the training system that will support this wonderful process.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
So, on this slide I tried to reflect

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
the stages of creating a career planning system.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
From my experience,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
it is constructed in this way.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
As you know, the company's work structure

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
does not always reflect the real specifics of the business

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
and the real business process.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
The work structure can age,

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
it can be in a constant state of change,

33:17.000 --> 33:25.000
and therefore, in order to plan and create career paths,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
it is better to rely not on formal documents,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
but rather on communication with managers.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
And when we ask managers very simple questions,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
such as how the career of employees usually develops,

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
what employees are the most successful in your opinion,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
how they made their careers,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
from which departments they came to you,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
what departments their career can develop further,

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
in this way you will informally receive information

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
from managers about the real logic of the development of the career of employees

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
that has already taken place at the moment,

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
which the company may not even sometimes guess about.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
The second point in creating a career planning system

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
is the creation of assessment tools.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
Assessment tools are a model of competencies

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
and how we will measure these competencies.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
These can be assessment centers,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
expert assessments,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
structured interviews,

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
anything that coincides with the specificity of this industry

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
and specific competencies.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Then individual career growth plans are developed and implemented,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
and as a result, a training system is created

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
that supports this career planning.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
The career planning system in the company,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
as you can see, is very serious,

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
intellectually and organizationally.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
The whole process can take from six months to one and a half to two years.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
It all depends on the motivation of the managers themselves,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
on the inclusion of managers,

35:09.000 --> 35:17.000
and on how the company evaluates the relevance of this system.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Here, for example,

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
the question of how much information can be obtained only informally,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
can be given as an example.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
In one IT company, as in many others,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
all programmers were divided into three blocks.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
This is programming itself,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
service desk,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
how to serve clients,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
and implementation.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Three large organizational blocks,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
three large divisions.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And since employees change,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
and managers change periodically,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
it was not easy to get complete information

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
about how employees usually do their careers.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
And only by means of communication with key employees,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
who work the longest in the company,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
and with managers,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
it was possible to understand that,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
depending on the interests and ambitions of employees,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
the planning of a career can be very different.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
For some employees,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
it is more interesting to communicate with clients,

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
so they try to get into the implementation department in every possible way.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
Some programmers do not want to know anything about the client,

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
and then they position themselves in the development department.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And the less popular,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
or at least the least popular part,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
is the service of clients.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Why?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Because it is the most stressful part of the job,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and the most difficult.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And of course,

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
all programmers try to avoid this positioning.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
And in order to somehow manage this moment,

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
and meet the needs of the company

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
in all three positions of programmers,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
it was necessary to develop special career paths,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
and to take this into account in career paths.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
We will talk about this a little later.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
As I said,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
the personal evaluation plays a special role in the planning of a career.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
And here on this slide we see the main blocks of personal evaluation,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
those qualities that are important to evaluate

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
from the point of view of planning a career.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
These are professional skills, management skills, and motivation.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
We refer to professional skills here

37:35.000 --> 37:41.000
what is related to the professional specialization of this employee.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
That is, for a programmer,

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
it can be the possession of certain programming technologies.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
For a lawyer,

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
it can be his specialization within a particular law.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
For a financier,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
it can also be their specialization

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
and their level of knowledge and skills

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
in a particular professional field.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
To evaluate professional skills,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
the expert assessment of the manager

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
or special professional tests are used most often.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
And of course, it is very convenient to use professional tests,

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
because they allow you to evaluate a very large number of people at the same time

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
using standard methods

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
and store this data in digital form.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
For example, as soon as a very large company

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
wants to evaluate a large number of one-profile specialists at the same time,

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
a professional test is usually developed

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
using external providers or internal specialists.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
And with the help of this test,

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
a mass assessment of the employees of these departments is carried out.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
The second big block of assessment is the assessment of management skills.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Here, this block is important for us

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
so that we can assess the management potential of this employee

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
and how much we can consider this specialist

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
for a management position in the near or distant future.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But there is such an aphorism

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
that if we promote a super professional at the level of a manager,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
we get a bad manager and lose a professional.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Of course, this is not always the case.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
Therefore, it is important to assess and assess a person's professional skills,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
his management potential and motivation.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
When it comes to management skills,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
it is worth noting that

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
if this employee is not yet in a management position,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
then we are unlikely to have the experience

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
to assess him from the point of view of his management skills.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
Here, in this case, you can give the employee a temporary project,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
a temporary working group

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
so that he can try himself as a manager

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
and so that his colleagues and managers can assess his management skills.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
In order to assess the management potential of a person,

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
the usual case methods, assessment centers or 360 interviews are used.

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
A very important point is the evaluation of the employee's motivation for his career.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
Each of us has faced strong professionals

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
who do not want to hear anything about a possible career,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
neither horizontal nor vertical.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
They have already reached a comfortable professional level for themselves,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
they occupy a certain position

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
and perform a certain circle of functions and bear a certain responsibility.

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
They are not ready to discuss the possibility of expanding their functions or growth.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
No matter how profitable it is for the company.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Here, of course, a special case.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
As we know, certain corporate cultures and a number of companies

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
confess the principle of either up or overboard

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
and simply physically fire employees who do not advance in their careers.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Or they create such conditions when such employees are forced to quit

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
because sitting in one place is not popular in these companies.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
But most companies are tolerant of such stars

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
who occupy a comfortable professional position for them.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
They are unique specialists and meet the needs of the company.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Such employees can be programmers at any age,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
when the company has already been addressed to them many times

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
on the topic of project management, management of departments.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
But they refuse to do this and occupy a comfortable position for themselves.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Companies have to make up with this,

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
if the interests of the company and the interests of the employees really coincide.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
But in other cases, there is already a special work.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
In this way, it is very important to evaluate three blocks in terms of assessment.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
Professional, management and motivation.

42:03.000 --> 42:11.000
Motivation that can seriously affect our understanding of career planning for this employee.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
Here, on the next slide, it is quite small,

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
but nevertheless, I tried to reflect the main issues

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
that we can discuss with a person for a career planning interview.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
In one of the companies, I managed to implement a holistic project on career planning,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
which was not initially associated with the organizational structure,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
not with the training and development block.

42:40.000 --> 42:47.000
Thus, we initiated a structured interview on career planning with each employee of the company.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
I can share with you such an emotional experience.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
It turned out that for most employees it was very important.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
They just said thank you for talking to them about their ambitions,

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
their professional motivation, about who they would like to be in a year or two.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
But I also had to touch on the questions about the past of employees,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
about how they grew up in their careers,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
what they consider the most important for themselves,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
what they are proud of.

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
Such a complete range of information allowed me to give recommendations to the company

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
about which direction we can develop this employee.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
On this slide, I highlighted the main questions,

43:35.000 --> 43:44.000
which, in my opinion, are the most informative and, perhaps, not quite banal for such communication.

43:44.000 --> 43:53.000
A career planning interview in a number of companies can be conducted with all employees of certain units,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
or all units.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
It can be tied to the evaluation of the results.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
In some companies, a career planning interview is conducted only with employees

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
who are included in the resource pool or, as they say, the high-po.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
These are high-potential employees,

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
on whom the company bets in the long term.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
It is considered correct and, perhaps, the most economical,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
if the company cannot afford to plan a career for all employees,

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
it is considered rational to plan it for at least the stars,

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
who have already shown themselves in the results of their work,

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
in the projects in which they participate or which they lead.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Such interviews are conducted with such employees.

44:44.000 --> 44:52.000
In our experience, there were cases when such an interview was provoked by the desire of a person to resign.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
When a person came to the manager with an application,

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
the manager sent this person to the department of work with the staff

45:02.000 --> 45:11.000
and asked us to offer some option to motivate a valuable employee to stay in the company.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
And then, of course, everything we talk about in terms of career planning,

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
everything applicable here, and the process begins with an interview on career planning.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
When we identify the interests of an employee,

45:24.000 --> 45:31.000
we talk to him about life, about what he likes in our company,

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
what possible prospects are.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
It is very important to expand the area of ​​discussion with the employee as much as possible

45:39.000 --> 45:48.000
so that he is not bound by hierarchy, not bound by organizational structure,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
but so that we can openly discuss with him in what directions he sees himself,

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
in what positions and in what directions it would be interesting for him to continue his career.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
And as a result of such a career planning, there can be very non-trivial organizational decisions.

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
When a person from one functional direction turns to a related or completely different direction.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
But we'll talk about this later.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
And the next slide shows us the stages of implementation.

46:21.000 --> 46:30.000
The stages of implementation are the stages suffered during the practical implementation of career planning projects.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
There are two very important points here.

46:35.000 --> 46:44.000
These are the first and second points, which say that it is important for us to identify internal experts

46:44.000 --> 46:51.000
who will give us formal and informal information, and also internal PR.

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
As you understand, as soon as we in the company declare that we will plan the career of an employee,

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
we launch such a project, then the employees have a moment of uncertainty.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
Some of them may think that the company will lose its career growth,

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
and therefore, if he does not want to move anywhere, he will be fired.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
Some employees, on the contrary, think that finally they will be able to bargain with the company

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
about the most attractive conditions for them.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Third employees, third categories, they may not know anything about it,

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
but they are in a state of uncertainty.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
As we understand, uncertainty is not the best state for work.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Therefore, this is the second point of internal PR of the project.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
It is very important to pay special attention to it.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Internal PR.

47:42.000 --> 47:51.000
It is important to agree with the management and publish on internal resources,

47:52.000 --> 48:02.000
on all possible information resources, the main values and the main importance of this project for the company and for the employees.

48:02.000 --> 48:11.000
Usually, the most painless for the organization is when we position the career planning project

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
as a tool for motivating employees, as a tool for training and development.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
This is the most universal wording, I would say, and the most understandable for employees.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
All employees, to some extent, dream that their company will train them,

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
of course, at their own expense and in their working hours.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
And the company can explain that in order to train you,

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
to plan training and development of training,

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
we need to understand your expectations, your ambitions, and plan for each career.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
This is a universal wording that shows that in this project,

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
the interests of the company, the interests of the employees are the same.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
And already the third point is when we start planning the project.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
Not earlier, as any action from the management of the staff, as we know,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
immediately strains the employees if they do not understand what we are talking about.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
And since career planning affects either certain departments or the company as a whole,

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
it is important to give people the necessary information as soon as possible,

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
and in the simplest and most understandable form.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
The next point is the creation of a career path map.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Further, the methodology of assessing the staff with clear indicators,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
what we talked about a little earlier, the assessment of the staff,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
the discussion of the results.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
And here is a very important point that, of course, we try to make career planning

49:43.000 --> 49:49.000
as objective as possible, and the methods of assessment, as the management requires from us,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
to be as objective and formalized as possible.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
But in reality, each company has a policy,

49:56.000 --> 50:04.000
and, as a rule, the results of the assessment become the subject of a discussion of the higher management

50:04.000 --> 50:11.000
about certain employees who are the most interesting and important to the company.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
Therefore, before performing any actions,

50:15.000 --> 50:23.000
usually the results of the evaluation of employees become the subject of a discussion of the higher management.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
And only after that we move on to the stage of feedback to the employee on the results of the assessment,

50:29.000 --> 50:37.000
career planning, what we discussed a little earlier, the very methodology of conducting an interview,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
and the norming of the labor payment matrix.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Here it is very important to norm labor payment relative to grades,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
and grades that are universal throughout the company,

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
but the labor payment matrix can vary from regions and from countries where certain units are located.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
But here is a very important point,

50:58.000 --> 51:06.000
that each employee will be able to compare himself with other employees based on the grade,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
and not on the basis of the salary, which depends on regions and on countries.

51:10.000 --> 51:19.000
And now we will discuss the mistakes that usually occur in companies in the area of career management.

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
The first mistake is the lack of career management function.

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
And on this slide we can see what problems the nature of the process leads to.

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
The nature of the process leads to the fact that we underestimate the ambitions and potential of the candidates we hire.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
As a result, the candidates either do not apply, the current trial period increases,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
the current staff during the first year of work,

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
the dissatisfaction of the employees with their position in the company,

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
and the resultativeness of their work decreases.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
The next point is extravagant HR decisions.

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
As we know, the management sometimes likes to change the positioning of a particular employee unexpectedly,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
including top managers.

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
They want to shift the position to a new one without discussing it with the employees.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Some managers, reasonably or not,

52:22.000 --> 52:32.000
believe that any promotion that is accompanied by an increase in the salary should be desirable by the employees.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
There is such a mechanistic approach,

52:34.000 --> 52:42.000
especially for the company owners, who believe that any HR decision is possible for money.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
We understand that in the reality of business, this is not always the case.

52:46.000 --> 52:56.000
In order to prevent mistakes of our management, it is very important to plan a career for the long-term and the most accurate.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
The third point is the financial losses of the company.

53:01.000 --> 53:08.000
If we talk about training, then some companies train everyone for everything or something,

53:08.000 --> 53:17.000
and as a result, if the training process and training plan are not connected with the planning of the career and with the strategic goals of the company,

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
then it is mostly wasted money.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
That is, it is not an optimal investment in training and development.

53:26.000 --> 53:34.000
Further, the consequences of the mistake of the absence of the function of managing the career are the uncontrollable struggle of the employees' ambitions,

53:34.000 --> 53:47.000
who try to prove to the management who is cooler, who is more worthy of promotion and increase in salary.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
As you understand, this does not increase the ability of the department to work.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
This affects the atmosphere in the team negatively.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
In order to keep the employees, we have to do it with a salary.

54:01.000 --> 54:10.000
As a result, the company's costs for the salary increase, which is also not optimal.

54:10.000 --> 54:17.000
In the next slide, we see the next problem, which is also related to the planning of the career.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
This is a lack of systematic.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
For example, in large companies, the planning of the career is done in one department,

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
training is done in another department, and the evaluation and adaptation is done in the next departments.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
Accordingly, these processes have an internal logic, but are not connected with each other.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
As a result, the management system itself loses its effectiveness.

54:43.000 --> 54:54.000
Here I tried to show how the planning of the career, which directly affects the personnel decisions,

54:54.000 --> 55:03.000
how all the functions of the staff management can be systematized and act in the system.

55:03.000 --> 55:11.000
The next mistake is the lack of management of ambitions.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
There are two possible situations.

55:17.000 --> 55:23.000
On the one hand, when an employee whose ambition the company did not notice in time,

55:23.000 --> 55:30.000
he somehow gets an offer from another company, usually competitors in the same industry,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
and leaves us.

55:33.000 --> 55:42.000
That is, he will now do his job in favor of our competitors, which is absolutely unprofitable for us.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
Or the employee, on the contrary, has low ambitions, and according to the logic of the company's development,

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
we start promoting it, because it initially seems to us, thanks to the stereotype,

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
that each employee is interested in promotion and salary increase.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
In practice, this is not the case.

56:01.000 --> 56:09.000
Some employees are ready to take their position, they have reached the balance of life and work to which they aspired,

56:09.000 --> 56:16.000
and therefore they do not dream of any promotion, and in addition, they will create obstacles.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
But depending on whether they can honestly say about it or not.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
How is this problem solved?

56:24.000 --> 56:31.000
This is the detailing of the career ladder with a clear system of requirements for all competences,

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
both professional and managerial, and with a clear attachment to the level of wage.

56:37.000 --> 56:47.000
Here is a pyramid, on which we see about 11 career levels in the company.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
This is an example of a consulting company.

56:51.000 --> 56:58.000
In consulting, almost all employees are the same, and do the same.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
But in order to keep the competence of the employee within the company,

57:03.000 --> 57:09.000
and in order not to overpay the beginners and retain more experienced employees,

57:09.000 --> 57:15.000
a very detailed career matrix is built.

57:15.000 --> 57:24.000
Here, as an example, I have given, and we see that in the company this matrix of 11 or 20 levels

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
can be assigned to the entire professional life of an employee,

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
and ideally, to keep him for the rest of his life in one company.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
This often happens in large global Western companies, as we know.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
And here, too, two situations are possible.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
A number of employees are not ready to wait until two years later, three years later,

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
and will be considered for the next career step,

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
and they simply go to other companies, and immediately take higher positions.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
But for another number of employees, on the contrary,

57:58.000 --> 58:05.000
they are close to such a career planning option as life in one company,

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
and work in one company, in one industry all their life,

58:08.000 --> 58:16.000
and then such a high career ladder is just adequate for their motivation,

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
for their promotion, for their life inside the company.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
We have already noted a point that is related to the fact that not always the ambitions of an employee

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
and the opportunities of a company for its promotion coincide.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
And, of course, most often, a special analytical work is necessary

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
in order to understand how within the framework of this organizational structure

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
our employees have the opportunities for career growth.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
And on this slide, I tried to reflect how we can solve this problem

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
as a violation of the business needs and ambitions of the employee.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
For example, we take all the adjacent departments

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
with the employee we are considering.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
In this example, this is the marketing department.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
Let's imagine that our employee, who is dissatisfied with his position,

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
is at the level of a specialist, and we, based on the results of his assessment,

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
have estimated that, yes, indeed, his knowledge and experience

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
are superior to the requirements of this position.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
But in the marketing department we do not see such opportunities for promotion,

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
as all the positions are occupied, as we see, by the head of the group and the head of the department.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
Then we begin to analyze all adjacent professional areas.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
In relation to marketing, this is CRM, working with clients, this is sales,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
and there can also be projects.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
And in these verticals we can see possible vacancies.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Thus, for this specialist, we can show that he has the opportunity

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
to rotate horizontally to other adjacent departments,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
in which he will gain new experience and new knowledge,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
which will later help him make significant progress in his career,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
depending on how much we evaluate his managerial potential and skills,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and how much he really wants to move in the management vertical.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
For a certain amount of time, such horizontal rotations

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
for the employees in adjacent departments can look very profitable.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:39.000
In this regard, the fact that the employee himself expands the area of his professional competencies,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and he perfectly understands that at the highest level,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
at which these functions are combined, for example, at the position of sales director,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
or PR and advertising director, all the knowledge that he receives at this first stage,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
passing the rotation in adjacent departments, these knowledge will be very important to him.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And if the employee really looks into the distant future,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
he will take our arguments with optimism and the opportunity to rotate to adjacent departments.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But on this example, I have given a very small slide in English,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
but this is not important at all.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The most important thing in this slide is logic.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The logic of career planning options.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000
When we show the requirements for the increasing grades in the first line,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
here TA stands for trainee analyst,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
the next level A1 is the analyst of the first level, the analyst of the second, third,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
and then the leading analysts of the first, second, third, and fourth grades.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
This is an example of career planning for programmers.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And in the first line, the main requirements for these grades are indicated, which are common.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
One or another logic of career development.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
The second line shows the professional logic of career development,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and the third line shows the management logic.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
As we can see, here we give programmers the opportunity to grow in professional level,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and also to start their management growth from the level of grade 3.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
A person can already take on more and more management functions,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and we show it to him in a special third line.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I can say that based on experience, when we discuss this topic with an employee

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and give a well-designed map of career paths,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
it makes a very positive impression on the employees,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
because they finally show their capabilities in this company in a clear form,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and the requirements are clearly shown, depending on the grade.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
As you know, there are such curiosities when we hire a little inexperienced employee.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The first three months, six months, we teach him energetically,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and it seems to him that he already knows everything in his field.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And here, a very cooling factor is that we show this employee,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
who already believes that he knows everything, and he is worthy of being transferred to a higher grade,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
we show him such a matrix of career paths and requirements for each grade.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And when we tell a person that he has studied these three technologies perfectly,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
which are necessary for this grade, but there are 15 technologies in the requirements of this grade,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
the company will give him the opportunity to rotate in projects or in units,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
during which he will have the opportunity to develop all his 10 other skills,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and thus, after some evaluation, we will be able to consider you for promotion to the next grade.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Thus, the information of employees plays a key role here,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
because if an employee does not have information, he may have inadequate ambitions.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
When we give information to a person, we show him the general rules of the game,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
we show him that these general rules are adopted by the higher management of the company,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and they work for each employee, not only for him.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And the whole logic of the development of colleagues is subordinate to these rules,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and this makes absolute clarity in this corporate game, in this corporate life.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And employees feel more confident on the one hand, and on the other hand, feel more protected.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000
The employee understands that only his efforts and his energy and initiative depend on his career progress.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And with the help of such a map, it is very effective to motivate employees to those projects,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
on which they would not have agreed with other information.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:26.000
For example, in this matrix, we have made such an important point as the need for each employee

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
to work in customer support before a certain grade.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And here we put it as a mandatory condition and justify to programmers that only by working in this function,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
in the function of customer support, they will acquire very important skills.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
First, they will better understand the needs of customers,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
they will better understand what mistakes customers most often face,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
they will better understand the code that they did not write,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
they will better learn how to work with this code optimally,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and find mistakes in it and correct them.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And this will play a role in the next attestation.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Thus, in such a detailed map of career paths,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
it is possible to achieve a combination of interests,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
on the one hand, the logic of the development of the employees themselves,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
the logic of the development of their ambitions, and the logic of the business needs.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Here, of course, business needs play a key role in this career path matrix.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
When it fits on one page, this is also a crucial point.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
When each employee can see the horizon of his development right on one page,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
this is very important for him, such an important, obvious, normal logic.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
And this document becomes open, and each employee understands what is required of him,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and what efforts he can make in order to advance in his career,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
and to have more arguments for the next interview,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
based on the results of his previous activity.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.000
In the next slide, we see that it is dedicated to the shortcomings of the personnel decision-making system.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
For example, no matter how well we plan the career of employees,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
if we do not have a decision-making tool and promotion of employees,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
such planning is rather provocative,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:39.000
because we include ambitions, we give hope to employees, but we cannot support them.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Thus, in order to connect the planning of the career with the adoption of management decisions,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
a unified information system works very well for this purpose.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
When all our employees and the organizational structure live in one software system,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and the management, when it has a need to consider or compare several employees,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
can identify the best candidate for promotion,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
the management can do it with just a few clicks of a mouse,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
get a comparative report on several employees,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and can make a management decision.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
In addition, this decision will be argued,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
because it will be based on objective factors.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Accordingly, this is the engine of the process of planning the career.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
In the next slide, I would like to reflect that different little things can play a very important role in planning the career.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
For example, during one assessment center,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
when we identified management competencies,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:52.000
various assessment tools were used, including tests and interview on competencies,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:03.000
we aimed to select the stars that we could recommend to management promotion based on objective factors.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The only thing is that in this company, which was global,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:16.000
promotion was associated with the need to change the place of residence, move to another region.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Yes, a person won a salary, and the company considered that this is a great happiness.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
If you are nominated for the stars,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000
you have such wonderful opportunities as moving to other regions with a salary increase and a position.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
During my interview, I was surprised to see a very strong candidate,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:56.000
who showed very strong results in various tests and objectively entered the category of stars.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
When I saw a very complaining expression on his face,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
our interview ended with him asking not to include him in the reservists,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
because he just doesn't want to change his place of residence.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Here he has relatives, here he has a big family, here his children study.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:23.000
He looked with such sadness and said that despite the fact that we spent so much time on him,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and indeed he is very strong in results, in his management potential, in his ability to learn,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:41.000
nevertheless, there was a banal household obstacle, that he just didn't want to change his place of work.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Therefore, he was not ready to move forward within the global framework.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Within the framework of this region, there was no opportunity for promotion,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
but this did not create any discomfort for him.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Thus, during this deep assessment, the company finally received information

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
that the person simply does not want to move forward for household reasons,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
for family reasons, otherwise it would not have known about it.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Also, in the next slide, I am talking about neglecting the context.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
The fact is that when we form a pool of reservists,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
we select stars using numerous assessment procedures,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and we attract a lot of attention to employees,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
we develop them, create individual development plans for them.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
This, of course, objectively causes some anxiety for the managers.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
The manager understands, either for objective or subjective reasons,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
that he will not be able to move forward in his career,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
or he is busy in a higher position,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and he naturally has anxiety about his high-potential employees.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
There are even cases when the management of the company's staff and management

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
does not control enough what is happening in the department,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
such high-potential employees easily receive offers from competitors,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and for them the direct manager creates a situation

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
when a person simply accepts another offer and leaves for another company.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Accordingly, this company has lost money,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
invested time in this employee, and it is already losing it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
How to overcome this obstacle?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Since the company is large, it has many departments, many enterprises,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
if not even enough enterprises,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
but we can say that the company is growing,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and therefore vacancies arise in different departments.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
If the company postulates that the employee is preparing,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and the company prepares him for the position of his direct manager,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000
and that a person can be prepared for a higher position in another department

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
or in another enterprise in another region,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
this usually relaxes the situation and removes the conflict of interests

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
of the direct boss and his high-potential employee.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Here, of course, the issue can be solved with the help of internal PR

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
and with the help of correct management decisions.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
When there are real personnel shifts from one department to another,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
between enterprises, only then the direct bosses will not feel the threat

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
from their high-potential subordinates.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
In the next slide, I describe another obstacle to the planning of a career

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
as a local interest.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
The fact is that the direct manager is least interested in the career of his subordinates.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Why? Because he simply does not want to lose a strong employee.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And, of course, here we immediately get this obstacle,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.000
that the directors themselves are far from always ready to give the management of the staff their stars

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
and point to them.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
On the contrary, they want to hide it and want to keep their employee in their department as long as possible.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But this is very unprofitable for the company,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
and this company is very likely to lose an ambitious employee.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And if the employee is not ambitious enough,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
then the company may lose the opportunity to develop this employee,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
expand its functionality and responsibility.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
This problem is solved by the fact that the project on managing personnel,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
on managing the career of a staff member,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000
it has a single center, becomes systematic and is managed independently.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
This is usually done by the management of the staff of HR or by an external provider.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
This business process is managed independently,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
all data is processed centrally,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
and it is very important that this process has a total and unyielding character,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
so that each manager understands that this is not only about his department,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
this process concerns the company as a whole.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Then the obstacles from the direct managers will not be able to be realized,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
despite the fact that they can be,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but nevertheless it will be more difficult to implement.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The next possible problem in planning a career is a narrow understanding of the process itself.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
If the company understands this only as promotion vertically,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
then there are two possible problems, as we have already said.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The first is promotion of a highly professional specialist without management competencies,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
or an obstacle from the boss in working with this employee,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
only because he feels that he has management ambitions.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Accordingly, the solution to this problem is postulating in the company

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and advertising, internal PR in the company,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
horizontal career, cross-departmental,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and vertical careers, but in cross-departmental.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
This helps to relieve unnecessary tension.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Artificial intelligence, but this is the next slide,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
shows us the problem that concerns a number of international ambitious companies,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
which, using different methods of corporate culture,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
specifically provoke competition among employees,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
specifically provoke their ambitions,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and create a trend for career promotion,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and anti-trend for long-term position.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
If this is based on the logic of business, then nothing can be done about it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.000
But if the logic of business does not contradict both fast careers and long-term position,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
it is very important to understand that both career and professional development

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
are possible within the same position,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000
but due to deepening of the functionality and expansion of powers,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.000
with adequate financial support.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Also, I will talk about another problem of career planning,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
which is the lack of responsibility for employees.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Here in the column we see that the responsibility of an employee lies in the plane of motivation,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
in the plane of updating his potential, both professional and managerial,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and in his real and professional personal efforts,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000
so that the employee overcomes obstacles in his professional development and in his managerial development.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Here, as a rule, even the efforts of HR or external coaches are needed,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000
coaching, as a deep consultation of an employee to reveal his personal potential,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
which is necessary for professional promotion.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
That is, it is the support of an employee in his professional growth.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
As we can see, most often now career growth, even managerial growth,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
it precedes personal growth of a person, personal development.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And we see top managers at 23 years old, at 25 years old,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
and the social experience of an employee is not enough here

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
so that he can effectively solve issues at such a high level.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Accordingly, here, on the part of the company, there can be help in the form of consulting, in the form of coaching.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And on the part of the company, the responsibility for the promotion of an employee is quality management of staff,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.000
it is adaptation, assessment, training, development, motivation and adoption of weighted personnel decisions.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
On the one hand, these decisions must be timely,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
they must be prepared by the logic of the employee, the logic of his development,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
the logic of his performance assessment,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and they must be made on time,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
before the employee's ambitions go too far from the company's capabilities.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So, now let's move on to the discussion of the specifics of the work of the training center

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
and how it is in the plane of career planning,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.000
how the training and development of employees in the company supports the process of career planning.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So, on this slide I want to show how the company's training is usually evolved.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So, at the first stage, the first stage of understanding the company and its needs in training,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:11.000
usually, they teach someone something on the initiative of the employees themselves or on the initiative of the manager.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
When there are no serious reasons for training, or they are formal,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
and the training is built absolutely spontaneously.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000
But this leads either to non-optimal costs for training, or to the fact that they are just unnecessary costs.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
At the second stage of the training system in the company,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000
usually, in a planned mode, all managers are asked what they need to teach their employees.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And this information is collected in the department of work with the staff,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and it is considered that this is already such a systematic approach to training.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But on this pyramid, we see that this is not so.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And even if the company, for example, wants to train and improve the sales skills of its sales department,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:10.000
this somehow helps to make training purposeful and investment in training also productive.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000
As we see in this pyramid at the third level, here the company already organizes its own training center.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Internal trainers are hired for internal training, external providers are attracted, tenders are held.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And thus, the company tries to make investment in training as effective and optimal as possible.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Topics are chosen on which it is optimal to use internal trainers.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Usually, this topic is related to sales and management for very large companies.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And only at the fourth level, a corporate university appears.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.000
A corporate university is a systematic training program for staff that affects almost all employees.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Even if we talk about packers, for example,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
packers can be trained in festive packaging or the most optimal packaging, and so on.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Here, the training system covers all employees and it is positioned depending on the positions and the needs of the company,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
the needs of employees at each position.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And at the fifth stage, a corporate culture of self-training organization is already formed,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
when different factors work at the same time.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Formalized corporate training center, training in the workplace, coaching,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and the value of a self-training organization that supports innovations, including staff management.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Thus, as you can see, the company has a lot to grow in training.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And you can evaluate at what level your company is now and what you need to do to move to the next level.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So, in the next slide, we see the training center and its connection with other staff management functions.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And we see here that all functions are very interconnected.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And the training center can serve not only the purpose of training,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
but it is also associated with the evaluation of staff, planning of a career, and adaptation of staff.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And the activities of the training center also depend on the life cycle of a person in the company.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
We know that at some positions, employees usually work for six months, a year.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
For the company, this is fair, for the business, this is fair.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And, accordingly, the training program for these positions is customized for this life cycle of an employee.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000
At some positions, the company is interested in the employee's longer life,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and then the training program and career planning are customized for this.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
In the next two slides, I will try to reflect the opportunities of a career,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000
both for employees who occupy their positions in production units and for office employees.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
For example, career paths even in production units,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:15.000
for example, where we have packers, components, logistics, warehouse specialists, controllers.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Career paths are also possible here.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
The only thing is the requirement for a particular position.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And here, in practice, it turns out that an employee who wants to move to a higher paid branch of career development,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
he needs to receive additional professional knowledge and skills,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
and carry out this transfer even with a decrease in the position.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
For example, a person from the position of a packer can switch to the position of a controller

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
only after studying certain software products on a computer.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And after learning to use a computer, such a transition is possible only with a decrease in the position.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
But the employee is going for it, he has ambitions to grow in a different career vertical

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and with other opportunities in salary.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And in the next slide, we can see a similar development of career paths, but for office staff.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Here, for example, I took a mixed branch.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
This is PR, work with clients, marketing, sales.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.000
As a rule, in the end, for each of these verticals, a person can grow to the position of a general director.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And possible rotations are very easy at the lower levels, at the levels of specialists, junior specialists,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
when an employee masters a very narrow area and must be a professional in it.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Further, possible rotations are already at the level of average management,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
when a person leads a branch.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And here, the knowledge of mixed branches also plays a key role.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And if we show an employee taking the position of a specialist,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.000
then his horizontal rotations, maybe even with a salary retention, without salary increase,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
they will help him to move faster along the vertical.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
After a while, this can be a very motivating and important point for employees.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The same possible parallel rotations for employees of accounting and finance departments, for example.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Inside HR, we saw that it is also possible to rotate functions.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And for almost every branch, you can find possible parallel movements,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
which will motivate employees, will give them a sense of novelty,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
will give them additional experience, additional skills.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And as a result, as employees often say, their capitalization in the labor market will increase.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
They will be able to sell themselves more expensively inside this company or inside another company.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:09.000
In this slide, I tried to reflect in detail how the tasks of the training center are set,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
and how they are tied to the stages of the career.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Here, as we can see, the career ladder is already unfolding in the plane of the training task and in the plane of those programs.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:34.000
This slide is important only in terms of the fact that the detailing of the training plans is very serious,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
and it is tied to the career plans.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Further, we can look at this slide in more detail.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
For example, an intern on the Internet sales of music discs.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000
We see what topics of programs are important for him, if he just joins the company, and the content of these programs.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
As we can see, at the level of an intern, for us, first of all, corporate adaptation of the employee is important,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
which we achieve with the help of adaptation training and professional adaptation.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000
At this stage, it is very important to give a person some minimum of skills and knowledge,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:21.000
but also so that a person can effectively express himself in a fairly narrow functionality,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
so that a person can feel the result of his work as soon as possible,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
that yes, he can, yes, he is recognized in this company.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And only after that, we gradually reveal to these employees how much more they need to learn in order to advance in their career.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
For example, here we see for a junior sales specialist of music discs,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
already a significantly larger range of programs that he must study.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
We see how many trainings he still has to go through.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And when we show the employee from the youngest position the entire vertical of development and all those topics that he has to learn,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:07.000
which he has to study on his way to the company, then this is also motivating for a person.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000
He understands that yes, this company is seriously related to a career, is seriously related to training,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and he has a place to grow and he has a perspective.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Well, in this slide we see how this is revealed in detail for a sales specialist of music discs.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Here is an experienced specialist, the head of the Internet sales group.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Here we can see that at the level of an experienced specialist,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:49.000
we already want some coaching skills from a person in relation to junior specialists.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Thus, we gradually grow the skills of a manager in a specialist.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And we let him try this function in order for him to decide for himself how much he is interested in being a manager or not.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:12.000
As we understand, in the vertical of sales, for us, as for the company, it is equally interesting as a person who just sells well and sells a lot,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
and sells more and more with each period.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:21.000
We are also interested in people who grow vertically and take management positions.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Accordingly, here we support both logic.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:36.000
And at a higher level, a person can take a position of the head of the sales department of music discs and DVDs.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:44.000
What problems can we encounter in the planning of a career in a company?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Well, managers are afraid of losing valuable specialists as a result of their rotation to other departments,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
so managers can objectively slow down the development of an employee,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:00.000
can hide some information and can interfere with the rotation in one way or another.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Managers themselves are very painfully reacting to the unification of the budget for training and its management by HR,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
from the side of staff management.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
If before that managers were used to the fact that each of them independently decides whom to teach,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
then with the centralization of this budget, plans are developed centrally,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
and here they, of course, lose this freedom, this opportunity to teach each employee at their discretion.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:37.000
If within the framework of HR, the functions are very differentiated,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and the training specialists, they rarely agree with their actions with career development specialists,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
here it is clear that the company also loses efficiency.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And also, if the company does not have a normal software system,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:01.000
which would allow to receive management information on time and use it for management decisions,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
then here the company also loses.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Well, on this slide I have reflected at least four such global obstacles along this path.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
In conclusion, this slide shows, I would like to illustrate to him,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
that the planning of a career and the process of training and development,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
they should go side by side and should support each other.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It is then that the company receives the greatest return from the investment in this process.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Thank you for your attention.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I hope the complexity of this topic did not scare you.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.000
You have seen how many stages each company can go through in planning a career and in training and development.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
You have seen to what extent the career and training can be planned in detail.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That is, now we understand what we can aspire to,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and how optimal it is to use our investments for the benefit of business development,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
and how we can achieve the synergy of business interests and the ambitions of employees.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I wish you success on this difficult path.
