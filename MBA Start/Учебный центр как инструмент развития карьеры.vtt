WEBVTT

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.980
Good day.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.960
My name is Varlamova Eugenia.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
I have 15 years of experience in

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
the field of human resources management

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.080
and have successfully implemented

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.220
projects in companies such as

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.400
Eastline, Domodedovo International

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.300
Airport, Azone online

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.520
store, international IT company

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.900
CarTech Limited and currently work

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.340
as the HR Director of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.740
the Investment Finance Group

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.020
Theme Corporate Training Center

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.400
as a career planning tool.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.220
As you know, our managers and investors

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.640
are already so advanced

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.400
that the arguments about managing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.740
personnel, which lie only

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.080
in the plane of raising wages

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.620
and material motivation of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740
social packages, they no longer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.700
work.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.080
And our management is interested

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.700
in soft tools of motivation and

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.840
retention of staff, such as

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.100
training, career planning.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.940
This argument now works very

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.260
well for both employees and candidates

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.620
we want to attract to

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.900
the company.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.500
Business, unfortunately, is now

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.280
growing more slowly than the salary

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.080
level in Russia, and therefore

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.640
we really have no way

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.700
out but to apply soft tools

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940
in retaining and attracting

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.140
personnel.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.000
In my experience, candidates have been talking

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520
less recently about the possibilities

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.320
of salary, the possibilities

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.600
of the social package, about the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.960
planned increases.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.620
They are more likely to talk

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.780
about their careers, the positions

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.100
they will be in from the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.900
beginning.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.480
And what opportunities in terms

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.060
of responsibility and in terms of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.400
responsibility they will have.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.940
What opportunities in terms of careers

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.920
the company offers for the next

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.440
six months, for a year, for two

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.180
years and for more distant prospects.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.460
It is precisely how we and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.640
you will build the careers

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.780
of our employees, show them the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.760
horizons of their growth in our

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.280
company, it depends on how much

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.720
money we will actually spend

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.740
on our employees, what level of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980
salary we will offer them and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.660
how long we will successfully

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.980
cooperate with our employees.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.260
So today we’ll talk about

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.060
how we can plan the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.080
career of our employees

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960
and how career planning

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.540
is linked to all

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.880
other HR functions.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.040


00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.360
And today the most important emphasis

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.980
will be on the training center, the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160
corporate university and all possible

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.320
methods of training of personnel

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.760
as the main mechanism of career

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.840
development.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.500
So, I’ll tell you a little bit,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.480
about the company in which

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.240
we most promoted this project

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.200
about career planning itself,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.340
what it is and the corporate

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.500
university system,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.580
how a corporate university

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.660
and all the training and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.120
staff development methods

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.840
can work on career

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.060
planning.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.000
In high-tech companies,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.200
special attention is paid

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.060
to candidate and career

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.340
growth.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.400
Career growth we mean not only

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.960
horizontal development, which

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.300
is often limited, because,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.280
as we know, in recent times

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.020
the most fashionable

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.200
is a flat organizational

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.140
structure, in which

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140
only a few levels,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.180
3, 4, 5 levels.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.780
Thus, the vertical opportunities

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.140
for career growth are

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.960
quite limited.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480
Thus, each HR gets such a creative

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.820
task, in what way, without breaking

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.860
the organizational structure

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.120
of the company, to show,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.160
however, to each employee the possibilities

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.840
of his professional growth and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.420
motivate him precisely

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.320
by the content of the work,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.340
not so much salary and not

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.980
so much by the title of positions.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.910
Basic principles of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.070
career planning.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.230
We declare the value of training and

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.210
development of staff, and these

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.810
positions can be described from

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.870
the ass of the company, that is,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.910
before a person became our employee.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.950
In the job offer we not only write

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.330
a compensation package,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.490
but also pay special attention to

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.790
the opportunities for training

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.230
of employees, the possibilities

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.690
of his career growth, and

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.790
with some candidates we are already

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.910
in the negotiation stage, until

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.810
the candidate is our employee,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.030
we agree on what real

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.390
promotion in his position

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.350
he can get during the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.030
first year of work.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.430
In the further future, our candidates

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.910
in Russia do not often look, but

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.890
it is very important for them that

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.450
we as a company can offer them

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.890
during the first job, in

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.870
the event that our cooperation will

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.190
develop positively, we

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.250
will be happy with the employees

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.190
and they will be happy

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.890
with their work.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.510
It is very important to find out

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.630
at the stage of the interview with the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.910
candidate, when we are not

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.430
yet bound by any formal obligations with

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.170
each other, the level of his ambitions.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.850
At this point, we can expect that

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.050
the candidate will be able to

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.770
reveal more of his ambitions, his

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.390
interests, since he is not yet stuck

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.050
with any employment relationship

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.670
with the employer.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.210
It is at this point that it is important

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.290
to identify and specificate its

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.210
ambitions, because if we take an employee

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.090
with high ambitions for the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.470
position that does not

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.570
imply serious career growth,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.250
then you and I will lose the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.290
company's money and lose

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.430
time to employees.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.610
Thus, it is at the time of the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.790
interview that it is very important

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.650
to discuss many psychological

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.490
details that will show us, as

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.290
HRs, how a successful career

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.450
of this employee can develop

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.450
in the company.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.990
For example, if we take, we

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.690
consider a candidate for a accountant

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.050
position, but he tells us during

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.350
an interview about his

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.610
professional dreams in finance.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.090
He wants to be a financial

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.910
analyst, and in 5-10 years he wants to

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.190
take the position of financial director.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.790
And we and you understand that in

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.770
the next two years he is unlikely

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.310
to be able to get such a promotion in

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.110
the company, it is better, of course,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.030
at the stage of the interview honestly

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.090
tell the candidate about it and

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.390
look for a candidate for this position,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.130
who has less ambitions, with whom we

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.910
will have less headache, as soon as

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.310
he will take this place and we will

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.750
and will enter into employment

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.350
relations with our company.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.110
Planning a career depends very

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.970
much on the position we take

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.750
a person, and on his ambition,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.110
on his personality.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.030
These details can be clarified

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.430
in the interview.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.650
Also in companies, as a

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.350
rule now in most companies,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.010
annual or even quarterly

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.190
evaluation of the results

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.970
of the workforce, so-

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.210
called key performance indicators.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.550
And it is very important to position

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.130
that the performance of the employee

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.850
will have a serious impact on his

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.050
career planning and on the

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.590
possible promotion.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.770
Employees themselves most often associate

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.110
the assessment, which in some companies

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.270
is called the certification, with

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.350
the payment of bonuses, with the

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.850
increase in salary and rarely think

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.990
that it will affect their career the

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.050
participation of the HR manager in

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.650
such interviews in the assessment

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.870
interview on the assessment of personnel

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.730
is very important because it is

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.310
in this interview in this assessment

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.770
assessment conversation of the

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.210
manager with his subordinate and

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.410
may reveal some dissatisfaction

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.790
to employees regarding

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.970
his current functional,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.670
current responsibilities.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.330
And new ambitions may appear, something

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.610
we did not see in him, for example,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.850
six months ago.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.570
The world is changing very quickly, business

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.330
is changing very quickly.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.310
Our company is in a very energetic,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.990
changing environment.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.130
And so the ideas of employees, their

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.430
thoughts, their ambitions, they

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.650
can change very energetically too.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.090
And once a quarter, once every six

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.030
months, it is precisely the period

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.850
when it is important to understand

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.830
where the employee has progressed,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.870
how much he arranges the company, where

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.770
he can be more efficient,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.630
what additional functionality he

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.330
is ready to perform and choose

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.650
responsibly for himself.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.770
And I would also usually recommend that

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.970
an employee’s performance

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.390
assessment interview include

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.170
a very important block of planning,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.870
training and development.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.710
Special forms of an individual development

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.310
plan can be used when we discuss

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.390
with the employee not only his/

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.590
her results for the past

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.410
period, but also his/her plans for

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.850
the next period, including

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.250
in terms of responsibilities

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.570
and functions.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.750
And this is the best time to talk

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.170
to him about the company’s opportunities

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.290
for his training and

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.790
development.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.870
When we speak of training, already

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.330
looking at the training plane, we

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.290
can say that very often now candidates

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.510
are asked in the jeep to write

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.230
down what responsibility the company

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.430
is ready to take on the stage

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.690
of negotiations with the future

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.710
employee about his training.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.830
So, for some employees for certain

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.490
positions, we can even write

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.090
that the company during the

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:14.610
first job necessarily trains

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.830
employees on such topics,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.570
on such courses.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.990
And for job candidates now it has become

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.710
very significant, especially those positions

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.810
that are associated with a certain

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.730
level of certification, such as

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.050
the financial sector, HR also

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.650
often put this as an important

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.810
condition.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.550
Technicians and programmers.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.650
And here it is a very serious

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.970
signal that indicates that this

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.190
candidate takes his career

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.170
seriously.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.690
He has certain plans, and he considers

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.630
work in our company not

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.490
just as banal employment

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.570
and making money in the

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.710
plane, the development

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.150
of his career.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.170
And here, of course, it is also important

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.270
for us to ask him in more detail

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.710
what he has in terms of his future

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.170
professional and

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.290
to assess from the employer’

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.070
s point of view how long we

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.650
and this employee can be

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.330
interesting to each other.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.650
In my experience, it makes sense

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.650
to talk about the horizon

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.850
of planning for no more than two

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.470
years.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.650
Usually, candidates are in a

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.410
relationship with a new employer.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:37.890
And from the point of view

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.530
of us as employers, this is also

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.410
a quite comfortable period, for

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.090
which we can at least verbally

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.810
get the candidate willing to work

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.030
in the company and promote in

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.590
our company.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.230
But I usually describe it in words

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.650
that you understand, your

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.290
company will invest your time,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.830
your experience and you will work

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.030
with colleagues who will

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.370
share their experience,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.210
with you technology.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.110
The company has some very serious

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.150
technological developments,

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
and therefore for us as a

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.990
company, it would be important

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.430
that you plan your employment

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.710
with us for at least

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.730
two years.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.950
And only in this planning

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.230
horizon can we discuss with

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.310
you our responsibilities as an employer

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.090
with regard to career

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.790
planning and with regard to your

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.670
education.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.590
As a rule, this type of planning

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.550
horizon is comfortable for both the

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.410
employee and the company.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.070
In reality, this period is not

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.310
always sustained.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.070
Some employees, to our pleasure,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.150
work significantly longer,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.450
and with some employees

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.730
we have to break up

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.530
for quite objective reasons.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:55.110
It is very important that training

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.970
plans are not just down from the top down,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.250
as a big project of the company, but

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.370
to engage in training, and to engage in

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.790
discussion of the training needs

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.190
of employees themselves.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.030
And we do this in a variety

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.550
of ways, using all the possible

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.590
reasons for it.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.610
Starting with the admission, when we

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.430
are to identify the interests

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.090
of candidates, including asking such

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.810
a question as, and what you would

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.550
like to learn more, what training

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.850
you would like to go through, what

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.170
you think you could be interesting

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.050
and would help your effectiveness

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.610
in work.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.850
Also all interviews when evaluating

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.710
and assessing employees, assessing their

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.650
performance, they can also serve the

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.710
purpose of building training plans

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.370
and human development.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.090
But here it is very important

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.250
to prevent such, I would say, consumer

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.570
attitude of the company’

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.810
s employees.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.710
When an employee actively pedals the topic

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.170
that the company should train him,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.970
the company should promote him,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.310
it is very important to shift the

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.690
emphasis and emphasize that the company

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.450
also expects from the employee

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.590
his efforts, his professional

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.870
efforts, his self-learning.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.970
Learning is a mutual process,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.410
not a one-way process.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.390
And in order to strengthen

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.010
the responsibility of the employee,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.830
we, before expensive training, of

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.810
course, conclude a student contract

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.070
with the person.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.050
And, in addition, we show in a

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.830
special format, show how one or

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.930
another training, one or

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.750
another training should affect

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.670
the effectiveness, the effectiveness

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.710
of the work of the employee.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.330
The core for the career planning

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.730
system and for the learning

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.090
system is, of course, the corporate

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.050
model of competences.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.070
In this slide you can see an example

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.110
of this model.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.670
It consists of 10 competences.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.750
Each company can be different.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.790
Competence models can depend on

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.690
specific positions, can be developed

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.510
individually for each group

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.030
of positions, or can be a general

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.890
corporate model.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.730
It depends on how much time

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.430
HR has to develop it and on at

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.510
least one corporate

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.990
model of competences, which depends

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.210
on the level of employee position,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.790
on their professional

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.210
specialization, it should,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.570
of course, be.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.110
And here you see a 10-competence

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.730
competence model, which is developed

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.310
specifically for a high-tech

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.810
company working in the

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.870
field of e-commerce.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.850
The industry of the company leaves a very

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.350
large footprint and has a very strong

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.770
influence on the composition of competences.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.810
As you can see, special attention

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.390
is paid to innovation, positive

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.330
thinking, positive communication.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.050
This suggests that in an innovative

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.170
company, an innovative industry,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.030
the competences are very important,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.470
which determine the style of

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.150
communication of employees with

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.710
each other and determine

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.870
the nature of their work.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.890
What is very important for a

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.270
company is that people

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.410
are innovative, that

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.050
they feel free to make

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.690
decisions and share ideas

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.810
with each other.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.410
And here you see very important competencies,

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.090
positive thinking, positive

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.290
communication.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.130
It is about people and employees

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.250
to be able to share ideas

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.930
with each other and organize

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.010
working groups to discuss

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.710
problems or to discuss

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.990
problem areas in order to

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.650
jointly develop a group

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.710
solution, group ideas.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.850
And here, you see that there

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.630
is a special competence in teamwork,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.790
business thinking, and first

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.830
of all, of course, professionalism.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.490
Professionalism depends on

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.230
the professional field in which

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.470
a person works.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.650
I would say that this

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.010
is a universal competence.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.830
And here the manager himself, he evaluates

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.870
the employee how much his level of knowledge

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.830
and level of experience corresponds

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.890
to the needs of the company.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.010
In the next slide we can see

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.670
an example of a form of evaluation

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.030
for key performance indicators.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.550
This is a form that is used in employee

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.430
performance assessment

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.150
events, which, as I said,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.450
takes place once a quarter,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.690
once every six months or

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.150
once a year depending on the company.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.190
And here is a very important

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.290
point that every goal that we put

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.810
before a person for the next

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.290
period of work, it must be

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.750
prescribed, it must be weighed,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.190
it must be assigned a certain

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.470
weight, a certain

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.770
importance.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.710
And we must tell the employee what

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.750
exactly the result we expect from

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.670
him, at what level.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:13.530
And the most important employee himself,

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.890
and as a result after a certain period

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.030
of time, it is a quarter of six

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.770
months or a year, the employee and

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.350
the manager meet again, and they have

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.390
a wonderful opportunity to assess

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.450
what goals have been achieved, achieved

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.330
at the expected level, what

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.690
goals have been achieved at a

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.250
level below the expected,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.630
what goals have not been

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.170
achieved and for what reason.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.890
And it is a great opportunity also

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.190
to assess what we are, what we have

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.530
not achieved, what has prevented

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.270
us and what plans in training and

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.710
development we can offer

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.090
to the person here.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.010
That is, what we as a company can offer

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.250
an employee in terms of improving

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.810
his knowledge, improving his experience,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.730
his professional competencies.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.430
On the other hand, the employee

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.230
himself, he too, should think about

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.730
it and, as a rule, employees

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.410
in a few weeks are already preparing

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.910
for the procedure

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.250
for assessing their performance

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.050
and the company is undergoing

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.370
special training when we train

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.910
managers how to make feedback

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.370
on the results

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.470
of performance assessment

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.990
and we train employees

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.130
themselves how to most

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.010
fruitfully use this wonderful

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.330
opportunity.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.070
And here on the next slide we can

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.890
see just the simplest format,

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.930
which is also used as the

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.210
outcome of the interview

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.270
on the results of the work of employees.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.830
There is an individual training plan.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.070
Here we write what the purpose

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.250
of training, why we want to train the

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.750
employee, the training plan, the

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.530
subject, the timing of what results we expect.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.130
In addition, you can also

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.710
make a column here on what

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.810
competence will work for the

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:07.710
training.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.950
This allows us to plan

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.550
more accurately for staff

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.010
training.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.710
These forms after the evaluation are

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.850
handed over to the training center,

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.490
and the training center can already

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.650
assess the company’s training

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.010
needs and schedule training

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.470
for the next effective

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.090
use of such formats in electronic

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:31.990
form.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.390
There are already many human resources

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.830
management programs that allow

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.210
you to automate the process of

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.950
performance assessment

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.450
and planning, as well as

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.470
career planning.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.990
Now let’s talk about

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.050
planning a career.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.030
From the perspective of employees,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.570
career planning is usually

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.710
a company’s obligation.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.070
What jobs the company is

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.730
obliged to offer on a certain

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.730
time horizon.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.010
But from the point of view of HR

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.730
and from the point of view of the

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.650
company, career planning is the definition

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.650
of a clear prospect of

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.150
his professional development within

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.170
the strategic development of

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.210
the company.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.490
This is a very important moment, as

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.130
we plan the career of our

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.950
employees not only based on their ambitions,

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.630
their professional desires,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.710
plans.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.450
But first of all, of course, in

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.650
terms of the company’s strategic plans.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.850
You can give such an example here.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.570
For example, in one IT company, where

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.910
the main staff is software

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.950
programming and implementation, when

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.070
the company changed its

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.290
strategy and changed the focus of

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.650
its activities from software development

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.890
to implementation, we conducted

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.750
a special interview with each

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.690
programmer on the subject

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.790
of his interests, his ambitions,

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.830
used leverages, different

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.650
techniques, in order to

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.390
help the second programmers

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.730
realize how much they would

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.570
be interested, what would be

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.690
interesting to them not only

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.690
to program and work with code,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.510
but also to work with the

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.950
client and with the implementation

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.770
of software

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.910
products.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.390
Of course, we understand

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.870
the limitations of this approach,

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.010
that there are programmers who do

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.370
not want to see the client in

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.970
principle, but there is also a certain

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.770
number of programmers who are ready

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.250
to consider the opportunity to

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.470
work with clients over a certain

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.150
time horizon and can see how

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.270
the client’s work on implementing

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.950
software products promotes

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.590
them professionally.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.690
And here it is very important just

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.690
for us, as HR, to argue this position,

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.770
which is very important for

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.030
the company, and can also be beneficial

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.670
for employees themselves,

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.710
because they will be able to further

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.050
develop within the company and

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.010
develop their professional

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.570
skills and knowledge.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.750
That is, our main goal in career

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.230
planning is to create a synergy

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.030
of the interests of the company

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.910
and the employee, which is

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.410
achieved through numerous negotiations,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.010
numerous interviews and

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.130
the most numerous methods

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.450
of personnel management.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.610
Thus, with the help of

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.470
career planning, we solve several

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.530
tasks at once.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.950
It is not a material motivation.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.030
It would seem paradoxical,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.790
but nevertheless, thanks simply

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.030
to the fact that the HR manager,

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.570
the employee’s head,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.910
once a quarter and once a half

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.070
year, speaks to the employee

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.270
and discusses his ambitions.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.730
His professional goals, his needs

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.870
for training and development, only

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.690
this fact, he already reduces

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.750
the tension in the team and he gives

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.850
employees a sense of a clearer

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.830
perspective of his professional

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.290
path in the company.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.230
This has a significant impact on motivation.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.790
We also a decrease in fluidity

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.430
through career planning because

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.970
employees who see their prospects

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.790
in the company are less

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.930
likely to go to competitors

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.150
as they see their opportunities

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.810
with us.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.670
In addition, employees work

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.330
more energetically,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.130
more motivated, that is, at

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.850
the same time with the same

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.530
resources we greater results.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.170
So I would say that career

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.930
planning is such a universal

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.350
tool and a very powerful

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.410
tool.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.270
The only point is that, of course,

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.710
there are certain resources needed

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.990
here, and on the next slide we

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.590
can see such a pyramid that

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.110
shows how different companies

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.330
are moving towards this

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.090
topic.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.430
At the first level, the number

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.010
K1 shows that many companies think

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.110
about planning a career only

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.490
when the employee already

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.030
comes up with his statement and

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.670
says about his intention to

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.870
leave the company, then the boss

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.290
calls the HR manager and says

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.790
listen well you talk to him,

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.930
maybe you offer him something

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.390
or let us think together, it

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.610
is such a natural solution

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.950
to the problem of career

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.770
planning.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.270
Furthermore, the second stage of management

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.890
after a certain number of such

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.750
cases when employees want to

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.150
leave, but the reasons are not

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:36.050
only money, but also career prospects.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.890
The leader sets us a goal.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.170
Let us describe how our employees

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.110
can develop within

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.510
the company.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.310
In fact, this is such a very complex

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.550
technological work, very difficult,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.830
it is very important to analyze

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.150
the entire organizational

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.310
structure taking into account that

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.930
employees can grow in their

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.370
careers not only in their management

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.490
vertical, but it is also important

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.030
to highlight entire blocks

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.710
of organizational structure,

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.390
within which employees can change

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.510
their positions and move from

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.470
one division to another.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.410
For example, it was once very surprising

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.290
for us that Western companies

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.730
changed their specialization

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.390
to a HR manager every two

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.470
years to keep the HR manager

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.850
inside the company.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.270
In the management of personnel

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.030
there are many different and very

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.950
serious differentiated functions,

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.090
such as wage management, compensation

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.250
management or management

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.450
of training development or

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.630
recruitment.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.810
These are completely different directions, they

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.930
require different qualifications and different

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.770
experiences.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.890
But Western companies went on

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.270
to change and offer HR a new specialization

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.270
every two and a half or two years.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.470
And this achieved the goal, that the

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.550
HR manager, the interest of the HR manager

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.130
remained within the company, he

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.490
worked longer than other companies,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.550
where the specialization

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.090
did not change.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.330
Additional costs for the

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:13.850
company.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.070
The company trains, conducts

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.130
special training, loses efficiency

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.790
at the time of developing

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.150
a new employee into a new function

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.810
for him, but nevertheless the task

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.990
of the integrity of the

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.570
team, the preservation of corporate

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.610
competences is achieved, since in

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.770
large companies, not so much

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.570
professional competences

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.810
are important as corporate

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.270
competences.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.650
That a person owns all the subtleties,

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.190
all the values of the company.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.410
This allowed employees

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.210
to stay longer, significantly.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.310
And only in the third stage,

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.750
here you see the yellow figure.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.740


00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.100
Here, in the third phase, the function

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.940
of career planning is already developing

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.000
and becomes a full-fledged function

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.620
of human resources management.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.540
This is related to other human

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.320
resource management functions.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.280
Career planning is

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.980
primarily related to training

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.640
and development of staff.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.500
But this is not the highest horizon

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.740
that the company can reach in

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.400
this area.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.820
So, in the fourth phase, the company is

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.080
already even more clearly matching this career

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.320
planning functionality with all the rest

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.160
of the human resources management

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.860
functionality.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.460
It is connected with the corporate

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.400
training center.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.580
And at the top stage of career planning

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.900
in the company We already see career

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.200
planning as a value, corporate value

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.960
of the company, and what is commonly

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.180
called self-learning

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.640
organizations.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.560
A self-learning organization that

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.620
is impregnated with the cult

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.780
of coaching, when every new employee

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.380
or employee who is transferred to another

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.260
position has a special coach who

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.240
will help him overcome both personal

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.320
and professional barriers

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.920
in the new position and a culture

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.000
of development, when training

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.060
is done not only in the training

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.420
classes, not only at the

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.100
out-of-the-job seminars,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.240
but also simply at the workplace.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.620
So, as you can see, at least

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.680
5 stages by which a company

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.400
can grow and develop its

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.300
attitude to career planning.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.140
The key elements of a career

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.500
are key competencies.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.760
That is, when we discuss with you we

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.500
are not talking about positions and

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.160
not about money that is associated with

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.880
these positions, but first of all of

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.160
course about the key competences and the

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.440
level of their development of the employee.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.940
How much his competence profile

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.380
corresponds to the profile

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.380
of the position, what is the GP,

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.240
what key competences he has not

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.100
yet developed and how the

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.720
company can help in this,

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.200
what training and development

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.540
plan the company can offer.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.680
Also the second element, as seen

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.980
on this slide, is a very important

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.060
slide, in my opinion, the

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.900
second element of career planning

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.940
are career path options.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.000
It is just an intellectual

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.040
product of HR and managers,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.760
which will show how within this

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.000
organizational structure

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.680
each employee can grow in

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.780
their career in their professionalism.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.660
Career paths, we will show

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.360
it separately, they should be related

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.000
to the business logic, not

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.460
just the logic of employees’

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.680
ambitions.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.440
And the third point of career planning

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.260
is the effort of the employee himself.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.180
We emphasize during the interview.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.200
An interview can be on

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.300
career planning or an interview on

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.000
performance assessment or on an

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.580
individual development plan.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.580
In this interview, we focus

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.720
the employee’s attention on

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.900
what efforts are needed

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.400
to develop the key competencies

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.020
that are needed for

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.440
the next step in his career

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.680
growth.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.530
And here, as I said, in the next

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.430
slide we can see what a career looks

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.270
like from the employee’s

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.270
point of view.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.150
The employee sees that here are the following

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.110
positions and the following salary levels,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.550
the next power, the status in the company,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.370
the place in the hierarchy.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.670
From the company’s point of view,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.690
as we see in the next slide,

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.530
the career path of employees

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.910
looks a bit different.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.290
It is very important for the

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.890
company to receive a new level of responsibility

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.910
from the employee, a new level

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.270
of development of key competencies

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.530
at each next position, and the

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.350
company wants to see what effort

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.930
the person is willing to

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.070
apply in order to develop

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.870
himself in accordance with the

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.550
requirements of the next

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.750
career stage.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.610
How does the company manage the career?

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.710
This slide shows such a simple

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.150
scheme, but it is very visible.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.950
So, we evaluate employees, evaluate

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.430
staff, evaluate the performance

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:35.790
of employees, evaluate

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.850
their competence.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.150
The next point is the career

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.230
options that we can offer a person.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.970
It is usually a professional

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.470
career or a management career,

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.550
and a learning system that

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.050
will support this remarkable

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.170
process.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.170
In this slide, I tried to reflect

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.250
the stages of building a career

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.410
planning system.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.250
From my experience, this is built

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.710
in such a way that the structure, as is

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.930
known in companies, is not always reflective

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.110
of the real specifics of business

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.410
and the real business process.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.490
The body structure can become

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.010
obsolete, it can be in a constant

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.270
state of change.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.470
Therefore, here, rather to

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.710
plan and create career paths,

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.750
it is better to rely not on formal

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.490
documents, but on communication

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.910
with managers.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.050
And when we ask managers very simple

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.010
questions, but here is how the career

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.730
of employees usually develops,

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.130
but here are the employees

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.330
you have the most successful, in

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.470
your opinion, and how they made

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.710
their career, from which

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.390
units they came to you, into which

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.050
units their career can further develop,

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.670
so you will informally get information

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.050
from managers about the real

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.430
logic of the development of

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.990
the career of employees, which

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.590
has already emerged at the moment,

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.150
which the company in

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.450
general may even sometimes

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.130
not guess.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.650
The second point in creating a career

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.390
planning system is the creation

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:15.450
of evaluation tools.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.490
The evaluation tool is a competence

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.550
model and how we measure

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.050
those competences.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.850
It can be an assessment

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.850
center, it can be expert assessments,

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.110
it can be a structured interview,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.910
anything, everything that

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.650
matches the specifics of

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.130
the industry and the specific

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:37.530
competence.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.370
Furthermore, individual career growth

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.850
plans are developed, implemented

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.990
and as a result a training system

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.750
is created that supports this career

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.470
planning, a system of career

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.890
planning in the company.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.610
As you can see, the stages

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.610
are very serious, intellectual

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.330
and organizational.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.370
The whole process can take from six

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.030
months to one and a half two years.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.530
It all depends on the motivation of

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.450
the managers themselves, on the inclusion

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.610
of managers, and on how the

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.790
company evaluates the relevance

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.230
of this system.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.310
But here, for example, to the question

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.090
that most information can be obtained

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.330
only informally, you can give,

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.410
for example, such an example.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.290
In one IT company, like in many

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.590
others, all programmers were

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.250
divided into three blocks.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.530
This is self-programming, service

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.550
desk as customer service and

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.650
implementation.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.610
Three large

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.330
units, three large units.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.070
And since both employees change

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.490
and managers change periodically,

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.530
getting full insight

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.330
into how employees

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.890
usually do careers was

00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:59.950
not easy.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:02.690
And only by communicating with

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.170
the key employees who work the longest

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.730
in the company, and with managers,

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.590
it was possible to understand that

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.730
depending on the interests and

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.210
ambitions of employees, career planning

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.850
can be very different.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.930
For some employees, it is more

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.930
interesting to communicate

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.970
with customers, so they try to get

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.650
to the implementation department

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.490
in all ways.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.350
Some programmers don’t want to know

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.050
anything about the client, and then

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.790
they position themselves in

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.170
the development department.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.590
And the less popular, so

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.950
traditionally less popular part,

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.530
is the service why, as this is of

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.290
course the most stressful part

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.030
of the job and the most difficult,

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.710
in fact.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.430
And of course, this

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.070
positioning all programmers

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.470
try to avoid.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.390
And in order to somehow break

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.970
this moment and meet the

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.730
needs of the company in all three

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.370
programming positions,

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.050
it was necessary to develop

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.630
special career paths and

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.510
take this into account in

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.290
the career paths, which

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.810
we will talk about a

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.110
little later.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.610
As I said before, the evaluation

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.130
of staff plays a special role

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.550
in career planning.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.150
And here on this slide we see the

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.850
main blocks of evaluation of personnel,

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.630
qualities that are important

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.770
to evaluate in terms of career planning.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.550
These are professional skills,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.690
management skills and motivation.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.430
To professional skills we

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.570
here refer to what relates to

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.850
the professional specialization

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.130
of this employee.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.050
For a programmer, this can be the

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.470
possession of certain

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.070
programming technologies, for a lawyer,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.610
it can be his specialization

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.790
within a certain legislation,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.430
for financiers, it can also

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.150
be their specialization and their

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.850
level of knowledge and skills

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.930
in a particular professional

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.310
field.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.270
For the evaluation of professional

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.770
skills, expert assessment of

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.170
the manager or special professional

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.810
tests are most often used.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.170
And of course, it is very

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:13.990
convenient to use professional

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.930
tests, because they allow you to

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.270
simultaneously evaluate a very

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.110
large number of people by the

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.070
standard method and store this

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.230
data in digital form.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.110
For example, once a very large company

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.070
wants to evaluate a large

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.350
number of single-professional

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.130
specialists at the same time,

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:35.830
a professional test is usually

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.770
developed with the help of,,

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.230
external providers or internal

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.910
specialists.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.970
And with this test, a mass evaluation

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.150
of employees of these units is carried out.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.290
The second major assessment block is the

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.850
assessment of management skills.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.430
Here this block is important

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.030
for us precisely so that we

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.910
can assess what management potential

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.070
a given employee has and how much

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.210
in the near or distant future

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.330
we can consider this specialist

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.010
to a management position but here

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.070
there is such an afarism that if

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.230
we promote a super professional

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.130
to the level of a manager we get

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.870
a bad manager and lose a professional

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.450
of course this is not always

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.610
so so important so to evaluate

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.530
and relate the professional

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.850
skills of a person,

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.890
his management potential

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.330
and motivation.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.950
It is worth noting that if

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.590
the employee does not yet

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.450
occupy a management position,

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.270
then we are unlikely to have

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.830
experience of evaluating it

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.230
in terms of its management

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.430
skills.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.670
Here, in this case, you can give

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.290
the employee a temporary project,

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.690
a temporary working group, so that

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.910
he can try himself in this capacity,

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.930
as a manager, and so

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.170
that colleagues and his

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.510
managers can evaluate his

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.650
management skills.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.810
And to assess the managerial

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.750
potential of a person, case methods,

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.030
assessment centers or 360

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:05.470
interviews are usually used.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.070
And a very important point is also

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.130
the evaluation of employee

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.330
motivation for his career.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.130
Each of us, of course,

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.230
has faced strong professionals

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.390
who don’t want to hear anything

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.590
about a possible career, either

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.550
horizontal or vertical.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.370
They have already reached a comfortable

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.030
professional level, occupy

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:31.130
a certain position and perform

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.330
a certain range of functions

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.230
and bear a certain responsibility.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.430
They are not ready to even discuss

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.910
the possibilities of expanding their

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.970
functionality or the possibilities

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.010
of growth, as if it was not profitable

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.350
for companies.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.630
This is of course a special case.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.030
And, as you and I know,

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.370
certain corporate cultures,

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.190
a number of companies, they

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.250
despise the principle of “either

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.030
up or off board” and simply physically

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.130
dismiss employees who do not

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.210
advance in careers.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.350
Well, or create such conditions

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.310
when such employees are forced

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.730
to be fired, because sitting

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.210
in one place, sitting in one place,

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.630
in these companies is not popular.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.370
But most companies tolerate

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.430
such stars, which occupy a comfortable

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.850
professional position

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.270
for them.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.870
They are unique specialists

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.550
and meet the needs

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.770
of the company.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.550
Such employees, for example, can

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.950
be programmers at any age,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.570
at maturity, when the company has

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.350
repeatedly addressed them on the

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.630
topic of project leadership,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.190
management of departments,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.390
but they refuse to do so and

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.330
occupy a comfortable position

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.690
for themselves.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.070
Companies here have to tolerate

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.670
this if the interests of the

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.170
company, the interests of

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.730
employees coincide.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.430
But in other cases, there is a special

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.990
job here.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:58.130
Thus, in terms of evaluation, it

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.010
is very important to evaluate exactly

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.370
three blocks, as professional,

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.870
managerial and motivational.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.450
Motivation that can very seriously

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.930
affect our understanding of career

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.250
planning for this employee and here

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.850
on the next slide he is so small

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.010
but nevertheless here I

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.510
tried to reflect the main basic

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.450
issues that we can discuss

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.770
with the person on a career planning

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.690
interview in one of the companies

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.810
I managed to implement a holistic

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.250
project specifically on

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.930
career planning which was

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.350
initially not related to

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.050
the organizational structure

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.710
or the block of training

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.890
and development.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.650
And so we initiated structured

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.050
career planning interviews

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.890
with each employee in

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.090
the company.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.190
I can share with you this emotional

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.790
experience.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.910
It turned out to be very significant

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.810
for most employees.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.170
And they just said thank you for

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.010
talking to them about their ambitions,

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.730
their professional motivation,

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.510
about who they would like

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.530
to be in a year, two years.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.130
But I also had to touch

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.310
questions about the past of

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.310
employees, how they grew up in their

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.170
careers, what they think is

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.670
most important to themselves,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.830
what they are proud of.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.110
And it was such a full range

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.410
of information that he allowed me

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.910
to give recommendations to the company

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.750
on what direction we could

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.130
develop this employee.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.770
Well, in this slide with

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.950
the blue I highlighted the main

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.890
questions that I think are most

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.330
informative and may not be quite

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:44.470
banal for such communication.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.350
A career planning interview in

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.970
a number of companies

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.530
can be conducted with all employees

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.210
of certain divisions, or

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.450
all divisions.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.710
It may be linked to the performance

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.210
assessment procedure.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.610
And in some companies, career planning

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.010
interviews are conducted only with

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.790
employees who are included in

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:10.010
the pool or hi-po resource.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.970
These are highly potential

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:16.070
employees, on which the company

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.570
is betting in the long run and

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.050
is considered the right and can be

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.710
the most cost-effective, if the company

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.890
can not afford to plan a career

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.810
for all employees, it is considered

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.750
rational to plan it at least

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.410
for stars who have already manifested

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.290
themselves in the results of

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.870
their work, in the projects

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.810
they are involved in or which

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.130
they are leading.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.030
And then such interviews are

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.990
conducted with such employees.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.250
But in our experience with you,

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.410
of course, there were cases when

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.070
such an interview it was provoked

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.190
by the desire of a person to resign

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.110
when a person came to the manager

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.230
already practically a statement

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.910
and then the manager sent

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.750
this person to the HR department

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.870
and asked us to offer some option

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.910
to motivate an employee of a

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.830
valuable employee to stay in

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.810
the company and then of course

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.790
all we are talking about

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.130
in terms of career

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.870
planning here all applicable

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.390
and the process begins with

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.790
a career planning interview.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.230
When we identify the interests

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.490
of an employee, we talk to him

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.290
as if for life, for what

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.390
he likes in our company, what

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.210
possible prospects.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.810
And here it is very important to expand

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.110
the sphere of discussion with the employee

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:43.130
as much as possible so that he is not

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.930
stiffened by hierarchy, not stiffened

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.310
by the organizational structure.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:50.070
In order to be able to openly discuss

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.750
with him in what directions

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.050
he sees himself, in what positions

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.470
and in what directions he

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.030
would be interested in continuing

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.990
his career.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.830
And as a result of such

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.250
career planning, it can be very

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.110
non-trivial organizational

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.310
decisions, when a person from

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.690
one functional direction moves

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.050
to adjacent or completely

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.690
into another direction.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.290
But we will talk about this further.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.930
And also the moment we would

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.170
like to stop at, here the

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.190
next slide shows us the

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.210
implementation stages.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.660
Implementation stages are the completed

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.560
stages in the course of practical

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.420
implementation of career

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.520
planning projects.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.540
And they... here there are especially

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.500
important points – this is the

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.100
first and second paragraphs that

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.680
say that for us to identify

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.760
internal experts who will

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.860
give us formal and informal information

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.860
first, and also internal

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.620
public.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.380
As you understand, once we in the

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.460
company declare that we will

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.560
plan a career as an employee,

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.820
we launch such a project,

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.320
then employees have a moment

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.520
of uncertainty.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.400
Some of them may think that everything,

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.460
the company will encourage career

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.840
growth and so if he doesn’t want

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.100
to move anywhere, he will be fired.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.480
Some employees, on the contrary,

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.920
think that they will finally be able

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.580
to trade the most attractive conditions

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.820
for themselves from the company.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.380
Third-class employees

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.140
may not know anything about

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.960
it, but are in a state

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.320
of uncertainty.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.960
But, as you and I understand,

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.260
uncertainty is not the best condition

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.600
for work, so this is the second

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.120
point of the internal PR

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.080
project, it is very important

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.220
to pay special attention.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.780
Internal publicity here is important

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.140
to agree with the management and

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.200
publish on internal resources,

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.440
on all possible information

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.000
resources the main values and

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.360
the main importance of this

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.820
project for the company and for employees.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.840
Usually, the most painless

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.680
thing for an organization is when

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.520
we, a career planning

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.720
project, position it

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.460
as a tool for motivating

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.300
employees, as a tool for

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.860
learning and development.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.120
This is the most universal

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.840
wording, I would say, and the

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.560
most understandable for employees.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.760
All employees, to one degree or another,

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.100
dream of being trained by the company,

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.340
of course, for their own time and during

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.380
the working hours.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.320
And the company here can explain

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.980
that in order for us to train

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.600
you to plan your training and

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.620
development training, we need

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.040
to understand your expectations,

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.580
your ambitions and plan

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:45.680
each career.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.520
This is a universal formulation that

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.680
shows that in this project the interests

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.180
and the company, interests

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.960
and employees are united.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.520
And already the third point we

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.020
start planning the project

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.480
no earlier, because any action

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.920
from the HR management, as we know,

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.700
it immediately strains

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.720
employees if they don’t understand

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.980
what it is about.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.500
And since career planning, it affects

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.560
either certain units or the company

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.820
as a whole, it is important to

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.620
give people the necessary information,

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:22.880
as a simpler and more understandable

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.920
form.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.960
The next point is the creation of a

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960
map of career paths, then the methodology

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.920
of evaluation of personnel with

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.780
clear indicators, what we talked about

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.000
a little earlier, the conduct

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.960
of evaluation of personnel,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.840
discussion of results.

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.460
And here is a very important point

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.060
that of course career planning, we

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.840
try to make it as objective

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.880
as possible procedure and evaluation

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.980
methodology, as management

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.640
requires us to make as objective

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.280
and formalized, but really

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.740
in each company there is a policy

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.260
and, as a rule, the results of

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.780
the evaluation become the subject

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.240
of discussion of the senior

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.960
management about the employees

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.380
that are most interesting

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.400
or most important to the

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.220
company.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.840
Therefore, before taking any

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.160
action, the results of the

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.020
evaluation of employees are

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.320
usually discussed by the senior

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.340
management.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.100
And only after that we move to the stage

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.300
of feedback to the employee on the results

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.300
of the assessment, with career

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.940
planning, what we discussed a little

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.200
earlier, the method of conducting

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.280
the interview, and the normalization

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.240
of the pay matrix.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.380
It is very important to relate

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.600
wages to grades and grades that

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.100
are universal throughout

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.740
the company, but the wage

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.680
matrix can depend on regions

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.120
and countries where these

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.240
or those units are located.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.020
But here is a very important point

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.480
is exactly what each employee will feel,

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.760
will be able to compare themselves

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.920
with other employees on the basis of

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.540
the grade, not on the basis

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.320
of the salary, which depends

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.040
on regions and countries.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.400
And now we will discuss the mistakes

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.280
that are usually in companies just

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.520
in the plane of career management.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.400
But the first mistake, it is

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.180
so obvious, is the lack of a career

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.460
management function.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.740
And here on this slide we can see

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.760
what problems the naturality of

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.400
the process brings.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.440
The natural nature of the process leads

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.820
to the fact that we underestimate the ambitions

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.500
of the potential of the candidates

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.420
we are recruiting.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.140
As a result, candidates either

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.960
fail to survive, increases fluidity

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.700
during the trial period, staff

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.280
fluidity during the first year

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.360
of work, employees are

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.640
dissatisfied with their

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.740
position in the company, and

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.740
their performance decreases.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.180
The next point is extravagant

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.940
personnel solutions, When, as you

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.520
know, management sometimes likes

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.140
to somehow unexpectedly change

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.180
the positioning of a certain

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.700
employee, including top managers,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.200
to transfer to a related

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.080
function, without even discussing

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.940
the employees themselves

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.900
of this decision.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.260
Well, some managers,

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.860
reasonably or not reasonably,

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.200
believe that any promotion

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.940
they accompany with

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.640
a pay increase, it

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.600
should be desired by

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.600
the employee.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.560
There is such a mechanistic approach.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.780
Especially it is inherent in the

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.280
owners of the company, who believe that

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.240
for money any personnel decision

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:41.920
is possible.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.500
We understand that in

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.300
real business, of course, it

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.180
is not always.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.920
And in order to prevent the mistakes

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.820
of our management, it is very

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.280
important to plan your career

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.080
in a timely and accurate

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.100
manner.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:02.520
Third, if we talk about

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.760
learning, some companies teach

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.920
everyone everything or

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.100
something, and as a result if

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.400
learning processes and training

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.140
plans are not related to career

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.100
planning and the company’

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.620
s strategic goals, then it’

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.780
s mostly wasted money.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.160
This is not an optimal investment

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.520
in education and development.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.720
Furthermore, it is also a consequence of

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.440
the error of the absence of

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.720
function is an uncontrollable struggle

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.840
of ambitions of employees, which they try

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.080
in an honest, in their opinion,

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.180
management struggle to prove to the

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.440
management, who of them is cooler, who

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.600
of them is more worthy of promotion

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.800
and increase in salary.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.000
As you understand, this

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.660
does not add workability under division,

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.700
but accordingly it negatively affects

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.600
the atmosphere in the team, and

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.640
in order for us to retain employees,

00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.940
we have to do this with

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.760
salary, accordingly, the company

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.040
increases the company's costs

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.620
on salaries, which is also

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.040
not optimal.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.720
In the next slide, we see the

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.240
next problem, which is also related

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.740
to career planning, is the

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.700
lack of systemicity.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.260
For example, if, especially in large

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.220
companies, this happens, career planning

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.260
lives in one department, training

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.580
in another department, adaptation

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.920
assessment in the following departments

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.360
and, accordingly, these

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.260
processes have internal logic,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.280
but are not related.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.840
As a result, the system of

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.880
management of personnel loses its effectiveness.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.580
And here graphically I

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.480
tried to show how through career

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.300
planning, which affects the way

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:55.140
in which all the functions of

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.580
human resources management

00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:58.680
can be systematized

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.840
and act precisely in

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.760
the system.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.300
The next mistake that also affects

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.260
and lies in the field

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.060
of career planning is poor ambition

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.360
management.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.660
There may be two

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.100
opposite situations.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.920
On the one hand, when an ambitious

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.120
employee, whom the company has

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.220
not noticed time, he in one way

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.240
or another receives offers from

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.600
another company, it is usually

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.860
competitors in the same

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.520
industry and leaves us.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.460
That is, he will now carry his work

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.260
in favor of our competitors, which

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.540
is therefore absolutely unprofitable

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.800
for us and you.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.860
Either the employee, on the contrary,

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.440
has low ambitions, and by the logic

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.120
of the company’s development we begin

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.540
to promote him, because we initially

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.200
seem, thanks to the stereotype,

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.280
that every employee is interested

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.940
in promotion and in the increase

00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:59.200
of salary.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.980
In practice, this is far from so.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.480
Some employees are willing to take

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.080
their position, they have reached

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.940
the balance of life and work they

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.340
sought, and therefore they

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:13.120
do not dream of any promotion

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.820
and, in addition, will

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.340
create an obstacle, depending

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.000
on whether they can, honestly,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.460
or not.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.600
How is this problem solved?

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.100
It is a detailed career ladder with

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.960
a clear system of requirements for

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.060
all competences, both

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.880
professional and managerial, and

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.740
with a clear link to the salary

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.540
levels.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.080
Here is a pyramid that

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:43.340
shows about 11 levels

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.780
of career possible in

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.920
the company.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.440
An example is a consulting

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.320
company.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.660
In consulting, almost all employees

00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.700
are homogeneous, doing

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.260
the same thing.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.720
But in order to preserve the

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.040
competence of the employee

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.060
within the company and in order

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.460
not to overpay the newcomers

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.920
and retain more experienced

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.620
employees, a very detailed

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:15.100
career matrix is built.

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.600
Well here here here as an example

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.540
I have given, and we see here

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.560
that indeed in a company

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.460
this matrix of 11 levels or 20 levels

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.800
can be written for the entire professional

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.580
life of an employee and ideally

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.720
to hold him for life in one

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.660
company, which is often the

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.080
case in large Western

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.160
companies global as we

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:36.740
know.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.340
There are also two situations possible.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.800
A number of employees, they are

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.040
not ready to wait until in two years,

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.740
in three years, they will be considered

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.320
to the next career stage, and they

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.060
simply move to other companies,

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.520
occupy higher positions

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.700
immediately.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.020
But for another number of employees,

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.360
on the contrary, they are close to

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.260
such a career planning option as living

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.980
in one company, and working in one

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.540
company, in one industry all their

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.140
lives, and then for them such

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.800
a high career ladder, it is just

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.360
adequate for their motivation

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.280
and for their promotion,

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.760
for their life within the

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.580
company.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.380
We have already noted a moment that is

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.740
associated with the fact that not always the

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.840
ambitions of the employee and the company's

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.640
opportunities for his promotion coincide.

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.220
And most often, of course,

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.280
special analytical work is

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.840
needed to understand how within

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.420
this organizational structure

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.420
our employees have career

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.100
opportunities.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.880
And on this slide I tried to reflect

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.760
how we can solve this problem as

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.560
a disagreement between the

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.960
needs of the business and

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.760
ambitions of employees.

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.700
For example, we take all related

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.380
units with the one in which

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.720
the employee we consider is located.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.260
This is the case with the

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.620
marketing division.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.000
Let us suppose that our employee

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.220
who is dissatisfied with his position

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.340
is at the level of a specialist, and we

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.440
with you, based on the results

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.780
of the evaluation of his

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.940
performance, assessed that yes, indeed,

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.060
his knowledge and experience, they

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.460
exceed the requirements of the position.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.200
But directly in the marketing division

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.780
we do not see such opportunities

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.760
for promotion, as all positions, as

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.240
we see, are occupied, the head of

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.620
the group and the head of

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.820
the department.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.260
Then we begin to analyze all

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.480
related professional areas.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.760
In relation to marketing, it

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.840
is CRM, customer work, it

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.780
is sales, it can also be projects.

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.980
In these verticals we can

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.660
see possible vacancies.

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.320
Thus, for this specialist,

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.100
we can show that he has the possibility

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.580
of horizontal rotation

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.900
in other related units, in

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.980
which he will gain new experience

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.180
and new knowledge that will

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.100
help him make a significant

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.280
advance in his career, depending,

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.240
of course, on how much

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.740
we evaluate his management

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.620
potential and management

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.240
skills, how really

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.660
he wants to move precisely

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.340
along the management

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.540
vertical.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.360
For a certain amount of time for

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.020
an employee such rotations,

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.380
horizontal to adjacent

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.200
units, can look very profitable.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.830


01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.570
It is in that sense that the employee

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:37.830
himself expands the scope of his

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:39.890
professional competences and he is

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.250
well aware that at the highest level,

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.710
at which these functions are combined,

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.270
for example, as a sales director

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.750
or a director of publicity and

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.590
advertising, all of this knowledge

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.070
he gains at this first stage,

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.130
going through rotations in

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.530
related units, this knowledge

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.510
will be very important

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:00.870
to him.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:02.850
And if the employee really looks

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:06.890
to the distant future, he will

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.250
be optimistic about our arguments

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.190
and the opportunity

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.210
to rotate into adjacent units.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.350
In this example, I gave a

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.970
very small slide in English,

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.430
but it really doesn’t matter.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.210
The most important thing in this slide is logic.

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:26.270
The logic of career planning

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:30.870
options is when on the first line

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:33.730
we show the requirements for

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.410
increasing grades, general requirements.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:39.270
Here TA means the triple-

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:43.090
analyst, next level A, the first is

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.670
the analysis of the first level,

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:47.110
the analysis of the second, third,

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:49.330
and then the leading analysts of the

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:50.590
first, second, third, fourth grade,

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:53.970
this is an example of career planning

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.150
for programmers and in the first

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.330
line are the basic requirements

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.950
for the data grades which are

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.710
common to anyone or another career

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.990
development logic the second line

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:09.630
it shows us the professional logic

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:12.270
of career development and

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.230
the third line shows the management

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.490
logic as we see here we give programmers

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:18.010
the opportunity to grow

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.690
by and by the level of salary

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:22.730
in the professional plane,

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:24.350
as well as start their managerial

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.530
growth with the level

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:29.850
of grid analyst 3.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:31.790
Man can already take on more

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.510
and more managerial functions,

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:35.350
and we show him this in

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:36.570
a special third line.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.530
I can say that by experience,

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:40.750
when we discuss

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.130
a career planning interview

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:47.930
with an employee, this

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.610
is a very positive

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:53.490
impression on employees

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:54.790
because they finally

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.370
showed their opportunities

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.090
in a given company

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:00.270
and clear requirements

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:02.750
depending on

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.970
the grid.

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.630
Well, as you know, there are such

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.750
curious situations when we hire a

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.030
less experienced employee to work.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.050
For the first three months, six months, we are

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.730
energetically teaching him, and it seems

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.470
to the person that he already knows everything

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:19.130
in his field.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:23.390
And here very such a cooling

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:26.370
factor is that we show this

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:29.070
employee who believes he knows

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.590
everything, he is worthy of transfer

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:32.970
to a higher grade, we

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:35.030
show him this matrix of

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.870
career paths and requirements

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.610
to each grade.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.250
And when we tell the person that

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.350
yes, you have learned these three

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:45.730
technologies that are necessary for

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.390
this grid, but in the requirements

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.810
of this grid 15 technologies.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.370
Therefore, the company will

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.790
give you the opportunity to rotate

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.950
in projects, or in divisions,

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.650
during which you will get, you will

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:01.890
have the opportunity to develop

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.550
all your 10 other skills, 10

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.150
other technologies, and thus, through

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:09.330
some amount of assessments we

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.970
can consider you to advance to

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:12.530
the next grid.

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:14.250
Therefore, it is the

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.030
information of employees that plays

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.330
a key role here.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.390
Because if an employee does not

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:21.790
have information, he may have

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.530
inadequate ambitions.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.010
And when we give information

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:27.110
to a person, show them the general

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.270
rules of the game, show them that, yes,

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.610
these general rules are adopted

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:33.490
by the top management of the company,

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:34.830
and they work for every

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.230
employee, not just for him.

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:40.090
And all the logic of the development

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.930
of colleagues, it is subject to these

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.370
rules, It brings absolute clarity

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:46.550
in this, let’s say so, in

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.130
this corporate game, in this

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:49.210
corporate life.

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.010
And employees feel more confident,

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.810
on the one hand, and on

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.230
the other, feel more

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:56.210
protected.

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:57.890
The employee understands that only

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:01.510
his career advancement depends on

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.150
his efforts and his energy

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.410
and initiative.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:07.270
And with the help of such a card it

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.130
is very effective to motivate

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:11.850
employees for those projects

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:15.550
that they would not agree

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.390
with other information.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:21.830
For example, we have introduced such

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.050
an important point in this

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.630
matrix as the need for each employee

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:28.330
to a certain degree of

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.010
necessity, the programmer must

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.430
work in support of customers.

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.830
And here we put it as a prerequisite

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.630
and justify programmers

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.790
that only after working in

01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:42.490
this function, customer support

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.470
functions, they will acquire

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.430
very important skills.

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:49.350
First, they will better

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.570
understand the needs

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:53.590
of customers, they will

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.490
better understand what

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:56.970
mistakes customers

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:59.470
are most often dealing

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:01.790
with, they will better

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:03.690
understand the code that

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:07.010
they did not write, they

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:08.990
will better learn

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:11.410
how to work optimally

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.970
with this code

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.170
and find the mistakes

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:18.710
in it and correct them

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.090
and it will play a key

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:23.350
role in the next assessment

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.050
so that in such a

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.710
detailed career pathway

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.970
map it is also a fundamental

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:35.190
moment when each employee

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:37.330
can see the horizon

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:38.970
of their development

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.370
on one page of the

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:41.810
logic of the employees

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.110
themselves, the development

01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.670
of their ambition

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.330
and the logic of the

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.610
business needs here

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.330
we are the business

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:57.030
needs play a key

01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:58.950
role in this career

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.230
pathway matrix and

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:01.910
when it is suited

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:03.630
to one page it is

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:05.690
also a fundamental

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.050
moment when each

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.690
employee can see

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:11.990
the horizon of

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:15.930
their development

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:18.210
directly on one

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:20.290
page it is very

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.830
important for him

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:26.650
to see such an

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.070
obvious normal

01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:31.030
logic and this

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:35.530
document becomes

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:38.950
well open and

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.210
Thus, in order to link career

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:44.090
planning with management

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.850
decision-making, a single information

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:47.630
system works very well

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.150
for this purpose.

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.310
When all our employees and organizational

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.230
structure live in the same software

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.850
system and management, when

01:07:56.850 --> 01:07:58.770
it has a need to consider

01:07:58.770 --> 01:07:59.970
or compare several employees,

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:01.470
identify the best candidate

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.670
for promotion, management

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:05.550
can literally do this with

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.190
a few clicks of the mouse,

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.350
get a comparative report on

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:12.290
several employees and can

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:14.370
make one or another management

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.450
decision and in

01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:18.350
addition this decision it

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:19.690
will be argued because

01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:21.890
it will be based on objective

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:24.750
factors respectively this

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.150
is the engine of the

01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:28.510
career planning process.

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.490
In the next slide, I wanted

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:35.130
to reflect that different details

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:36.950
can play a very big role in career

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.690
planning, for example, during

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.170
one assessment center when

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:42.810
we identified the management

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:44.810
competencies, different

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.150
assessment tools were used,

01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:50.250
including tests, and competition

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.950
interviews.

01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.390
We sought to identify

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.930
the stars we could recommend

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:01.230
for management promotion

01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:03.230
on the basis of objective factors.

01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:05.250
The only point that in this company

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:06.750
it was global, the promotion

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:10.930
it was related, including

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:12.730
the need to change

01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:14.130
the place of residence,

01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:16.430
to move to another region.

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:19.110
Yes, a man won in the salary, and the

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:21.090
company thought that.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.410
The company was considered,

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.910
and most employees also thought

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:27.910
that it was such a very great

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:28.970
happiness if you were distinguished

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.350
as stars, and you have such wonderful

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:34.210
opportunities opened

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.010
before you as moving to other

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.390
regions with increases

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.250
in salary and positions.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.810
During my interview, what was

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.770
my surprise when I saw a really

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:46.170
very strong candidate who

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:48.370
showed very strong results in various

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.330
tests and objectively belonged

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.430
to the category of stars

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:56.470
of this company, when I saw

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.150
on his face very such, you can

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.490
say, even a complaining

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.630
expression.

01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:03.550
And our interview ended with the fact

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.730
that he asked not to include in

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.050
the reservists, in the category of

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:09.270
stars, because he just doesn’t want

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.070
to change his place of residence,

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:12.430
here he has relatives, here he has

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.910
a large family, here his children

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:15.370
study.

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:19.050
And he looked with such sadness

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:21.030
and said that yes, despite the

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.550
fact that we spent so much time

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.490
on him, and indeed he is very strong

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:26.150
in results and in his management

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:28.670
potential and in the capabilities,

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.430
the ability to learn.

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.010
However, there was just a banal,

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.710
one might say, banal household

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.390
barrier that he simply did not

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:40.210
want to change his place

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:40.910
of work.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.030
And so he was not ready to move forward

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.390
within the framework, within

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:47.270
the global framework.

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:50.290
But within this region, there were

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:51.830
no opportunities for promotion,

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.750
but it did not create any discomfort

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.890
for him.

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.810
Thus, during this deep assessment,

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:01.550
the company finally received

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.330
information that a person simply

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:04.690
does not want to advance for

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:06.870
domestic reasons, for reasons

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.670
of a family nature, but otherwise

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:11.130
it did not know about it.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.350
Also here in the next slide I

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:19.110
talk about ignoring the context.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:23.170
The fact is that when we form a pool

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:27.650
of reservists, we distinguish the stars

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.150
through numerous assessment procedures,

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:33.370
and we attract a huge attention to

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.770
the employees, we develop them,

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:37.530
create individual development

01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:39.430
plans for them.

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.470
This objectively causes some

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:44.270
alarm in the manager.

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:46.970
The manager understands, either

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.190
for objective or subjective

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:50.290
reasons, that he is unable or

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:55.450
unwilling to move into

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:58.870
the emerging natural anxiety

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:01.210
about his highly potential employees.

01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:03.170
There are even cases when the

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:04.430
management and management

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:06.550
of the company do not have sufficient

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:09.170
control over what is happening in the unit.

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.190
Such highly potential employees,

01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.350
they easily get offers from

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.290
competitors, and for

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:19.010
them, the management directly

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:20.510
the manager creates a situation

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:22.890
when a person simply

01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:24.370
accepts another offer,

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:26.090
goes to the company.

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:27.870
Accordingly, this company has

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:29.790
lost money, invested time in

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:31.410
this employee, and it is already

01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.970
losing it.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.590
How to overcome this obstacle?

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:39.530
Since the company is large,

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:41.830
it has many units, many companies.

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.490
If there are not enough companies,

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:44.930
but you can talk about the fact that

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:46.790
the company is growing, and

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.030
therefore vacancies arise in

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.730
different departments and if

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.310
the company postulates that

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:54.790
the employee is preparing and the

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.510
company prepares him for employment

01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.390
is not the place of his immediate

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.670
manager but that a person can be prepared

01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:03.670
for higher positions in another

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.410
division or in another enterprise

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.670
in another region this usually

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.570
eases the situation and removes

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.670
the conflict of interest

01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:15.190
of the immediate and his highly

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.950
potential employee.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.890
This is, of course, also a moment

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.750
that can be solved precisely with

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.870
the help of internal pillar and with

01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:26.030
the help of the right management decisions.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.590
When there is a real human resource

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:30.050
movement from one division

01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:31.810
to another, between enterprises,

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:34.490
only then will the immediate

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:36.010
bosses not feel threatened

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:38.310
by their highly potential

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.970
subordinates.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:44.810
In the next slide, I describe

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:46.230
another obstacle to career planning

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:48.050
as a local interest.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.530
The fact is that the direct leader

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:53.350
is least interested in

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.030
the careers of his subordinates.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:57.010
Why is?

01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:59.950
Because he just banally doesn’t

01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:01.810
want to lose a strong employee.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:04.230
And, of course, here we immediately

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.250
get this obstacle that the managers

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.810
themselves are not always ready

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.910
to give the management of

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:14.290
their stars staff and point to

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:14.670
them.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:16.930
They, on the contrary, want to hide

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.530
this and want to keep their employees

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:20.390
in their unit as long as possible.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:21.890
But this is very unprofitable

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.670
for the company, because a company

01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:25.110
with a high probability of an ambitious

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:26.370
employee can lose.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.210
And if the employee is not ambitious

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.410
enough, then the company may lose the

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:32.550
opportunities for the development

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:34.030
of this employee, the expansion of its

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.070
functionality, its responsibilities.

01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:38.710
This problem is solved by the fact

01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:40.930
that the project on human resources

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.390
management, on the management of the

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:47.110
career of personnel, it has a single

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:49.050
center, becomes systemic and

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.970
is managed independently, as

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:52.530
a rule, by the management of human

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:55.390
resources, HRs, or by an external provider.

01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:59.150
This business process is managed

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:00.830
independently, all data

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.430
is processed centrally and it

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:05.170
is very important that this process

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:06.850
is such a total and inevitable

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.490
that each manager understands

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:09.930
that this is not only about

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:11.530
his unit, this process

01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:13.090
is about the company

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.550
as a whole.

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:18.310
Then the obstacles from the direct

01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.890
managers, they will not be able

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.230
to realize, despite the fact

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:24.570
that they, of course, can be,

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:26.530
but, nevertheless, and will

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.830
be harder to implement.

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.310
The next possible problem in career

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:32.670
planning is a narrow understanding

01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:34.490
of the process itself.

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:37.350
If the company understands this

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:41.290
only as a vertical promotion, there

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:43.550
are two possible problems, as

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:45.210
we have already said, the promotion

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.610
of a highly professional

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:48.390
specialist without management

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:51.790
competencies, or the obstruction

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.730
of the boss to work with

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:57.090
that employee, just because

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:58.350
he feels he has management

01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:59.610
ambitions.

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:01.590
Accordingly, the solution to this

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.070
problem is postulating in the company

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:06.030
and advertising the internal pear

01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:09.490
in the company horizontal cross-

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:13.170
departmental career and vertical

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.330
career, but in related units.

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:24.450
This but this is the next slide

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:25.750
shows us the problem that concerns

01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.330
a number of international

01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:28.670
ambitious companies, which

01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:33.030
with the help of different methods

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:35.250
of corporate culture they specifically

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:38.450
provoke the competition of employees,

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:40.230
specifically provoke

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:43.110
their ambitions and create fashion

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:45.410
for career promotion and

01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:47.050
anti-mode to long occupy

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:48.890
the same position.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.270
If it is based on business logic,

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:55.230
then you can do nothing about it.

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:57.770
But if the business logic is

01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:59.530
not in conflict with both a fast career

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:02.170
and a long job in one position,

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:06.950
it is important to understand very well

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:08.230
about career development,

01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:10.310
as well as professional development

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:12.230
simply within the same position,

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:16.230
but through deepening functionality

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:20.170
and expanding powers, with

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:25.650
adequate financial incentives.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.730
Also, on the next slide I talk

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:32.590
about another problem of work on

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.350
career planning, it is insufficient

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.270
employee responsibility.

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.350
And here in the column we see that

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:41.410
the employee’s responsibility lies in

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:43.610
the motivation plane, in the actualization

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:45.450
plane of his potential and

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.970
professional and managerial.

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:49.190
The employee’s real professional

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:52.750
personal efforts to overcome

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.910
obstacles in his professional

01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:57.210
development and in the development

01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:00.090
of management.

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:02.710
And here, as a rule, even the efforts

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:05.710
of HR or external coaching, coaching,

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:08.750
as an in-depth consultation of

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.910
the employee on the disclosure

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.330
of his personal potential,

01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:15.370
which is necessary for professional

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:17.530
that is, this support of

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:19.050
employees in his professional

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:20.410
growth.

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:21.750
Since we now see that most often

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:24.030
now career growth, it is even

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:26.010
management growth, it outperforms

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:28.570
personal growth, personal

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:30.850
development, and we see top managers

01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:33.810
at 23 years, and at 25 years,

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:36.470
and the social experience

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:38.950
of the employee here is

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:40.710
not enough to effectively

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:43.490
solve issues at such

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:44.630
a high level.

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:47.430
The company can provide

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:49.630
assistance in the form of

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.130
coaching.

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.250
From the company’s side,

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.550
the responsibility for the promotion

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:57.050
of the employee is quality management

01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:59.650
of personnel, adaptation of assessment,

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:01.310
development training, motivation

01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:04.450
and the adoption of balanced

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:06.010
personnel decisions.

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:07.510
On the one hand, these decisions

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.370
should be timely, they should be

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.810
prepared by the logic of the employee,

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:13.870
the logic of his development, the

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.410
logic of assessing

01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:18.010
his performance, and they should

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:21.330
simply be made in time before

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:23.330
the ambitions of the employee

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.170
go too far from the company's

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:26.270
possibilities.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:33.810
So, now we go to the question of discussing

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:36.430
the specifics of the work of

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:39.670
the training center in the plane

01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:40.890
of career planning.

01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:43.610
What activities on training and

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:45.310
development of employees support

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:48.610
the process of career planning.

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:50.430
So, on this slide, I want

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.970
to show you how the company’

01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:53.870
s perception of training

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:56.010
usually evolves.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:00.310
So, in the first stage, the first stage

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:01.650
of understanding the company’

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:03.730
s need for learning, it is usually teaching

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:06.970
someone something on the initiative

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:12.190
of themselves there are no serious

01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:13.450
grounds for training, or

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:15.730
they are formal, and learning

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:18.610
is built absolutely spontaneously.

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.390
But this leads either to

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:22.890
non-optimal cost of training

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:25.690
or to the fact that they are simply

01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.490
unnecessary costs.

01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:30.790
At the second stage of the training

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:34.030
system in the company, all managers

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.430
are usually asked what

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:39.530
they need to train their employees.

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:42.630
And this information is collected

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.570
in the staff department and it is believed

01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:45.970
that this is already, so to

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:47.090
speak, such a systemic approach

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:48.010
to learning.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.890
But from this pyramid, we see that this

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:50.930
is far from the case.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:52.770
And even if a company, for example,

01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:55.890
wants to train and improve

01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.230
sales skills

01:20:57.230 --> 01:20:58.610
in its sales division,

01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:59.930
in the sales division,

01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:01.850
it somehow helps to

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:04.010
make training feasible

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:07.330
and investment training

01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:10.470
also effective.

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:12.950
As we can see in this pyramid at the

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.850
third level, here the company is already

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:17.810
organizing its own training center.

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:20.270
Internal trainers are hired for

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:22.010
internal training, external providers

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.950
are involved, tenders are held

01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:25.950
and the company thus tries to

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:28.170
make investments in training

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.550
as effective and

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:31.750
optimal as possible.

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:34.030
Themes are selected in which

01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:36.050
the best use of internal trainers is made.

01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:38.590
Usually this topic is related

01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:42.870
to sales and management for

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.130
very large companies.

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:46.010
And only at the fourth level

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:48.130
appears a corporate university.

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:50.030
A corporate university is

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.390
a systemic staff training

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:54.230
program that affects almost

01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:55.950
all employees.

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.470
Even if we are talking about

01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.390
packers, for example, packers

01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.990
can be trained on holiday packaging

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:05.730
or the most optimal packaging

01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:06.650
and so on.

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:09.330
Here, the training system covers

01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:11.230
all employees and it is

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.530
positioned according to the positions

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:15.850
and depending on the needs

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.170
of the company, the needs of

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:19.950
employees in each position.

01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:23.330
And at the fifth stage, the corporate

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:24.750
culture of self-learning

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:28.430
is already formed when different factors

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:30.450
work simultaneously.

01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:32.070
Formalized corporate training

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:34.150
center, workplace training, coaching

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.870
and the very value of a self-

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:38.730
learning organization that

01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:40.790
supports innovation, including

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.670
in human resource management.

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:44.730
So, as you can see, in training,

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:47.010
companies also have a place to

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.610
grow, and you can evaluate

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:50.190
on this pyramid what level your

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.050
company is at now and what

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.090
you need to do to move

01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:54.610
to the next level.

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.890
So, on the next slide we see the

01:22:56.890 --> 01:22:58.950
training center and its relationship

01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:02.450
with other HR functions.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.930
And we see here that really

01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:06.010
all functions, they are very interrelated,

01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.670
and the training center can actually

01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:10.230
serve not only the purpose of learning,

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:13.530
but it is also related to the evaluation

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.110
of personnel and career planning,

01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:16.850
and the adaptation of personnel,

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:19.590
and the activity of learning

01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:22.930
they also depend on the life

01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.110
cycle of the person in

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:26.130
the company.

01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:27.570
We know that in some positions

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.430
employees usually work for

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:31.670
six months, a year, and for the company

01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:33.910
it is appropriate, for the business

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:35.670
it is appropriate.

01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.090
And, accordingly, training

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:38.830
programs for these positions

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:40.470
are tailored to the particular

01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:41.790
employee life cycle.

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:43.610
In some positions, the company is

01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:46.790
interested in the longest possible

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:48.970
life of the employee, and then

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:50.690
the training programs and career

01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:52.490
planning are set up on this.

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:54.390
In the next two slides,

01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:56.470
I tried to reflect career

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.910
opportunities for employees

01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:01.170
who hold their positions

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.410
in production units and

01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:03.990
for office employees.

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:06.310
For example, career paths even

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:08.330
in production units, for example,

01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:09.370
where we work packers, equipment

01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:11.570
suppliers, logistics,

01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:15.770
warehouse specialists, controllers.

01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:18.530
There are also possible career paths.

01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:22.010
The only point is the requirements

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:23.970
for a particular position.

01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:26.510
And here in practice it turns

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:28.410
out that an employee who wants to

01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:31.350
move to a more highly paid branch

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:34.450
of career development, he needs

01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.450
to gain additional professional knowledge

01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:39.070
and skills and carry out this

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:42.210
translation even with a drop

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.550
in the position.

01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:45.550
For example, a person from a

01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:48.290
packaging position can only move

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:50.770
to a controller position after

01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:52.850
studying certain software products

01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:54.170
on the computer.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:55.830
And after he learns to use a

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:57.010
computer, accordingly, such

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.190
a transition is possible only

01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:00.170
with a decline in the position.

01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:01.950
But the employee goes on to this

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:05.030
if he has ambitions to grow precisely

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:07.530
on another career vertical and

01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:10.550
other opportunities in salary and

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:11.810
on the next slide we can see

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:14.050
similar development of career

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:15.390
paths but already for office

01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:16.970
staff here I took the related

01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:20.030
units for example this

01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:23.730
business with customers marketing

01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:26.710
sales usually at the end of each

01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:29.890
of these verticals a person can

01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:31.830
grow to the position of the general

01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:33.450
director and possible rotations

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:36.590
they are very easy at the bottom

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:39.190
levels, at the degrees of specialists,

01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:42.330
junior specialists, when

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:44.170
the employee masters some

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:45.970
very narrow area and

01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:48.050
must be a professional

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:49.350
in it.

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:51.510
Further, possible rotations are

01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:53.890
already at the middle management level,

01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:55.590
when a person leads a division,

01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:58.830
and here the knowledge of related

01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:00.930
units also plays a key role.

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:03.590
And if we show an employee who occupies

01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:06.510
the position of a specialist what

01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:09.090
his horizontal rotations can be

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:10.550
even with the maintenance of

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:13.370
the salary without a salary increase

01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:15.550
they will help him move

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.470
faster vertically after some

01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:18.710
time it can be very such a motivating

01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:20.770
and important moment for employees

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:22.930
the same possible parallel

01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:25.970
rotations for employees accounting

01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:28.050
and financial rotations

01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:35.710
by function.

01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:37.290
Well, for almost every direction

01:26:37.290 --> 01:26:39.870
you can find possible parallel

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.970
movements that will motivate employees,

01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:43.270
give them a sense of novelty,

01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.330
give them additional experience,

01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.210
additional skills and as

01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:49.450
a result, as employees often

01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:51.890
say, their capitalization

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:53.910
in the labour market will

01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:54.830
increase.

01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:57.090
They can sell themselves more expensive

01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:59.230
inside that company or inside another

01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:00.170
company.

01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:03.710
In this slide, I tried to reflect

01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:06.790
in detail how the tasks of the

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:09.270
training center are set and how

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:10.850
they are attached to the stages

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:13.710
of the career.

01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:18.510
Here, as we see, the career ladder

01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:21.130
unfolds in the plane of the

01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:23.310
learning task and in the plane

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:25.590
of the program themes.

01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:28.750
This slide is important only in terms

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:31.210
of the fact that the detail of

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:33.110
training plans is very serious

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:35.790
and it is precisely tied to career

01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.970
plans well and then we can look

01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:40.630
more in detail on this slide on the

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:43.470
example of an intern on the Internet

01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:47.250
sales of music discs we see what

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.430
themes of programs are important

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:51.810
for him if he only comes to the

01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.030
company and the content of

01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:55.590
these programs as we see at the

01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:59.190
level of an intern for us in the

01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.190
opposite adaptation of the employee,

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.130
which we through adaptation

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.330
training, and his professional

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:06.950
adaptation.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.250
At this stage it is very important to give

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.010
a person some minimum of skills and minimum

01:28:12.010 --> 01:28:13.950
of knowledge, but in order for a person

01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:16.130
to be able to effectively manifest

01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:19.770
themselves on a sufficiently narrow

01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:21.570
functionality, so that a person feels

01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:22.850
the result of his work as quickly

01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:24.850
as possible, that yes, he can, yes,

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:27.030
and he is recognized in this company.

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:29.130
And only after We gradually

01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:30.290
reveal to this

01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:32.630
employee how much he

01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:34.330
needs to learn to advance

01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:36.050
his career.

01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:38.630
For example, here we see for a

01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:40.110
junior specialist in selling

01:28:40.110 --> 01:28:42.930
music discs already a substantially

01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:45.230
larger range of programs

01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:47.170
that he has to study.

01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:50.130
We can see how many training he

01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:51.150
has to do.

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:53.610
And when we show an employee

01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:55.970
from the youngest position

01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.690
the vertical of development and

01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:01.110
all those topics he has to teach,

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.310
which he has to learn, on his

01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:04.790
way into the company, it

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:07.030
is also motivating for a person.

01:29:07.090 --> 01:29:08.610
He understands that yes, he

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:10.250
takes his career seriously,

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:12.010
he takes his training seriously,

01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:15.930
and he has a place to grow and

01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:17.350
he has a prospect.

01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:19.350
In this slide, we see how

01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:21.830
detailed this is revealed

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:23.810
to specialists in selling

01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:25.030
music discs.

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:30.460
Here we can see that at

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.120
the level of the senior specialist

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.560
we already want some skills

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.820
coaching of mentoring skills

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:43.360
in relation to the junior

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.780
professionals so we gradually

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:49.420
in the specialist cultivate

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.460
the skills of management

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.020
and let him try this function

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.360
so that he himself decided

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.820
how interesting it is to

01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.520
be a manager or not

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.300
interested as we understand

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.060
that in the vertical sales

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.260
for us as for the company

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.540
is as interesting as a person

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.980
who just sells well and

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.200
sells a lot and sells with

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.040
each period more and

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.000
more also to us more and

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.140
more interesting people

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.000
who grow vertically and

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:22.980
occupy management

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.760
positions respectively here

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:29.280
we support this and other

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.580
logic and at a higher

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.660
level here a person can

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:35.660
take the position of head

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:41.550
of sales department and

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:43.350
music discs and what

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:45.490
problems we can encounter

01:30:45.490 --> 01:30:47.390
on the path of planning

01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:48.670
a career in the company

01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:50.590
managers but are

01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:52.170
afraid of losing

01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:54.150
the values of

01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:56.770
specialists in their

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.450
pre-subsection

01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:00.510
or other ways

01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:03.470
Managers themselves react very painfully

01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:05.950
to the combination of the budget for

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:08.730
training and its management by

01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:10.750
the already HRC, by the management

01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:12.090
of personnel.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.750
If managers are used to the fact that

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.230
each of them decides on

01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:17.770
his or her own what to teach, then

01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:20.490
with the centralization of this budget,

01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:22.710
plans are developed centrally,

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.930
and here they already, of course,

01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:26.710
lose this freedom, this opportunity

01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:28.650
to teach each employee

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.310
at their discretion.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:34.800
If within the HR division functions

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.760
are very differentiated and training

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.380
professionals do not coordinate

01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.980
their actions with career

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.700
development professionals, it is

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.600
clear that the company is also

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.580
losing efficiency.

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:48.160
And also, if the company does

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.660
not have a normal software system

01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.600
that would allow to get management

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.520
information on time and use

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.960
it for management decisions,

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.420
then here the company

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.460
also loses.

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.840
In this slide, I have reflected

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.880
at least 4 global obstacles on

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:08.720
this path.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.600
And in conclusion here this slide

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.040
he shows, I would like to illustrate

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.200
him that career planning

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.260
and learning process development,

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.740
they should go side by side

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.240
and should support each other.

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.560
This is when the company receives

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:29.200
the most return on investment in

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:29.840
this process.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.780
Thanks for attention.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.080
I hope the complexity of this topic

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.960
did not scare you.

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.240
You’ve seen how many each company

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.880
can go through stages in both

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.760
career planning and development learning.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.540
You have seen how much detail

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.340
you can plan both a career

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:48.420
and a study.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:49.960
That is, now you and I understand

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:51.900
what we can aim for and how

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.720
we can optimally use our investments

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.200
for business development, and

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.760
how we can synergies between

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.100
business interests and employees’

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.540
ambitions.

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.320
I wish you success on this difficult

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.100
path!
