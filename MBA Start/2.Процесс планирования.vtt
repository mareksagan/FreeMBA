00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
So, friends, we have finished the first chapter,

00:02.820 --> 00:05.820
we have defined the main parameters of planning,

00:05.820 --> 00:10.020
and now we are moving directly to the planning process.

00:10.020 --> 00:16.420
First of all, we are engaged in forecasting the money flows.

00:16.420 --> 00:19.720
In general, planning of finances,

00:19.720 --> 00:22.620
strategic, operational, tactical,

00:22.620 --> 00:25.220
is the final stage of planning

00:25.220 --> 00:30.220
of the entire business activity.

00:30.220 --> 00:33.220
In order to make a financial plan,

00:33.220 --> 00:36.220
we need the data of the marketing plan,

00:36.220 --> 00:40.220
production plan, organizational plans,

00:40.220 --> 00:43.220
and all other types of business plans.

00:43.220 --> 00:46.220
But to follow the composition of these plans,

00:46.220 --> 00:48.220
usually in parallel,

00:48.220 --> 00:51.220
since it is necessary to ensure feedback,

00:51.220 --> 00:55.220
to take into account the production realities,

00:55.220 --> 00:57.220
and, on the contrary,

00:57.220 --> 01:00.220
to make adjustments to the management plans

01:00.220 --> 01:03.220
according to the parameters of the financial planning.

01:03.220 --> 01:08.220
Financial planning is based on the concept of money flows.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.220
You remember this scheme,

01:10.220 --> 01:14.220
this is the basic scheme of German financial management.

01:14.220 --> 01:20.220
This scheme allows us to look at the enterprise

01:20.220 --> 01:23.220
in a relationship with other enterprises.

01:23.220 --> 01:26.220
The scheme of money flows.

01:26.220 --> 01:31.220
Here we see how the enterprise is connected

01:31.220 --> 01:35.220
with other enterprises in the markets of production,

01:35.220 --> 01:37.220
in the markets of purchases.

01:37.220 --> 01:40.220
We have a state, we have financial markets

01:40.220 --> 01:43.220
from which the enterprise receives loans,

01:43.220 --> 01:47.220
and all this is aimed at one task,

01:47.220 --> 01:50.220
to ensure the continuity of money flows.

01:50.220 --> 01:53.220
We need to ensure liquidity.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.220
Therefore, in the planning phase,

01:56.220 --> 02:00.220
we first link commodity flows with financial flows

02:00.220 --> 02:04.220
and provide for all the upcoming payment obligations

02:04.220 --> 02:06.220
to be paid in due time

02:06.220 --> 02:09.220
to suppliers, to creditors,

02:09.220 --> 02:13.220
to employees of the enterprise on the salary,

02:13.220 --> 02:16.220
of course, to the state.

02:16.220 --> 02:22.220
Thus, the task is to cover all possible deficits in due time

02:22.220 --> 02:26.220
or, again, we do not forget that money should work,

02:26.220 --> 02:33.220
so we provide for the effective use of free financial resources,

02:33.220 --> 02:36.220
of surplus.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.220
The planning process involves a certain sequence,

02:39.220 --> 02:42.220
certain steps of planning.

02:42.220 --> 02:49.220
In general, they are universal and go in one scheme.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.220
First of all, we need to consider all commodity flows.

02:53.220 --> 02:58.220
What commodity flows we have from the markets of purchases,

02:58.220 --> 03:01.220
what resources we buy,

03:01.220 --> 03:03.220
how much, with what frequency,

03:03.220 --> 03:07.220
and, accordingly, we must determine how much financial funds

03:07.220 --> 03:10.220
will be needed for this in the financial planning.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.220
We must develop an investment plan,

03:13.220 --> 03:17.220
additional investments if we plan to expand activity

03:17.220 --> 03:21.220
or, in general, investments if we create a new enterprise.

03:21.220 --> 03:24.220
In parallel with the investment plan,

03:24.220 --> 03:28.220
accordingly, we have an amortization calculation plan.

03:28.220 --> 03:32.220
Then we must calculate the cost of revenue

03:32.220 --> 03:35.220
and calculate the cost for this revenue.

03:36.220 --> 03:39.220
In addition, when growing revenue,

03:39.220 --> 03:42.220
we must take into account that we will need

03:42.220 --> 03:44.220
some additional investments,

03:44.220 --> 03:47.220
investments in reserves.

03:47.220 --> 03:50.220
This is the sphere of turnover calculations,

03:50.220 --> 03:53.220
pure turnover capital.

03:55.220 --> 03:58.220
After that, we can start

03:58.220 --> 04:02.220
directly forming the main document of financial planning,

04:02.220 --> 04:05.220
the table of money flows.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.220
Well, first we can conditionally call this table

04:08.220 --> 04:11.220
the table of real commodity exchange.

04:11.220 --> 04:15.220
Here we apply only the positions

04:15.220 --> 04:18.220
associated with the movement of goods,

04:18.220 --> 04:22.220
namely, revenue, cost,

04:22.220 --> 04:28.220
the purchase of necessary machines, equipment,

04:29.220 --> 04:32.220
the creation of stock of return funds.

04:32.220 --> 04:35.220
The result of this table shows us

04:35.220 --> 04:38.220
the need for financing.

04:38.220 --> 04:41.220
This table is necessarily made up

04:41.220 --> 04:44.220
for the entire horizon of planning

04:44.220 --> 04:47.220
with a breakdown of planning steps.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.220
We are talking about a forecast document,

04:50.220 --> 04:54.220
a document that is made up for several years,

04:55.220 --> 04:58.220
at least 5 years, 3-5 years,

04:58.220 --> 05:02.220
and is broken down into smaller planning steps.

05:02.220 --> 05:06.220
In the simplest form, this is according to the years.

05:06.220 --> 05:09.220
Sometimes the features of planning,

05:09.220 --> 05:12.220
the features of the enterprise's activities

05:12.220 --> 05:15.220
can imply quarterly planning.

05:15.220 --> 05:18.220
Even forecast planning

05:18.220 --> 05:21.220
is a breakdown by quarters.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.220
We see that this table reflects all the flows

05:25.220 --> 05:28.220
and outflows of funds that are necessary

05:28.220 --> 05:31.220
for the maintenance of operational processes,

05:31.220 --> 05:34.220
real commodity exchange processes.

05:34.220 --> 05:37.220
Here is the sequence of components.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.220
Revenue from implementation,

05:40.220 --> 05:43.220
which comes to us from the marketing plan,

05:43.220 --> 05:46.220
how many goods, what price we produce,

05:46.220 --> 05:49.220
is reflected in the revenue,

05:49.220 --> 05:52.220
and the cost of the budget,

05:52.220 --> 05:55.220
the cost of the cost of the budget,

05:55.220 --> 05:58.220
is calculated.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.220
Next, we determine the need for investment.

06:01.220 --> 06:04.220
That is, the manufacturers calculate

06:04.220 --> 06:07.220
the number of machines.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.220
We calculate the money we need

06:10.220 --> 06:13.220
to purchase the main resources

06:13.220 --> 06:16.220
and to create a supply of return funds.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.220
And finally, this table,

06:19.220 --> 06:22.220
when we put the funding sources,

06:22.220 --> 06:25.220
provides liquidity.

06:25.220 --> 06:28.220
That is, the net cash flow is not negative.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.220
This is the parameter

06:31.220 --> 06:34.220
that guarantees the profitability of our business

06:34.220 --> 06:37.220
along with increasing profitability

06:37.220 --> 06:40.220
and profitability,

06:40.220 --> 06:43.220
the growth of the business's cost.

06:46.220 --> 06:49.220
This kind of table is simplified,

06:49.220 --> 06:52.220
but it allows us to summarize

06:52.220 --> 06:55.220
and show the interconnection

06:55.220 --> 06:58.220
of all inflows and outflows of funds.

06:58.220 --> 07:01.220
In practice, they are more often

07:01.220 --> 07:04.220
in a slightly different form.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.220
They divide the cash flows

07:07.220 --> 07:10.220
in the sphere of their occurrence,

07:10.220 --> 07:13.220
highlighting operational,

07:13.220 --> 07:16.220
investment and financial activity.

07:16.220 --> 07:19.220
This is a detailed scheme of cash flows

07:19.220 --> 07:22.220
in an electronic textbook.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.220
I ask you to carefully understand this scheme.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.220
It shows all accounting realities

07:28.220 --> 07:31.220
and the correspondence of these flows

07:31.220 --> 07:34.220
and the primary sources,

07:34.220 --> 07:37.220
what it means in accounting language

07:37.220 --> 07:40.220
and where the primary information

07:40.220 --> 07:43.220
is located.

07:43.220 --> 07:46.220
This table shows the inflows and outflows

07:46.220 --> 07:49.220
of funds and the financial result of the net cash flow.

07:49.220 --> 07:52.220
This is nothing more than a direct method

07:52.220 --> 07:55.220
of forecasting cash flows.

07:55.220 --> 07:58.220
I think it is very convenient and clear.

07:58.220 --> 08:01.220
The main goal of this table

08:01.220 --> 08:04.220
is not to miss any of the components

08:04.220 --> 08:07.220
of the cash flows.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.220
In addition to the direct method

08:10.220 --> 08:13.220
of forecasting cash flows,

08:13.220 --> 08:16.220
the broad spread received

08:16.220 --> 08:19.220
a indirect method of forecasting cash flows.

08:19.220 --> 08:22.220
That is, when we deduce

08:22.220 --> 08:25.220
our resulting indicator,

08:25.220 --> 08:28.220
the net cash flow,

08:28.220 --> 08:31.220
from the data of other financial documents.

08:31.220 --> 08:34.220
In a very simplified concept,

08:34.220 --> 08:37.220
the net cash flow is calculated

08:37.220 --> 08:40.220
from the total net profit,

08:40.220 --> 08:43.220
depreciation deductions,

08:43.220 --> 08:46.220
as well as the change in debt,

08:46.220 --> 08:49.220
plus or minus the credit and debit debt.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.220
These quantities are calculated

08:52.220 --> 08:55.220
at any enterprise

08:55.220 --> 08:58.220
according to accounting or planned forms,

08:58.220 --> 09:01.220
form 1 and form 2.

09:01.220 --> 09:04.220
Most companies use the indirect method

09:04.220 --> 09:07.220
because it is easy to use.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.220
If you look at the financial reports

09:10.220 --> 09:13.220
of international companies,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.220
you will see that after the main positions

09:16.220 --> 09:19.220
there is a turnover, a profit,

09:19.220 --> 09:22.220
and a cash flow.

09:22.220 --> 09:25.220
This is exactly what we get

09:25.220 --> 09:28.220
in the process of financial planning.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.220
In addition, I want to remind you

09:32.220 --> 09:35.220
that cash flows and horizon of planning

09:35.220 --> 09:38.220
are a matter of time.

09:38.220 --> 09:41.220
The cash flows we receive

09:41.220 --> 09:44.220
and pay out at different times

09:44.220 --> 09:47.220
are not equal to us.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.220
The later we get the financial result,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.220
the less interesting it is for us.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.220
I remind you about discounting,

09:56.220 --> 09:59.220
about how to provide data compatibility.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.220
If we want to calculate the financial result

10:02.220 --> 10:05.220
by the growing result,

10:05.220 --> 10:08.220
by summing up the net cash flow by years,

10:08.220 --> 10:11.220
we do not have the right to do this directly

10:11.220 --> 10:14.220
by adding up the net cash flow

10:14.220 --> 10:17.220
of the first period of 100 units,

10:17.220 --> 10:20.220
adding up the net cash flow

10:20.220 --> 10:23.220
of the second period of 100 units,

10:23.220 --> 10:26.220
these units are not equal to each other.

10:26.220 --> 10:29.220
Before adding them up,

10:29.220 --> 10:32.220
we need to discount them.

10:32.220 --> 10:35.220
In total, the discounted amount of the cash flow

10:35.220 --> 10:38.220
is equal to the total discounted value

10:38.220 --> 10:41.220
of the current value

10:41.220 --> 10:44.220
that summarizes the financial result

10:44.220 --> 10:47.220
of the activity during all periods of planning.

10:47.220 --> 10:50.220
This indicator is usually necessary

10:50.220 --> 10:53.220
for the development of a new enterprise.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.220
We are now starting to calculate

11:06.220 --> 11:09.220
the needs in investments.

11:09.220 --> 11:12.220
We should remember that this is

11:12.220 --> 11:15.220
the investment in property,

11:15.220 --> 11:18.220
in the assets of the enterprise.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.220
Investments are, in a broad sense,

11:21.220 --> 11:24.220
the use of capital,

11:24.220 --> 11:27.220
the linking of capital in production,

11:27.220 --> 11:30.220
the acquisition of property.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.220
On the diagram you can see

11:33.220 --> 11:36.220
the classification of investments

11:36.220 --> 11:39.220
and the division of investments

11:39.220 --> 11:42.220
into real and financial investments.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.220
Real investments are strategic decisions

11:45.220 --> 11:48.220
that are divided into forecast plans

11:48.220 --> 11:51.220
about the capital needed

11:51.220 --> 11:54.220
to purchase buildings,

11:54.220 --> 11:57.220
structures, machines and equipment,

11:57.220 --> 12:00.220
as well as the capital needed

12:00.220 --> 12:03.220
to create or increase stocks.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.220
Financial investments are planned

12:06.220 --> 12:09.220
as long-term investments

12:09.220 --> 12:12.220
in other enterprises,

12:12.220 --> 12:15.220
as well as short-term investments

12:15.220 --> 12:18.220
in short-term financial securities.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.220
The calculation of the needs of the investment

12:38.220 --> 12:41.220
includes the assessment of the necessary

12:41.220 --> 12:44.220
capital, the total cost of the necessary

12:44.220 --> 12:47.220
equipment, machines, structures,

12:47.220 --> 12:50.220
vehicles and other assets.

12:50.220 --> 12:53.220
These calculations are calculated

12:53.220 --> 12:56.220
in the production plan

12:56.220 --> 12:59.220
as part of the justification

12:59.220 --> 13:02.220
of the production capacity.

13:02.220 --> 13:05.220
They are connected with the established

13:05.220 --> 13:08.220
strategic plan,

13:08.220 --> 13:11.220
and are used in the final form.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.220
The only thing we pay attention to

13:14.220 --> 13:17.220
is the correct planning

13:17.220 --> 13:20.220
and calculation of amortization calculations.

13:20.220 --> 13:23.220
The next component of the investment

13:23.220 --> 13:26.220
is the turnover capital.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.220
It is the most important part

13:29.220 --> 13:32.220
of the strategic financial planning.

13:32.220 --> 13:35.220
The turnover capital

13:36.220 --> 13:39.220
is the most important part

13:39.220 --> 13:42.220
of the strategic financial planning.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.220
Why do we need it?

13:45.220 --> 13:48.220
There is always a barrier

13:48.220 --> 13:51.220
between the perception of this concept

13:51.220 --> 13:54.220
and the mixing of the turnover capital

13:54.220 --> 13:57.220
with the current activity,

13:57.220 --> 14:00.220
with direct acquisition

14:00.220 --> 14:03.220
and with the writing of raw materials.

14:03.220 --> 14:06.220
The turnover capital

14:06.220 --> 14:09.220
should be minimally necessary,

14:09.220 --> 14:12.220
but sufficient.

14:12.220 --> 14:15.220
If we create unnecessary reserves,

14:15.220 --> 14:18.220
it will affect the efficiency

14:18.220 --> 14:21.220
of our activities.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.220
A shortage of reserves

14:24.220 --> 14:27.220
can lead to breakdowns.

14:27.220 --> 14:30.220
The turnover capital

14:30.220 --> 14:33.220
should be minimally necessary

14:33.220 --> 14:36.220
and sufficient.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.220
The situation related to the calculation

14:39.220 --> 14:42.220
of the turnover capital is, for example,

14:42.220 --> 14:45.220
that there are no accessories in the warehouse,

14:45.220 --> 14:48.220
there is no position in the trading room,

14:48.220 --> 14:51.220
there is no fresh bread every day,

14:51.220 --> 14:54.220
or there is no money to pay from the accounts.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.220
The importance of the turnover capital

14:57.220 --> 15:00.220
is that it is the main asset

15:00.220 --> 15:03.220
that determines the value of the project.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.220
When the enterprise develops,

15:06.220 --> 15:09.220
the turnover capital increases,

15:09.220 --> 15:12.220
the enterprise reserves increase,

15:12.220 --> 15:15.220
and it is necessary to have certain funds.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.220
It should be remembered

15:18.220 --> 15:21.220
that in a commercial organization

15:21.220 --> 15:24.220
or a trading company,

15:24.220 --> 15:27.220
the turnover capital should not exceed

15:27.220 --> 15:30.220
the main capital.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.220
The calculation of the turnover capital

15:33.220 --> 15:36.220
follows the plan of revenue

15:36.220 --> 15:39.220
and the cost-benefit ratio.

15:39.220 --> 15:42.220
We use the existing data

15:42.220 --> 15:45.220
of the revenue,

15:45.220 --> 15:48.220
the cost of the finished product,

15:48.220 --> 15:51.220
and the cost of the material costs.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.220
These are the main parameters

15:55.220 --> 15:58.220
that we take from the strategic plan.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.220
From the annual, for example,

16:01.220 --> 16:04.220
from the meta,

16:04.220 --> 16:07.220
we remember that we have 360 days per year.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.220
According to these initial data,

16:10.220 --> 16:13.220
we proceed to the planning of the turnover capital,

16:13.220 --> 16:16.220
sequentially moving from each position

16:16.220 --> 16:19.220
of the current assets.

16:20.220 --> 16:23.220
We start planning, for example, the reserves.

16:23.220 --> 16:26.220
The amount of raw materials and materials

16:26.220 --> 16:29.220
depends on the supply interval.

16:29.220 --> 16:32.220
For example, if we receive materials

16:32.220 --> 16:35.220
every 10 days,

16:35.220 --> 16:38.220
it means that we have to form reserves

16:38.220 --> 16:41.220
for these 10 days.

16:41.220 --> 16:44.220
Therefore,

16:44.220 --> 16:47.220
we take raw materials

16:47.220 --> 16:50.220
and material costs,

16:50.220 --> 16:53.220
the daily reserve

16:53.220 --> 16:56.220
and the cost of the 10-day raw material reserve.

16:56.220 --> 16:59.220
In other words, the turnover capital

16:59.220 --> 17:02.220
that will work in the raw materials reserves.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.220
The next component is the unfinished production.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.220
This is a component, of course,

17:11.220 --> 17:14.220
only for production companies.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.220
We do not have such a problem.

17:17.220 --> 17:20.220
The cost of unfinished production

17:20.220 --> 17:23.220
depends on the length of the production cycle.

17:23.220 --> 17:26.220
Let's say we have 15 days.

17:26.220 --> 17:29.220
I will insert specific numbers

17:29.220 --> 17:32.220
so as not to give unnecessary designations.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.220
So that it is more clearly understood.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.220
In principle, it is very simple.

17:38.220 --> 17:41.220
The cost of unfinished production

17:41.220 --> 17:44.220
is the difference between the material costs

17:44.220 --> 17:47.220
and the cost of the finished product.

17:47.220 --> 17:50.220
And, accordingly,

17:50.220 --> 17:53.220
the cost of unfinished production

17:53.220 --> 17:56.220
is multiplied by 15 days.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.220
The next component

17:59.220 --> 18:02.220
of the turnover assets

18:02.220 --> 18:05.220
is the debitor's debt,

18:05.220 --> 18:08.220
which is formed due to the fact

18:08.220 --> 18:11.220
that the debt is not paid to the buyers.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.220
Accordingly, we do not get some part of the revenue.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.220
That's how much we give a delay.

18:17.220 --> 18:20.220
For example, 30 days.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.220
Debitor's debt.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.220
And then we can plan

18:26.220 --> 18:29.220
some minimum necessary

18:29.220 --> 18:32.220
remainder of the finished product in the warehouse.

18:32.220 --> 18:35.220
Let's say we have a warehouse

18:35.220 --> 18:38.220
where we store finished products.

18:38.220 --> 18:41.220
Let's say we store them for 3 days.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.220
This also means

18:44.220 --> 18:47.220
that we do not sell it immediately

18:47.220 --> 18:50.220
and, accordingly, do not get the revenue.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.220
And all these intervals of time,

18:53.220 --> 18:56.220
I ask you to remember the financial cycle,

18:56.220 --> 18:59.220
it's all interconnected.

18:59.220 --> 19:02.220
We put here nothing but points

19:02.220 --> 19:05.220
of the financial cycle.

19:05.220 --> 19:08.220
All these standards work

19:08.220 --> 19:11.220
and determine the amount of turnover capital.

19:11.220 --> 19:14.220
The more these standards,

19:14.220 --> 19:17.220
management standards,

19:17.220 --> 19:20.220
the more the amount of turnover capital.

19:20.220 --> 19:23.220
If we sum up the resulting component,

19:23.220 --> 19:26.220
the calculated component,

19:26.220 --> 19:29.220
we get the total amount

19:29.220 --> 19:32.220
of turnover capital.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.220
The turnover capital is the capital

19:35.220 --> 19:38.220
that must be invested in our reserves.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.220
But, of course,

19:41.220 --> 19:44.220
you immediately thought that

19:44.220 --> 19:47.220
along with the fact that we provide a repayment,

19:47.220 --> 19:50.220
we are also provided with a repayment.

19:50.220 --> 19:53.220
We have a debtor's debt

19:53.220 --> 19:56.220
that is multiple repayments.

19:56.220 --> 19:59.220
This means that we will pay

19:59.220 --> 20:02.220
for our resources

20:02.220 --> 20:05.220
45 days later.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.220
And for financial planning,

20:08.220 --> 20:11.220
we are actually interested in

20:11.220 --> 20:14.220
the amount of pure turnover capital.

20:14.220 --> 20:17.220
Pure turnover capital.

20:17.220 --> 20:20.220
Networking capital.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.220
This is exactly the amount

20:24.220 --> 20:27.220
that shows us the amount of money

20:27.220 --> 20:30.220
that is needed for investment

20:30.220 --> 20:33.220
along with the main capital.

20:33.220 --> 20:36.220
Plus the main capital.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.220
The less pure turnover capital,

20:39.220 --> 20:42.220
the shorter the financial cycle of the enterprise.

20:42.220 --> 20:45.220
Look, please,

20:45.220 --> 20:48.220
we get a normative financial cycle

20:48.220 --> 20:51.220
if we add up all our norms.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.220
We get 58 days.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.220
This is the operational cycle.

20:58.220 --> 21:01.220
And after 45 days,

21:01.220 --> 21:04.220
we get a 13-day financial cycle.

21:04.220 --> 21:07.220
The shorter the financial cycle,

21:07.220 --> 21:10.220
the faster we turn around,

21:10.220 --> 21:13.220
the more significant the financial results.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.220
In addition to this scrupulous method

21:16.220 --> 21:19.220
of calculating the turnover capital

21:19.220 --> 21:22.220
we can use the enlarged method

21:22.220 --> 21:25.220
based on the calculated turnover capital.

21:25.220 --> 21:28.220
We can calculate the turnover capital

21:28.220 --> 21:31.220
from each position of the turnover capital

21:31.220 --> 21:34.220
or enlarged.

21:34.220 --> 21:37.220
There is also another enlarged method

21:37.220 --> 21:40.220
of calculating the turnover capital.

21:40.220 --> 21:43.220
The normative is the turnover capital

21:43.220 --> 21:46.220
calculated at $100 per turn.

21:46.220 --> 21:49.220
If we have such a normative,

21:49.220 --> 21:52.220
we can multiply any planned annual turnover

21:52.220 --> 21:55.220
by this normative

21:55.220 --> 21:58.220
by adjusting the number of days in the period

21:58.220 --> 22:01.220
360 if we are talking about the annual period

22:01.220 --> 22:04.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

22:04.220 --> 22:07.220
Look, please.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.220
This is also a similar calculation,

22:10.220 --> 22:13.220
only here the number of days

22:13.220 --> 22:16.220
and the number of days in the period

22:16.220 --> 22:19.220
are determined separately.

22:19.220 --> 22:22.220
The turnover capital is $100.

22:22.220 --> 22:25.220
The turnover capital can be easily calculated

22:25.220 --> 22:28.220
by the cost of raw materials,

22:28.220 --> 22:31.220
amortization and other expenses

22:31.220 --> 22:34.220
and set the same normatives

22:34.220 --> 22:37.220
such as storage of raw materials in the warehouse,

22:37.220 --> 22:40.220
production time, storage of products in the warehouse,

22:40.220 --> 22:43.220
the cost of the customers,

22:43.220 --> 22:46.220
payment time and the cost of the suppliers

22:46.220 --> 22:49.220
and the total cost of stocks

22:49.220 --> 22:52.220
and the normative of the turnover capital

22:52.220 --> 22:55.220
at $100 per turn.

22:55.220 --> 22:58.220
This is the most convenient method

22:58.220 --> 23:01.220
to calculate the turnover capital.

23:01.220 --> 23:04.220
This is the main problem

23:04.220 --> 23:07.220
why the company does not have money.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.220
The first problem is that

23:10.220 --> 23:13.220
all the components are not taken into account,

23:13.220 --> 23:16.220
they are not properly taken into account,

23:16.220 --> 23:19.220
the components are not thought out

23:19.220 --> 23:22.220
or the normatives are taken into account

23:22.220 --> 23:25.220
when planning, but in reality the situation has changed

23:25.220 --> 23:28.220
and no operational measures have been taken.

23:28.220 --> 23:31.220
I want to emphasize the importance

23:31.220 --> 23:34.220
of calculating the turnover capital.

23:34.220 --> 23:37.220
The turnover capital is very mobile and variable.

23:37.220 --> 23:40.220
It is the first component that reacts

23:40.220 --> 23:43.220
to any changes in the market or within the company.

23:43.220 --> 23:46.220
The need to calculate the turnover capital

23:46.220 --> 23:49.220
and monitor business activity

23:49.220 --> 23:52.220
should be the basis of the work of financial services.

23:52.220 --> 23:55.220
To monitor, it is necessary to regularly

23:55.220 --> 23:58.220
control the balance of turnover funds,

23:58.220 --> 24:01.220
to monitor the options of the company

24:01.220 --> 24:04.220
to prevent breakdowns in any position.

24:04.220 --> 24:07.220
Either there are problems with the investors

24:07.220 --> 24:10.220
or something is not right in the production.

24:10.220 --> 24:13.220
Or the finished product is stored in the warehouse

24:13.220 --> 24:16.220
and it is necessary to put the marketing in order.

24:16.220 --> 24:19.220
I would like to draw your attention

24:19.220 --> 24:22.220
to the financial indicators.

24:22.220 --> 24:25.220
These are indicators,

24:25.220 --> 24:28.220
indicators of the turnover capital.

24:28.220 --> 24:31.220
They are like external indicators

24:31.220 --> 24:34.220
that easily react and show the situation

24:34.220 --> 24:37.220
in our company.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.220
Behind them is the system of organization

24:40.220 --> 24:43.220
of production processes,

24:43.220 --> 24:46.220
ensuring the production of surplus.

24:46.220 --> 24:49.220
But, of course, in the supply,

24:49.220 --> 24:52.220
for example, the head of the warehouse

24:52.220 --> 24:55.220
does not understand what the cost of stocks is.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.220
But he understands the parameter

24:59.220 --> 25:02.220
of 10 days of supply.

25:02.220 --> 25:05.220
Therefore, this parameter should be voiced.

25:05.220 --> 25:08.220
Unfinished production is a financial

25:08.220 --> 25:11.220
and economic parameter for the organizers.

25:11.220 --> 25:14.220
It is not clear, but 15 days

25:14.220 --> 25:17.220
is the norm for which the head,

25:17.220 --> 25:20.220
the head of the production

25:20.220 --> 25:23.220
or the master of the production

25:24.220 --> 25:27.220
or the master of the production

25:27.220 --> 25:30.220
or the master of the production

25:30.220 --> 25:33.220
or the master of the production.

25:33.220 --> 25:36.220
Debit and credit debt

25:36.220 --> 25:39.220
are already financial parameters

25:39.220 --> 25:42.220
and require a lot of work,

25:42.220 --> 25:45.220
meticulous work, regular work

25:45.220 --> 25:48.220
with suppliers and clients.

25:48.220 --> 25:51.220
This includes monitoring

25:51.220 --> 25:54.220
the quality of the supply.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.220
For example, you have a large

25:57.220 --> 26:00.220
trading company, a large supermarket,

26:00.220 --> 26:03.220
you need a supplier who can

26:03.220 --> 26:06.220
withstand the regularity of the supply.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.220
And you want to provide him with goods

26:09.220 --> 26:12.220
with a delay in payment.

26:12.220 --> 26:15.220
The more you provide suppliers

26:15.220 --> 26:18.220
with credit debt,

26:18.220 --> 26:21.220
the longer the delay

26:21.220 --> 26:24.220
is than the delay in the debit debt.

26:24.220 --> 26:27.220
The turnover is an indicator

26:27.220 --> 26:30.220
of business activity.

26:30.220 --> 26:33.220
If business activity increases,

26:33.220 --> 26:36.220
the turnover is released.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.220
If there is a slowdown in the process,

26:39.220 --> 26:42.220
a new injection is required

26:42.220 --> 26:45.220
into any of these components.

26:45.220 --> 26:48.220
Therefore, the debt is not

26:48.220 --> 26:51.220
to be neglected.

26:51.220 --> 26:54.220
How much money does it take

26:54.220 --> 26:57.220
to buy equipment?

26:57.220 --> 27:00.220
How much money does it take

27:00.220 --> 27:03.220
to create or increase

27:03.220 --> 27:06.220
the stock of equipment

27:06.220 --> 27:09.220
under the accepted program?

27:09.220 --> 27:12.220
Now we need to determine

27:12.220 --> 27:15.220
the sources of financing.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.220
The slide shows the development

27:18.220 --> 27:21.220
of the concept of financing

27:21.220 --> 27:24.220
from a narrow concept

27:24.220 --> 27:27.220
of financing to an expanded one.

27:27.220 --> 27:30.220
Under the concept of financing,

27:30.220 --> 27:33.220
there are all kinds of ways

27:33.220 --> 27:36.220
to provide capital

27:36.220 --> 27:39.220
based on management effects,

27:39.220 --> 27:42.220
to structure and allocate capital

27:42.220 --> 27:45.220
and to regulate the current

27:45.220 --> 27:48.220
and future cash flows.

27:48.220 --> 27:51.220
In short, financing is the attraction

27:51.220 --> 27:54.220
of money to cover the revealed

27:54.220 --> 27:57.220
capital needs.

27:57.220 --> 28:00.220
The sources of financing are presented

28:00.220 --> 28:03.220
in a table and are divided

28:03.220 --> 28:06.220
by the legal status of the investor

28:06.220 --> 28:09.220
and the capital.

28:09.220 --> 28:12.220
The position of the domestic balance

28:12.220 --> 28:15.220
is listed here.

28:15.220 --> 28:18.220
The capital is reflected

28:18.220 --> 28:21.220
in the section of capital and reserve,

28:21.220 --> 28:24.220
including positions

28:24.220 --> 28:27.220
starting from the fixed capital.

28:27.220 --> 28:30.220
The debt capital is a long-term

28:30.220 --> 28:33.220
and short-term obligation.

28:33.220 --> 28:36.220
External sources are those

28:36.220 --> 28:39.220
that come to our enterprise from outside,

28:39.220 --> 28:42.220
and internal sources are those

28:42.220 --> 28:45.220
that are formed during the enterprise.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.220
Here is an interesting example.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.220
The accumulated profit is like

28:51.220 --> 28:54.220
the component of your own capital,

28:54.220 --> 28:57.220
the so-called self-financing,

28:57.220 --> 29:00.220
the internal source of financing.

29:01.220 --> 29:04.220
The position of the debt and collection

29:04.220 --> 29:07.220
is an interesting one.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.220
The effect of financing is that

29:10.220 --> 29:13.220
these obligations are fulfilled

29:13.220 --> 29:16.220
with a certain delay.

29:16.220 --> 29:19.220
The payments of the current period

29:19.220 --> 29:22.220
are reduced. For example,

29:22.220 --> 29:25.220
the special value is deducted

29:25.220 --> 29:28.220
from the pension fund.

29:28.220 --> 29:31.220
The debt is not calculated

29:31.220 --> 29:34.220
and is calculated

29:34.220 --> 29:37.220
within the next 15 days.

29:37.220 --> 29:40.220
Within these 15 days,

29:40.220 --> 29:43.220
we have some amount of funds

29:43.220 --> 29:46.220
that we use as a source of financing.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.220
The specific source of financing

29:49.220 --> 29:52.220
is the financing of the re-laying

29:52.220 --> 29:55.220
and changing of the asset structure.

29:56.220 --> 29:59.220
We are talking about amortization.

29:59.220 --> 30:02.220
As you know, amortization payments

30:02.220 --> 30:05.220
are intended to compensate

30:05.220 --> 30:08.220
the cost of worn equipment

30:08.220 --> 30:11.220
after 10 years.

30:11.220 --> 30:14.220
Today, this money works

30:14.220 --> 30:17.220
and can be used to finance

30:17.220 --> 30:20.220
the current needs or even

30:20.220 --> 30:23.220
to finance the development

30:23.220 --> 30:26.220
of new machines,

30:26.220 --> 30:29.220
production areas,

30:29.220 --> 30:32.220
and trading areas.

30:32.220 --> 30:35.220
This allows to increase the revenue

30:35.220 --> 30:38.220
and to earn money

30:38.220 --> 30:41.220
to replace the worn equipment.

30:41.220 --> 30:44.220
These internal sources of financing

30:44.220 --> 30:47.220
are the highest qualifications

30:47.220 --> 30:50.220
of financial management.

30:50.220 --> 30:53.220
Financial managers are forced

30:53.220 --> 30:56.220
to work every single penny.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.220
Amortization payments are used

30:59.220 --> 31:02.220
to finance the reserve payments

31:02.220 --> 31:05.220
and the debt is sold.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.220
This is the factoring position

31:08.220 --> 31:11.220
of the source of financing.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.220
The division of the source of financing

31:14.220 --> 31:17.220
into long-term and short-term is clear.

31:17.220 --> 31:20.220
The long-term source of financing

31:20.220 --> 31:23.220
is the loan.

31:23.220 --> 31:26.220
The short-term source

31:26.220 --> 31:29.220
is the creditorial debt.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.220
The short-term financing

31:32.220 --> 31:35.220
is the most frequent

31:35.220 --> 31:38.220
and the most vital source

31:38.220 --> 31:41.220
of the credit.

31:41.220 --> 31:44.220
The short-term financing

31:44.220 --> 31:47.220
is the most frequent

31:47.220 --> 31:50.220
and the most vital source

31:50.220 --> 31:53.220
of the credit.

31:53.220 --> 31:56.220
In order to apply for the short-term financing,

31:56.220 --> 31:59.220
you need to take into account

31:59.220 --> 32:02.220
the existing realities,

32:02.220 --> 32:05.220
the possibility of obtaining

32:05.220 --> 32:08.220
short-term loans,

32:08.220 --> 32:11.220
their price,

32:11.220 --> 32:14.220
and the liquidity ratio.

32:14.220 --> 32:17.220
The creditors consider the liquidity ratio

32:17.220 --> 32:20.220
and determine the risk-takers

32:20.220 --> 32:23.220
and increase the loan rate

32:23.220 --> 32:26.220
according to this analysis.

32:26.220 --> 32:29.220
This is the Russian reality

32:29.220 --> 32:32.220
and the strict control

32:32.220 --> 32:35.220
of the amount of clean assets

32:35.220 --> 32:38.220
in the loan balance.

32:38.220 --> 32:41.220
The financing of the creditors

32:41.220 --> 32:44.220
is a very interesting and profitable

32:44.220 --> 32:47.220
article in the financing.

32:47.220 --> 32:50.220
It is a free financing.

32:50.220 --> 32:53.220
It is a free financing.

32:53.220 --> 32:56.220
Here you need to control

32:56.220 --> 32:59.220
the payment deadlines

32:59.220 --> 33:02.220
of the creditors and debitors

33:02.220 --> 33:05.220
so that there is no non-payment

33:05.220 --> 33:08.220
and the payment is profitable.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.220
For example,

33:11.220 --> 33:14.220
we did it in the account

33:14.220 --> 33:17.220
of the turnover capital.

33:17.220 --> 33:20.220
It was 45 days and 30 days,

33:20.220 --> 33:23.220
which gave us 15 days

33:23.220 --> 33:26.220
of opportunity.

33:26.220 --> 33:29.220
What else should be taken into account

33:29.220 --> 33:32.220
when we solve the issue of financing?

33:33.220 --> 33:36.220
An important component

33:36.220 --> 33:39.220
for a financial manager

33:39.220 --> 33:42.220
is the ability to save

33:42.220 --> 33:45.220
on tax payments.

33:45.220 --> 33:48.220
Simple mechanisms,

33:48.220 --> 33:51.220
such as interest rates,

33:51.220 --> 33:54.220
are included in the cost.

33:54.220 --> 33:57.220
In our realities,

33:57.220 --> 34:00.220
this is limited to the rate

34:00.220 --> 34:03.220
of the tax rate.

34:03.220 --> 34:06.220
In general,

34:06.220 --> 34:09.220
the rate of the tax rate

34:09.220 --> 34:12.220
is a powerful tool for saving

34:12.220 --> 34:15.220
on taxes around the world.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.220
It acquires different forms

34:18.220 --> 34:21.220
because a limited number

34:21.220 --> 34:24.220
of enterprises can really save

34:24.220 --> 34:27.220
by using the rate of the tax rate,

34:27.220 --> 34:30.220
but it is also provided

34:30.220 --> 34:33.220
that the amortization rate

34:33.220 --> 34:36.220
can be increased by 3 times.

34:36.220 --> 34:39.220
In addition,

34:39.220 --> 34:42.220
using leasing

34:42.220 --> 34:45.220
we save on one-time costs,

34:45.220 --> 34:48.220
on the costs of purchasing

34:48.220 --> 34:51.220
items, machines, and equipment.

34:51.220 --> 34:54.220
From a financial point of view,

34:54.220 --> 34:57.220
it is a great opportunity

34:57.220 --> 35:00.220
to save on taxes.

35:00.220 --> 35:03.220
Leasing payments

35:03.220 --> 35:06.220
with accelerated amortization,

35:06.220 --> 35:09.220
interest rates, insurance contributions,

35:09.220 --> 35:12.220
all costs are included

35:12.220 --> 35:15.220
and thus the taxable profit is reduced.

35:15.220 --> 35:18.220
These are the civilized ways

35:18.220 --> 35:21.220
to save on tax payments

35:21.220 --> 35:24.220
When we talk about determining

35:24.220 --> 35:27.220
the source of financing,

35:27.220 --> 35:30.220
we should remember the well-known

35:30.220 --> 35:33.220
rules of financing and the principles of financing.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.220
Let's look at the principles of financing

35:36.220 --> 35:39.220
on the slide presented.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.220
The first principle is economic value.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.220
What does it mean?

35:45.220 --> 35:48.220
The price at which we spend our financing,

35:48.220 --> 35:51.220
that is, the funds that we need

35:51.220 --> 35:54.220
to finance, we should attract

35:54.220 --> 35:57.220
with minimal costs.

35:57.220 --> 36:00.220
And if we have free excess funds,

36:00.220 --> 36:03.220
we should somehow use them

36:03.220 --> 36:06.220
profitably by investing in securities.

36:06.220 --> 36:09.220
The principle of purposeful use of funds

36:09.220 --> 36:12.220
is associated with the so-called

36:12.220 --> 36:15.220
golden rule of financing.

36:15.220 --> 36:18.220
Long-term sources of financing

36:18.220 --> 36:21.220
should be used to purchase

36:21.220 --> 36:24.220
machines, equipment,

36:24.220 --> 36:27.220
long-term items of property.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.220
Short-term sources of financing

36:30.220 --> 36:33.220
are used to finance current needs

36:33.220 --> 36:36.220
and to cover cash breaks.

36:36.220 --> 36:39.220
This is a clear rule,

36:39.220 --> 36:42.220
it should be so,

36:42.220 --> 36:45.220
and it should be used to purchase

36:45.220 --> 36:48.220
a machine, equipment,

36:48.220 --> 36:51.220
and other goods.

36:51.220 --> 36:54.220
The source of payment

36:54.220 --> 36:57.220
is always profit

36:57.220 --> 37:00.220
and amortization.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.220
Profit is an indicator

37:03.220 --> 37:06.220
that may not be.

37:06.220 --> 37:09.220
Amortization is 10% per year.

37:09.220 --> 37:12.220
And interest for a short-term loan.

37:12.220 --> 37:15.220
We recall the golden rule of financing

37:15.220 --> 37:18.220
again.

37:18.220 --> 37:21.220
Why is it so important?

37:21.220 --> 37:24.220
If we use short-term loans

37:24.220 --> 37:27.220
with a rate of 20% or more

37:27.220 --> 37:30.220
to purchase the main funds

37:30.220 --> 37:33.220
that have amortization of 10%,

37:33.220 --> 37:36.220
we are not eligible

37:36.220 --> 37:39.220
for new loans

37:39.220 --> 37:42.220
and new money.

37:42.220 --> 37:45.220
The next principle

37:45.220 --> 37:48.220
of financing is

37:48.220 --> 37:51.220
the independence of financing.

37:51.220 --> 37:54.220
When we use loans,

37:54.220 --> 37:57.220
we must somehow protect ourselves

37:57.220 --> 38:00.220
and minimize our risk.

38:00.220 --> 38:03.220
We also have a 50-50 rule.

38:03.220 --> 38:06.220
We measure the amount of loan

38:06.220 --> 38:09.220
with our own funds,

38:09.220 --> 38:12.220
limiting the size of the business

38:12.220 --> 38:15.220
to the size of our wallet.

38:15.220 --> 38:18.220
I remind you again

38:18.220 --> 38:21.220
that the security of financing

38:21.220 --> 38:24.220
is related to ensuring financial stability.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.220
We talked about it

38:27.220 --> 38:30.220
and said that it is a cornerstone

38:30.220 --> 38:33.220
of financial balance.

38:33.220 --> 38:36.220
In connection with the price of financing,

38:36.220 --> 38:39.220
the price of capital,

38:39.220 --> 38:42.220
balancing risk and profit,

38:42.220 --> 38:45.220
we can give an example.

38:45.220 --> 38:48.220
The expected profit of a company's share

38:48.220 --> 38:51.220
is 14%, and of bonds it is less than 9%.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.220
What does this mean in terms of risk?

38:54.220 --> 38:57.220
A higher profit of a share means

38:57.220 --> 39:00.220
that the company will be able to buy shares.

39:00.220 --> 39:03.220
In order to protect myself,

39:03.220 --> 39:06.220
I bought bonds.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.220
On the other hand,

39:09.220 --> 39:12.220
the management considers its own financing

39:12.220 --> 39:15.220
less risky,

39:15.220 --> 39:18.220
and therefore the managers are ready

39:18.220 --> 39:21.220
to pay a higher price for capital shares.

39:21.220 --> 39:24.220
We return to the sphere of our planning.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.220
The table of money flows

39:27.220 --> 39:30.220
shows the process of planning.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.220
This is a negative net cash flow

39:33.220 --> 39:36.220
on the balance of investment

39:36.220 --> 39:39.220
and operational activities.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.220
In other words,

39:42.220 --> 39:45.220
a negative balance of the real sphere.

39:45.220 --> 39:48.220
In order to cover these deficits

39:48.220 --> 39:51.220
and use certain sources of financing,

39:51.220 --> 39:54.220
we need to consider certain components.

39:54.220 --> 39:57.220
Please look at the slide,

39:57.220 --> 40:00.220
they are listed.

40:00.220 --> 40:03.220
First, the presence and size of our own capital.

40:03.220 --> 40:06.220
How much of our own money

40:06.220 --> 40:09.220
can we invest in the creation of a company

40:09.220 --> 40:12.220
or its development?

40:12.220 --> 40:15.220
On the other hand,

40:15.220 --> 40:18.220
the availability of credit financing.

40:18.220 --> 40:21.220
How much does it cost?

40:21.220 --> 40:24.220
What kind of credit is required?

40:24.220 --> 40:27.220
Is there such a thing?

40:27.220 --> 40:30.220
The target parameter is

40:30.220 --> 40:33.220
the maximization of income

40:33.220 --> 40:36.220
for the shareholder on capital.

40:36.220 --> 40:39.220
That is, the financial manager

40:39.220 --> 40:42.220
calculates the profitability of his own capital,

40:42.220 --> 40:45.220
the action of the financial lever.

40:46.220 --> 40:49.220
Financial investors are always interested

40:49.220 --> 40:52.220
in the moment of leaving the business.

40:52.220 --> 40:55.220
How easy it is to leave the business?

40:55.220 --> 40:58.220
At what stage can this company be sold?

40:58.220 --> 41:01.220
At what stage will this company be developed?

41:01.220 --> 41:04.220
For what price? Will there be buyers?

41:04.220 --> 41:07.220
And, of course, we are always interested

41:07.220 --> 41:10.220
in ensuring the flexibility of financing.

41:10.220 --> 41:13.220
In any case, if we plan our sources of financing,

41:13.220 --> 41:16.220
we must provide some reserve.

41:16.220 --> 41:19.220
If something goes wrong,

41:19.220 --> 41:22.220
as we planned,

41:22.220 --> 41:25.220
we can change something.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.220
For this, of course, money is needed.

41:28.220 --> 41:31.220
The general rule is that banks

41:31.220 --> 41:34.220
are the institutions where you will be given money

41:34.220 --> 41:37.220
when you do not need it.

41:37.220 --> 41:40.220
Banks are willing to lend to companies

41:40.220 --> 41:43.220
that have enough money.

41:43.220 --> 41:46.220
All these financing solutions

41:46.220 --> 41:49.220
form the target structure

41:49.220 --> 41:52.220
and the average price of capital.

41:52.220 --> 41:55.220
Counterplanning,

41:55.220 --> 41:58.220
making a table of money flows

41:58.220 --> 42:01.220
is a very convenient tool

42:01.220 --> 42:04.220
for modeling sources of financing.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.220
Here we see three standard options.

42:07.220 --> 42:10.220
The third option is an annuity.

42:10.220 --> 42:13.220
Payments are equal to the losses.

42:13.220 --> 42:16.220
For us, these orders and the financing schedule

42:16.220 --> 42:19.220
are not indifferent.

42:19.220 --> 42:22.220
We need to choose the one

42:22.220 --> 42:25.220
that is convenient for us

42:25.220 --> 42:28.220
in terms of money flows.

42:28.220 --> 42:31.220
We refer to our table of money flows

42:31.220 --> 42:34.220
and look at how,

42:34.220 --> 42:37.220
depending on how we expect

42:37.220 --> 42:40.220
the proceeds to come to us,

42:40.220 --> 42:43.220
how we will pay,

42:43.220 --> 42:46.220
what money flows will be generated

42:46.220 --> 42:49.220
in order to pay off the loan.

42:49.220 --> 42:52.220
We choose any of these options

42:52.220 --> 42:55.220
and arrange a schedule

42:55.220 --> 42:58.220
with the creditor.

42:58.220 --> 43:01.220
We include a special schedule

43:01.220 --> 43:04.220
for the first few months.

43:04.220 --> 43:07.220
This is especially important

43:07.220 --> 43:10.220
for large projects,

43:10.220 --> 43:13.220
investment projects,

43:13.220 --> 43:16.220
and enterprises.

43:16.220 --> 43:19.220
An enterprise that will be built

43:19.220 --> 43:22.220
in 2-5 years can start paying off a loan.

43:22.220 --> 43:25.220
This is not realistic.

43:25.220 --> 43:28.220
All these options are possible.

43:28.220 --> 43:31.220
In general,

43:31.220 --> 43:34.220
it is important to take a loan

43:34.220 --> 43:37.220
academically and in real life.

43:37.220 --> 43:40.220
The strategic decision

43:40.220 --> 43:43.220
that top managers make

43:43.220 --> 43:46.220
is related to the financial lever.

43:46.220 --> 43:49.220
I have already mentioned it several times.

43:49.220 --> 43:52.220
You know that the financial lever

43:52.220 --> 43:55.220
describes the profitability

43:56.220 --> 43:59.220
of your own capital.

43:59.220 --> 44:02.220
It is related to the profitability

44:02.220 --> 44:05.220
of your own capital,

44:05.220 --> 44:08.220
which shows the dependence

44:08.220 --> 44:11.220
of your own capital on the profitability

44:11.220 --> 44:14.220
of assets and financial stability.

44:14.220 --> 44:17.220
Here we have nothing but the coefficient

44:17.220 --> 44:20.220
of financial autonomy.

44:20.220 --> 44:23.220
The financial lever talks about

44:23.220 --> 44:26.220
financing and financing risks.

44:26.220 --> 44:29.220
It is based on the profitability model.

44:29.220 --> 44:32.220
The goal of lending

44:32.220 --> 44:35.220
is to increase the profitability

44:35.220 --> 44:38.220
of shareholders and to increase

44:38.220 --> 44:41.220
the return on capital.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.220
This can be achieved by taking a risk

44:44.220 --> 44:47.220
and taking an additional loan.

44:47.220 --> 44:50.220
This decision will be justified

44:50.220 --> 44:53.220
if the interest rate on the loan

44:53.220 --> 44:56.220
exceeds the profitability

44:56.220 --> 44:59.220
of the assets.

44:59.220 --> 45:02.220
In this case,

45:02.220 --> 45:05.220
the financial stability changes,

45:05.220 --> 45:08.220
the share of your own capital decreases.

45:08.220 --> 45:11.220
This is a simple situation.

45:11.220 --> 45:14.220
We get the growth

45:14.220 --> 45:17.220
of the profitability of our own capital.

45:17.220 --> 45:20.220
I will ask you to take examples

45:20.220 --> 45:23.220
of calculations and models

45:23.220 --> 45:26.220
of loan calculations in your notebook.

45:26.220 --> 45:29.220
I will ask you to remember

45:29.220 --> 45:32.220
the financial lever and profitability model.

45:32.220 --> 45:35.220
I will ask you to analyze these tasks

45:35.220 --> 45:38.220
and try to apply them

45:38.220 --> 45:41.220
to your real life,

45:41.220 --> 45:44.220
to the activities of your company

45:44.220 --> 45:47.220
and to use them in your practice.

45:47.220 --> 45:50.220
Our main goal is to help you

45:50.220 --> 45:53.220
solve problems in business.

45:53.220 --> 45:56.220
We analyze very popularly.

45:56.220 --> 45:59.220
I try to give you the basics

45:59.220 --> 46:02.220
of financial planning.

46:02.220 --> 46:05.220
We have programs and complexes

46:05.220 --> 46:08.220
for financial planning.

46:08.220 --> 46:11.220
Automation.

46:11.220 --> 46:14.220
To use the tools correctly,

46:14.220 --> 46:17.220
you need to understand

46:17.220 --> 46:20.220
what you want.

46:20.220 --> 46:23.220
What are the final strategic parameters

46:23.220 --> 46:26.220
you want to achieve?

46:26.220 --> 46:29.220
We always remember profitability and risk.

46:29.220 --> 46:32.220
Our profitability and risk of financial stability.

46:32.220 --> 46:35.220
This is a little tour back

46:35.220 --> 46:38.220
to the topic of financial management.

46:39.220 --> 46:42.220
We use all the financial principles

46:42.220 --> 46:45.220
and rules.

46:45.220 --> 46:48.220
Plus the availability of financial tools.

46:48.220 --> 46:51.220
We choose a convenient scheme

46:51.220 --> 46:54.220
of financing suitable for our company

46:54.220 --> 46:57.220
from the point of view of expected

46:57.220 --> 47:00.220
inflows and outflows of funds.

47:00.220 --> 47:03.220
What do we want to get from this financing?

47:03.220 --> 47:06.220
We have achieved a very good financial plan.

47:07.220 --> 47:10.220
We have achieved a strategic goal.

47:10.220 --> 47:13.220
These issues are solved in the process

47:13.220 --> 47:16.220
of routine planning.

47:16.220 --> 47:19.220
We choose a convenient scheme of financing,

47:19.220 --> 47:22.220
not an optimal one.

47:22.220 --> 47:25.220
We leave the concept of optimal financing

47:25.220 --> 47:28.220
to the theorists.

47:28.220 --> 47:31.220
However, if you want to receive a Nobel Prize,

47:31.220 --> 47:34.220
this is the area where I wish you success.

47:36.220 --> 47:39.220
Financial Planning

47:39.220 --> 47:42.220
What is the basis of financial planning?

47:42.220 --> 47:45.220
After we have planned the money flows,

47:45.220 --> 47:48.220
we move on to other documents

47:48.220 --> 47:51.220
of the financial plan.

47:51.220 --> 47:54.220
You have already been asked in Parava

47:54.220 --> 47:57.220
about money flows, cash flow, etc.

47:57.220 --> 48:00.220
Money flows are the basis of financial planning.

48:00.220 --> 48:03.220
But in addition to the fact that we make money flows

48:03.220 --> 48:06.220
and control liquidity,

48:06.220 --> 48:09.220
we also make a plan balance

48:09.220 --> 48:12.220
and a profit plan.

48:12.220 --> 48:15.220
These documents are necessary

48:15.220 --> 48:18.220
to transmit information,

48:18.220 --> 48:21.220
to exchange information

48:21.220 --> 48:24.220
from one form to another.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.220
It is impossible to make a profit plan

48:27.220 --> 48:30.220
without a profit plan.

48:30.220 --> 48:33.220
We can calculate the financial coefficients

48:33.220 --> 48:36.220
corresponding to our strategic goals,

48:36.220 --> 48:39.220
analyze the planned data,

48:39.220 --> 48:42.220
what parameters we get,

48:42.220 --> 48:45.220
profitability and risk,

48:45.220 --> 48:48.220
and, if necessary, make changes,

48:48.220 --> 48:51.220
review the planned task,

48:51.220 --> 48:54.220
pull up all our planning stages,

48:54.220 --> 48:57.220
decide on the next steps,

48:57.220 --> 49:00.220
and make strategic parameters

49:00.220 --> 49:03.220
and set the tactical standards.

49:13.220 --> 49:16.220
We plan the business balance.

49:16.220 --> 49:19.220
The plan balance is also a table,

49:19.220 --> 49:22.220
a strategic plan,

49:22.220 --> 49:25.220
a forecast balance,

49:26.220 --> 49:29.220
a balance sheet,

49:29.220 --> 49:32.220
the positions in the balance are the same,

49:32.220 --> 49:35.220
but the balances are also made

49:35.220 --> 49:38.220
for the entire horizon of planning,

49:38.220 --> 49:41.220
by year.

49:41.220 --> 49:44.220
By the end of each planned year,

49:44.220 --> 49:47.220
we set the positions in the balance

49:47.220 --> 49:50.220
corresponding to our decisions

49:50.220 --> 49:53.220
on investments and financing.

49:56.220 --> 49:59.220
In this forecast balance,

49:59.220 --> 50:02.220
we get information

50:02.220 --> 50:05.220
about where the funds came from,

50:05.220 --> 50:08.220
the sources of financing, passives,

50:08.220 --> 50:11.220
how they were used.

50:11.220 --> 50:14.220
Look at the slide.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.220
The balance scheme.

50:17.220 --> 50:20.220
The asset is on the left,

50:20.220 --> 50:23.220
the passive is on the right.

50:24.220 --> 50:27.220
The logical scheme.

50:27.220 --> 50:30.220
What is the balance?

50:30.220 --> 50:33.220
In passives, the sources of financing,

50:33.220 --> 50:36.220
in assets, how investments were used.

50:36.220 --> 50:39.220
The passive shows what funds are invested,

50:39.220 --> 50:42.220
what capital is invested.

50:42.220 --> 50:45.220
The asset shows what property the enterprise has.

50:45.220 --> 50:48.220
What should others do in passives?

50:48.220 --> 50:51.220
What is the owner's own capital?

50:51.220 --> 50:54.220
We see that these are two components

50:54.220 --> 50:57.220
of one whole.

50:57.220 --> 51:00.220
Financing and investments.

51:00.220 --> 51:03.220
We see that these are two components

51:03.220 --> 51:06.220
of one whole.

51:06.220 --> 51:09.220
Financing and investments.

51:09.220 --> 51:12.220
There is no investment without financing,

51:12.220 --> 51:15.220
and no financing without investment.

51:15.220 --> 51:18.220
Here is our balance.

51:18.220 --> 51:21.220
The balance is equal to the sum.

51:24.220 --> 51:27.220
The asset structure.

51:27.220 --> 51:30.220
How does the asset structure work in the balance?

51:30.220 --> 51:33.220
We transfer all our strategic investment decisions here.

51:33.220 --> 51:36.220
We transfer all our strategic investment decisions here.

51:36.220 --> 51:39.220
If we buy equipment,

51:39.220 --> 51:42.220
we get a position in the balance.

51:42.220 --> 51:45.220
If we use leasing,

51:45.220 --> 51:48.220
we do not get any investment.

51:48.220 --> 51:51.220
Leasing is a current aspect of activity.

51:51.220 --> 51:54.220
Leasing payments are reflected

51:54.220 --> 51:57.220
in the profit plan,

51:57.220 --> 52:00.220
in the cost, in the second form of accounting.

52:00.220 --> 52:03.220
That is, the assets in the balance

52:03.220 --> 52:06.220
are associated with the investment plan

52:06.220 --> 52:09.220
and with the section Investments,

52:09.220 --> 52:12.220
the table of money flows.

52:12.220 --> 52:15.220
These are the assets that are left

52:15.220 --> 52:18.220
in accordance with the decisions on financing.

52:18.220 --> 52:21.220
What funds do we use?

52:21.220 --> 52:24.220
Our own capital in the form of initial investments,

52:24.220 --> 52:27.220
in the form of accumulated profits

52:27.220 --> 52:30.220
in the process of activity,

52:30.220 --> 52:33.220
or the borrowed capital

52:33.220 --> 52:36.220
that we use.

52:36.220 --> 52:39.220
As the enterprise develops,

52:39.220 --> 52:42.220
internal sources are reflected in the enterprise balance.

52:42.220 --> 52:45.220
For example, the accumulated profit.

52:45.220 --> 52:48.220
The capital itself increases.

52:48.220 --> 52:51.220
If the enterprise works with losses,

52:51.220 --> 52:54.220
the capital itself is depleted.

52:54.220 --> 52:57.220
This is an extremely unfavorable situation.

52:57.220 --> 53:00.220
We can use such a balance

53:00.220 --> 53:03.220
to calculate financial coefficients.

53:03.220 --> 53:06.220
But not quite like that,

53:06.220 --> 53:09.220
it is better to use a converted balance.

53:09.220 --> 53:12.220
Financial coefficients are assumed

53:12.220 --> 53:15.220
to be converted into a balance.

53:15.220 --> 53:18.220
How?

53:18.220 --> 53:21.220
From the passives, the credit debt is transferred

53:21.220 --> 53:24.220
to the assets with a minus sign.

53:24.220 --> 53:27.220
As if we said that the credit debt

53:27.220 --> 53:30.220
covers our need for turnover capital.

53:30.220 --> 53:33.220
And the turnover assets for the withdrawal

53:33.220 --> 53:36.220
of the enterprise.

53:36.220 --> 53:39.220
In the form of an analytical balance,

53:39.220 --> 53:42.220
it shows

53:42.220 --> 53:45.220
what funds the enterprise has invested in assets,

53:45.220 --> 53:48.220
what capital was used,

53:48.220 --> 53:51.220
and what assets our enterprise has.

53:51.220 --> 53:54.220
Here is the balance.

53:54.220 --> 53:57.220
How is the balance presented?

53:57.220 --> 54:00.220
You already know

54:01.220 --> 54:04.220
the rules of financing.

54:04.220 --> 54:07.220
We can control the balance

54:07.220 --> 54:10.220
by comparing the capital itself

54:10.220 --> 54:13.220
with the non-turnover assets.

54:13.220 --> 54:16.220
The capital itself with the borrowed capital.

54:16.220 --> 54:19.220
Horizontally and vertically.

54:19.220 --> 54:22.220
We check the financial stability.

54:22.220 --> 54:25.220
The profit plan is an important document.

54:25.220 --> 54:28.220
The profitability of the enterprise

54:29.220 --> 54:32.220
was and remains the most important parameter

54:32.220 --> 54:35.220
of the efficiency of the enterprise.

54:35.220 --> 54:38.220
The profit plan includes

54:38.220 --> 54:41.220
the income and expenditure positions.

54:41.220 --> 54:44.220
It reflects the current results of the enterprise.

54:44.220 --> 54:47.220
The profit plan is usually made

54:47.220 --> 54:50.220
when we create an enterprise

54:50.220 --> 54:53.220
only after the start of the production process.

54:53.220 --> 54:56.220
It reflects the revenue,

54:56.220 --> 54:59.220
the current costs,

54:59.220 --> 55:02.220
and the cost of the enterprise.

55:02.220 --> 55:05.220
In order to make a profit plan,

55:05.220 --> 55:08.220
we use production plans,

55:08.220 --> 55:11.220
marketing plans,

55:11.220 --> 55:14.220
and the corresponding budgetary spending.

55:14.220 --> 55:17.220
We do not consider the budgetary technique

55:17.220 --> 55:20.220
within our course.

55:20.220 --> 55:23.220
It is a separate subject.

55:23.220 --> 55:26.220
But, of course,

55:26.220 --> 55:29.220
there is no financial planning without a budget.

55:29.220 --> 55:32.220
I will ask you to look at the table

55:32.220 --> 55:35.220
in detail how the income and expenditure

55:35.220 --> 55:38.220
of the enterprise are formed.

55:38.220 --> 55:41.220
It is a detailed and expanded table

55:41.220 --> 55:44.220
that I have compiled for you in the textbook.

55:44.220 --> 55:47.220
Another interesting point

55:47.220 --> 55:50.220
that we can touch upon is our modernity.

55:50.220 --> 55:53.220
How do we plan the revenue?

55:53.220 --> 55:56.220
How do we predict the revenue?

55:56.220 --> 55:59.220
First of all,

55:59.220 --> 56:02.220
the growth of the revenue is one of the most important

56:02.220 --> 56:05.220
goals of many companies.

56:05.220 --> 56:08.220
A company can set an annual revenue growth

56:08.220 --> 56:11.220
of 10%, for example,

56:11.220 --> 56:14.220
or set a goal to achieve a certain revenue

56:14.220 --> 56:17.220
in 3 years, 5 years, or more.

56:18.220 --> 56:21.220
To predict the revenue,

56:21.220 --> 56:24.220
we can use a very interesting model

56:24.220 --> 56:27.220
of achievable growth.

56:27.220 --> 56:30.220
It is shown on the slide.

56:30.220 --> 56:33.220
It is quite a complex model.

56:33.220 --> 56:36.220
To understand how it works,

56:36.220 --> 56:39.220
we can look at the example

56:39.220 --> 56:42.220
that is shown in the textbook.

56:42.220 --> 56:45.220
This model can be trusted.

56:46.220 --> 56:49.220
It shows how to develop,

56:49.220 --> 56:52.220
how to achieve the revenue

56:52.220 --> 56:55.220
with certain parameters.

56:55.220 --> 56:58.220
Moreover,

56:58.220 --> 57:01.220
you can use any target parameters in this model,

57:01.220 --> 57:04.220
or a certain profitability of sales,

57:04.220 --> 57:07.220
or turnover of assets,

57:07.220 --> 57:10.220
or some target capital structure

57:10.220 --> 57:13.220
in relation to your own and borrowed funds.

57:14.220 --> 57:17.220
It is not difficult to calculate the revenue

57:17.220 --> 57:20.220
using electronic tables.

57:20.220 --> 57:23.220
You can see how it works in the textbook.

57:23.220 --> 57:26.220
This model is used.

57:26.220 --> 57:29.220
If it turns out that the planned revenue

57:29.220 --> 57:32.220
calculated according to this model is not enough,

57:32.220 --> 57:35.220
does not correspond to our desires,

57:35.220 --> 57:38.220
ambitions, and the strategy adopted,

57:38.220 --> 57:41.220
we must correct the limitations

57:42.220 --> 57:45.220
and sacrifice financial stability

57:45.220 --> 57:48.220
and increase the share of borrowed capital.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.220
The plan of revenue is a tax instrument.

57:56.220 --> 57:59.220
We determine what taxes we will pay

57:59.220 --> 58:02.220
according to the plan of revenue.

58:02.220 --> 58:05.220
The payment of taxes

58:05.220 --> 58:08.220
is converted from the plan of revenue

58:08.220 --> 58:11.220
to the position of the flow of the payment.

58:11.220 --> 58:14.220
The plan of revenue

58:14.220 --> 58:17.220
assumes a certain optimization of tax payments.

58:17.220 --> 58:20.220
Financial managers,

58:20.220 --> 58:23.220
taking into account a certain accounting policy,

58:23.220 --> 58:26.220
use a rich arsenal of profit maneuvering.

58:26.220 --> 58:29.220
I recommend you to use

58:29.220 --> 58:32.220
the plan of revenue

58:32.220 --> 58:35.220
and the plan of revenue

58:36.220 --> 58:39.220
to manage the revenue.

58:39.220 --> 58:42.220
The textbooks and sections of Professor Kovalyov

58:42.220 --> 58:45.220
are dedicated to this topic.

58:45.220 --> 58:48.220
It is a very interesting topic.

58:48.220 --> 58:51.220
It is a topic of research.

58:51.220 --> 58:54.220
The qualification of a financial manager

58:54.220 --> 58:57.220
is related to the possibility

58:57.220 --> 59:00.220
of optimizing tax payments.

59:00.220 --> 59:03.220
We have already mentioned

59:04.220 --> 59:07.220
accelerated monetization,

59:07.220 --> 59:10.220
revaluation of fund assets,

59:10.220 --> 59:13.220
leasing,

59:13.220 --> 59:16.220
accounting for expenses,

59:16.220 --> 59:19.220
interest on credit,

59:19.220 --> 59:22.220
and so on.

59:22.220 --> 59:25.220
It is very interesting and useful.

59:25.220 --> 59:28.220
We all do not like to pay taxes,

59:28.220 --> 59:31.220
but we must pay them

59:31.220 --> 59:34.220
to protect our state.

59:34.220 --> 59:37.220
The state receives a share of our income.

59:40.220 --> 59:43.220
Another interesting point

59:43.220 --> 59:46.220
that we must take into account

59:46.220 --> 59:49.220
is the calculation of cost.

59:49.220 --> 59:52.220
Budgeting,

59:52.220 --> 59:55.220
budget technology

59:55.220 --> 59:58.220
is a separate topic.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.220
However, we must take into account

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:05.220
the following things.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.220
We must remember that we have

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.220
variable and conditional expenses.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.220
As soon as we forget about it,

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.220
we will have problems

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.220
and we will have a bad planning.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.220
Why?

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.220
It is not easy to divide

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.220
variable and conditional expenses

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.220
by their quantity.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.220
If I ask a student,

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.220
he will answer me without any hitches

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.220
that variable expenses are the main income,

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.220
the main material is the main income,

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.220
and the conditional expenses are the rent,

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.220
amortization, etc.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.220
We often use the word

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.220
conditional and constant.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.220
To divide these expenses

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.220
is not the main goal.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.220
We must remember the trends.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.220
The higher the constant expenses,

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.220
the greater the risk of being in deficit.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.220
We remember the operation lever.

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.220
The more we pay,

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.220
the more we lose.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.220
We must measure our ambitions.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.220
For example,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.220
we must rent an office in the center of Moscow

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.220
with a suitable rent.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.220
We must provide the appropriate turnover,

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.220
consulting package and the appropriate volume

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.220
of services.

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.220
If we forget about the constant expenses,

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.220
if we do not make a note

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.220
at the end of the plan

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.220
of the element of analysis of the loss,

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.220
and such a line as the definition

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.220
of the loss volume of sales

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.220
and the reserve of financial strength

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.220
as an assessment of the risk,

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.220
we can get into a bad situation

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.220
and be in loss when our revenue,

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.220
our marginal income,

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.220
does not cover our variable expenses.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.220
I remind you again

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.220
about the two components

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.220
of profitability and risk.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.220
Very roughly and in a large way

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.220
in planning, of course,

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.220
in the profit plan,

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.220
when we have a cost,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.220
we represent variable expenses

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.220
that change proportionally in revenue.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.220
These variable expenses

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.220
must be justified,

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.220
they must have the appropriate standards.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.220
These standards can be taken into account.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.220
The scrupulous planning offers

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.220
a scrupulous calculation of all components

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.220
of variable expenses and the standards

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.220
for the ruble per unit per ton.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.220
The universal meter is, of course,

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:18.220
the variable expenses

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.220
in the calculation of the ruble of revenue.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.220
Current expenses are constant variables.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.220
This is a fundamental point.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.220
In addition,

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.220
there is a very common

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.220
and outrageous case

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.220
when the current expenses

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.220
and the capital expenses are mixed.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.220
We are talking about the core moments

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.220
of profit planning.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.220
Profit, the second part of the balance,

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.220
the second form of accountability

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.220
is associated with the current results of activities.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.220
Only the current expenses are reflected

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:03.220
in the corresponding expenses.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.220
The current expenses

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.220
affect the balance positions.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.220
What example can be given of a mixture?

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.220
A new company is created

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.220
and before the start of the operating processes

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.220
at the moment of the creation of the enterprise,

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.220
registration of the enterprise,

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.220
there are expenses that seem to be current.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.220
The expenses of the salary of the accountant.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.220
These expenses cannot be written off

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.220
for revenue before the start of the production process.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.220
They are the balance positions.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.220
Such expenses that seem to be current

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.220
are actually capital.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.220
They must be carried out

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.220
with the corresponding accounting procedures

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.220
and are reflected in the balance

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.220
as future period expenses,

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.220
which are the current expenses.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.220
This means that losses are formed

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.220
at the enterprise,

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.220
these losses increase,

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.220
they then go to the enterprise balance,

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.220
they exhaust their own capital.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.220
The net assets of the enterprise are negative

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.220
and with such a balance

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.220
you do not have to count on a loan.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.220
We have already touched on these concepts today.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.220
And once again,

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220
we summarize the results of the expenses

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.220
in terms of profit,

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.220
inflows and outflows in the money flows.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.220
There is no coarser mistake

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.220
in economic judgments,

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.220
as the academician Novozhilov once said,

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.220
than a mixture of income and expenses

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.220
We have already given examples many times.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.220
Why is there a difference between

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.220
the concept of profit and cash flow?

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.220
Because we have the results of activity,

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.220
for example, revenue,

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.220
which is not always an inflow

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.220
of funds to the force of the debtor's debt.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:15.220
As part of the expenses,

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:18.220
we have a wonderful article

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.220
which does not mean outflows,

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.220
it is not paid out in the current period,

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.220
it accumulates in the amortization calculation

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.220
and affects the financial result.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.220
So, we have touched upon

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.220
the basics of money flows planning,

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.220
liquidity table,

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.220
cash flow,

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.220
planned balances,

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.220
and profit.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.220
All these tables are interconnected,

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.220
they are made parallel

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.220
and separate positions

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.220
go from one document to another.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.220
For example, in terms of money flows,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.220
we determine the possibility of a loan,

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.220
financing the loan account.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.220
Loan accounts affect the balance position.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.220
We design the cost for interest payments.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.220
And then, in turn,

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.220
we calculate the tax on the profit

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.220
and use a new position

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.220
and transfer it to the money flows plan.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.220
Only after the profit is made

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.220
we get a table of tax payments.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.220
Here is a simple example

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.220
of my teacher, Professor Zelia.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.220
He is a professor at the University of Bremen.

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.220
Here is a simple example

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.220
of how to create an enterprise.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.220
We can see the relationship

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.220
between finance and accounting.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.220
Let's say, in the first year

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.220
we created an enterprise

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.220
and invested our own capital.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.220
Here we see the investment of our own capital

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:09.220
in the passive and passive funds

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.220
as a fixed capital

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.220
and reflected as a flow of funds

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.220
in terms of liquidity.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.220
The net cash flow is plus 40.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.220
Next year, in the next period,

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.220
we buy machines and equipment

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.220
for the money we have

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.220
and create a reserve of return funds.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:36.220
In terms of liquidity,

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.220
we have negative sales

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.220
and negative net cash flow,

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.220
which means a decrease in money

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.220
on the account.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.220
Look, 0 was 40,

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.220
net cash flow minus 40 became 0.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.220
We have stretched it a little

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.220
for clarity.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.220
Now we are talking about an active enterprise.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.220
It is easier to see these points

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.220
when we talk about creating an enterprise.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.220
Finally, in the third period,

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.220
we start the production of goods,

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:18.220
sales of goods,

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.220
and the profit plan appears.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.220
Profit is formed,

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.220
tax is formed,

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.220
and in the flow of funds

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.220
we reflect the cost

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.220
for the withdrawal of amortization payments.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.220
In the profit plan,

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.220
we have the total cost of 53 units.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.220
In the balance sheet,

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.220
new positions appear,

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.220
the tax for the profit of this period.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.220
Here, it is reflected as a budget calculation,

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.220
and the next year we continue

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.220
the production process,

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.220
taxes are paid,

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.220
revenue from the implementation

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.220
as a flow of funds is received,

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.220
we pay for our current

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.220
use of resources,

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.220
and since we planned well,

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.220
everything is correct,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.220
we are getting richer.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:33.220
Thus, we have considered

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.220
all the processes and documents

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.220
of long-term financial planning.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.220
How to make a money flow plan,

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:45.220
how to make a profit plan,

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:48.220
how to make balances.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.220
According to these documents,

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.220
we will see how the company

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.220
will generate a pure money flow,

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.220
what needs will appear in investments

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.220
and external financing,

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.220
and when it will appear,

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.220
at what time.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:12.220
Then we will be able to assess

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.220
the possibility of termination of debt,

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.220
we can track the change

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.220
in the balance of property,

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.220
the structure of capital,

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.220
we will definitely take measures

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.220
to optimize the tax payments,

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.220
we will plan the payment of dividends,

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.220
and finally,

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:39.220
we will calculate the financial state,

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.220
we will assess the profitability

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.220
and risk of activity

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.220
in the standard indicators.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.220
We will now consider

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.220
the specifics of short-term planning.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.220
It consists of assessing the current

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.220
needs of financial funds

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.220
and determining short-term

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.220
external and internal sources.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.220
External sources are loans and loans,

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.220
and the debt to suppliers and contractors.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.220
Internal sources are the debt

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.220
on taxes and fees,

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.220
sessions, factoring and forfeiting

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.220
as an element of the debt management.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.220
Short-term sources are

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.220
the debt on the debt collection,

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:43.220
the debt on the debt collection.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.220
Short-term financing sources are

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.220
overdrafts, credit loans.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.220
The definition of the current need

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.220
in short-term financial funds

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.220
is carried out with a special table

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.220
of money flows called a cash plan.

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.220
We emphasize that this is

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.220
a short-term document.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.220
The cash plan is made up of

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.220
a month or a shorter period.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:16.220
Please look at the slide.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.220
The main contents of the cash plan are presented.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.220
The cash plan includes

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.220
sales receipts,

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:28.220
operating payments,

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.220
payment of supplies,

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:34.220
and all this is done in short-term

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.220
cash plan.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.220
Next, I suggest you look at

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.220
routine planning processes.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.220
Again, this is a simplified example.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.220
We have accounting data for December.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.220
Next slide, please.

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.220
There is a forecast of sales receipts

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.220
in January, February and March.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.220
We see that we have a revenue

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.220
from the implementation.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.220
We expect to sell 250, 200 and 250

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.220
units of money per month.

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.220
Moreover, we lend

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.220
the vast majority of goods.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.220
We get 10% of the goods

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.220
instantly.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.220
You can see

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:28.220
how the ratio of the plan

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.220
of the implementation,

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.220
the plan of the sale and the plan of the implementation

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.220
is shown.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.220
The December implementation

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.220
of 350 units of money

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.220
is due in January.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.220
Only 25 units

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.220
and 10% of 250 units

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.220
we get in this period.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.220
Next, we have to plan

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.220
the plan of the payment

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.220
in accordance with the planned supplies.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.220
Supplies are calculated

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:11.220
for our revenue, for our volume of sales

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.220
in the amount of 80, 100 and 140

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.220
units of money.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.220
Supplies are carried out

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.220
with a payment deadline of a month.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.220
We pay for the supplies in December,

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.220
in January, in February,

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:33.220
in March.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.220
These inconsistencies of the payments,

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.220
the payments, the payments,

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:42.220
we planned in the long-term plan

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.220
in terms of the calculation of the turnover

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.220
capital, very largely.

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.220
Here, when we make a cash plan,

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:55.220
we plan in this way.

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.220
You can see the final cash plan

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.220
on this slide.

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:04.220
Here is the balance of money,

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.220
income and payments,

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.220
and the balance of income and payments

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.220
increases the balance of money

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.220
at the end of the period.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.220
We planned more or less successfully,

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:22.220
but if the cash plan shows a deficit

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:25.220
of money, then it is necessary

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:28.220
to provide short-term financing.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.220
This is due to additional interest payments.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.220
As an alternative, you can, again,

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:37.220
use the cash plan to put things in order

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.220
and provide some transfers

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.220
between the income and payments.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.220
That is, the cash plan allows us to predict

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.220
the short-term need for financing

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.220
and choose the optimal way to meet this need.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.220
If we have super-normal remains of money,

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.220
we must, within the framework of management

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.220
and optimization of these remains,

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.220
put the free remains, the excess remains,

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.220
the super-normal remains into liquid securities.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.220
Since we work in a very uncertain structure,

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:13.220
when we can always make some changes,

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.220
we have a function of planning,

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.220
a sign of planning,

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.220
and adaptability of planning.

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.220
That is, we must flexibly

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.220
foresee all these changes.

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.220
When we have planned some certain parameters,

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.220
indicators, we must always keep in mind

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.220
that there will be a need to review them.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.220
Flexibility of planning,

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.220
adaptability of planning

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.220
as an opportunity to make adjustments.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.220
For this, of course,

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.220
it is very convenient to use electronic tables.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.220
It is cheap, fast,

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.220
to review the entire planning process,

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.220
to put things in order,

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:04.220
to review the planned tasks,

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.220
to see what we get in the end,

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.220
and to make the plan optimal,

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.220
satisfying both owners and managers.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.220
Such a plan, the parameters of which

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.220
will not cause doubts

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:22.220
if the creditors need it.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:27.220
Financial Planning

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.220
Today we have covered the conceptual basis,

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.220
essence and features of financial planning.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.220
In the first section,

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.220
we have identified the target parameters of planning,

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.220
learned to divide long-term

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.220
strategy and tactics of the company.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.220
We have considered the processes of forecasting

01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.220
the money flows as a basis for ensuring

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.220
financial balance.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.220
This is a subject of current planning.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.220
We have considered the main methods of managing

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.220
profits to optimize tax payments.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.220
We have considered the methods of forecasting

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.220
the needs in investments,

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.220
sources of financing,

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.220
rules of financing,

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.220
risks of making decisions

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.220
about investments and financing.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.220
Then we have touched on short-term planning,

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.220
considered the technique of compiling

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.220
the cash plan,

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.220
the necessary and useful technique

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.220
that we can use every day.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.220
Thus, we have covered and, in general,

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.220
we have implemented the problem of financial planning

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.220
as a necessity of current and operational

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.220
monitoring of plans

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.220
to optimize the financial cycle.
