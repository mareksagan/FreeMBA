00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
So, friends, we have finished the first chapter,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.820
we have defined the main parameters of planning,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.020
and now we are moving directly to the planning process.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.420
First of all, we are engaged in forecasting the money flows.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.720
In general, planning of finances,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.620
strategic, operational, tactical,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.220
is the final stage of planning

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.220
of the entire business activity.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
In order to make a financial plan,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
we need the data of the marketing plan,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.220
production plan, organizational plans,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220
and all other types of business plans.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
But to follow the composition of these plans,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.220
usually in parallel,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
since it is necessary to ensure feedback,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.220
to take into account the production realities,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
and, on the contrary,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220
to make adjustments to the management plans

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
according to the parameters of the financial planning.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Financial planning is based on the concept of money flows.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.220
You remember this scheme,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.220
this is the basic scheme of German financial management.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.220
This scheme allows us to look at the enterprise

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
in a relationship with other enterprises.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
The scheme of money flows.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.220
Here we see how the enterprise is connected

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.220
with other enterprises in the markets of production,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.220
in the markets of purchases.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
We have a state, we have financial markets

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
from which the enterprise receives loans,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.220
and all this is aimed at one task,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
to ensure the continuity of money flows.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
We need to ensure liquidity.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
Therefore, in the planning phase,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.220
we first link commodity flows with financial flows

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.220
and provide for all the upcoming payment obligations

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.220
to be paid in due time

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
to suppliers, to creditors,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.220
to employees of the enterprise on the salary,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
of course, to the state.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.220
Thus, the task is to cover all possible deficits in due time

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.220
or, again, we do not forget that money should work,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.220
so we provide for the effective use of free financial resources,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.220
of surplus.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.220
The planning process involves a certain sequence,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.220
certain steps of planning.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.220
In general, they are universal and go in one scheme.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.220
First of all, we need to consider all commodity flows.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.220
What commodity flows we have from the markets of purchases,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220
what resources we buy,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220
how much, with what frequency,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.220
and, accordingly, we must determine how much financial funds

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220
will be needed for this in the financial planning.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
We must develop an investment plan,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.220
additional investments if we plan to expand activity

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.220
or, in general, investments if we create a new enterprise.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
In parallel with the investment plan,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.220
accordingly, we have an amortization calculation plan.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.220
Then we must calculate the cost of revenue

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.220
and calculate the cost for this revenue.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.220
In addition, when growing revenue,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.220
we must take into account that we will need

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
some additional investments,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
investments in reserves.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.220
This is the sphere of turnover calculations,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.220
pure turnover capital.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.220
After that, we can start

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.220
directly forming the main document of financial planning,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.220
the table of money flows.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220
Well, first we can conditionally call this table

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.220
the table of real commodity exchange.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.220
Here we apply only the positions

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.220
associated with the movement of goods,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.220
namely, revenue, cost,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.220
the purchase of necessary machines, equipment,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.220
the creation of stock of return funds.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.220
The result of this table shows us

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.220
the need for financing.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.220
This table is necessarily made up

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.220
for the entire horizon of planning

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.220
with a breakdown of planning steps.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
We are talking about a forecast document,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.220
a document that is made up for several years,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.220
at least 5 years, 3-5 years,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.220
and is broken down into smaller planning steps.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.220
In the simplest form, this is according to the years.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.220
Sometimes the features of planning,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.220
the features of the enterprise's activities

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.220
can imply quarterly planning.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.220
Even forecast planning

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.220
is a breakdown by quarters.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
We see that this table reflects all the flows

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.220
and outflows of funds that are necessary

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.220
for the maintenance of operational processes,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.220
real commodity exchange processes.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.220
Here is the sequence of components.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.220
Revenue from implementation,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.220
which comes to us from the marketing plan,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.220
how many goods, what price we produce,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.220
is reflected in the revenue,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.220
and the cost of the budget,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.220
the cost of the cost of the budget,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.220
is calculated.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.220
Next, we determine the need for investment.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.220
That is, the manufacturers calculate

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.220
the number of machines.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.220
We calculate the money we need

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
to purchase the main resources

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.220
and to create a supply of return funds.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
And finally, this table,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.220
when we put the funding sources,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220
provides liquidity.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.220
That is, the net cash flow is not negative.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.220
This is the parameter

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.220
that guarantees the profitability of our business

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.220
along with increasing profitability

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.220
and profitability,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.220
the growth of the business's cost.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.220
This kind of table is simplified,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.220
but it allows us to summarize

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.220
and show the interconnection

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.220
of all inflows and outflows of funds.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.220
In practice, they are more often

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.220
in a slightly different form.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.220
They divide the cash flows

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.220
in the sphere of their occurrence,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.220
highlighting operational,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.220
investment and financial activity.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.220
This is a detailed scheme of cash flows

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.220
in an electronic textbook.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.220
I ask you to carefully understand this scheme.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.220
It shows all accounting realities

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.220
and the correspondence of these flows

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
and the primary sources,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.220
what it means in accounting language

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220
and where the primary information

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.220
is located.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.220
This table shows the inflows and outflows

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.220
of funds and the financial result of the net cash flow.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.220
This is nothing more than a direct method

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.220
of forecasting cash flows.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.220
I think it is very convenient and clear.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.220
The main goal of this table

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.220
is not to miss any of the components

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.220
of the cash flows.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.220
In addition to the direct method

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.220
of forecasting cash flows,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.220
the broad spread received

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.220
a indirect method of forecasting cash flows.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.220
That is, when we deduce

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.220
our resulting indicator,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.220
the net cash flow,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.220
from the data of other financial documents.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.220
In a very simplified concept,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.220
the net cash flow is calculated

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.220
from the total net profit,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.220
depreciation deductions,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.220
as well as the change in debt,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.220
plus or minus the credit and debit debt.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.220
These quantities are calculated

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.220
at any enterprise

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.220
according to accounting or planned forms,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.220
form 1 and form 2.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.220
Most companies use the indirect method

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.220
because it is easy to use.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.220
If you look at the financial reports

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.220
of international companies,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.220
you will see that after the main positions

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.220
there is a turnover, a profit,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.220
and a cash flow.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.220
This is exactly what we get

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.220
in the process of financial planning.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.220
In addition, I want to remind you

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.220
that cash flows and horizon of planning

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.220
are a matter of time.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.220
The cash flows we receive

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.220
and pay out at different times

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.220
are not equal to us.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.220
The later we get the financial result,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220
the less interesting it is for us.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.220
I remind you about discounting,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.220
about how to provide data compatibility.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.220
If we want to calculate the financial result

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.220
by the growing result,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.220
by summing up the net cash flow by years,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.220
we do not have the right to do this directly

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.220
by adding up the net cash flow

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.220
of the first period of 100 units,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.220
adding up the net cash flow

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.220
of the second period of 100 units,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.220
these units are not equal to each other.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.220
Before adding them up,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.220
we need to discount them.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.220
In total, the discounted amount of the cash flow

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.220
is equal to the total discounted value

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.220
of the current value

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.220
that summarizes the financial result

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.220
of the activity during all periods of planning.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.220
This indicator is usually necessary

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.220
for the new enterprise.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.220
We are now starting to calculate

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.220
the investment needs.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.220
We should remember that this is

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.220
the investment in the property,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.220
in the assets of the enterprise.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.220
Investments are used in the capital,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.220
the connection of capital in production,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.220
the acquisition of property.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.220
On the diagram you can see

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.220
the investment classification

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.220
and the division of investments

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.220
into real and financial investments.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.220
Real investments are strategic decisions

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.220
that determine in the forecast plan

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.220
what capital is needed

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220
to purchase buildings,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.220
structures, machines and equipment,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.220
and what capital is needed

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.220
to create or increase stocks.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.220
Financial investments are planned

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.220
as long-term investments

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.220
in other enterprises,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.220
acquisitions of shares of another enterprise.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.220
Or we can plan short-term investments

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.220
in short-term financial securities.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.220
We plan short-term investments,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:30.220
that is, the acquisition of short-term financial securities.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.220
Accordingly, in the balance sheet, they are reflected as short-term financial investments in the second section of the balance sheet.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.220
The calculation of investment needs

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.220
includes the assessment of the necessary

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220
capital, the total cost of the necessary

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.220
equipment, machines, structures,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.220
vehicles and other assets.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.220
These calculations are calculated

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.220
in the production plan

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.220
as part of the justification

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.220
of production capacity.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.220
They are connected with the established

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.220
strategy of the enterprise

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220
and are used in the final form.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.220
The only thing we pay attention to

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.220
is the correct planning

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.220
and calculation of amortization calculations.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.220
The next component of investment

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.220
is the turnover capital.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.220
It is the most important part

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.220
of the strategic financial planning.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.220
The turnover capital

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.220
is the most important part

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.220
of the strategic financial planning.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.220
Why do we need it?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220
It is a barrier

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.220
between the perception of this concept

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.220
and the mixing of the turnover capital

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.220
with the current activity,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.220
with direct acquisition

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.220
and with the writing of raw materials.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.220
The turnover capital

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.220
should be minimally necessary

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.220
but sufficient.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.220
If we create unnecessary reserves,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.220
it will affect the efficiency

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.220
of our activities.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.220
A shortage of reserves

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.220
can lead to breakdowns.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.220
The turnover capital

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.220
should be minimally necessary

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.220
but sufficient.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.220
The situation of the turnover capital

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.220
is the absence of stock in the warehouse,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.220
the absence of a position in the trading room,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.220
the absence of fresh bread every day

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.220
or the absence of money for payment from the accounts.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.220
The importance of the turnover capital

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.220
should be remembered

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.220
because it is the main factor

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.220
that determines the value of the project.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.220
The turnover capital increases

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.220
when the enterprise develops.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.220
The reserves of the enterprise increase

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.220
and certain funds are needed.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.220
It should be remembered

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.220
that the turnover capital

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.220
can exceed the main capital

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.220
if the enterprise develops.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.220
The calculation of the turnover capital

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.220
follows the plan of revenue

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.220
and the cost-benefit ratio.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.220
We use the existing data

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.220
such as the revenue,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.220
the cost of the finished product

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.220
and the cost of the material costs.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.220
These are the main parameters

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.220
that we take from the strategic plan.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.220
We take the annual cost from the meta

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.220
and remember that we have 360 days per year.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.220
According to these data,

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.220
we proceed to the planning of the turnover capital,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.220
sequentially moving from each position

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.220
of the current assets.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.220
We start planning the reserves

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.220
The quantity of the material and the resources

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.220
depends on the supply interval.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.220
For example,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.220
if we receive materials every 10 days,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.220
it means that we have to form reserves

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.220
for these 10 days.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.220
Therefore, we take the material costs

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.220
from the cost of the finished product

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.220
and the cost of the finished product

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.220
and the cost of the material resources

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.220
and the cost of the material resources.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.220
In other words,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.220
the turnover capital

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.220
will work in the resources of the resources.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.220
The next component is the unfinished product.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.220
This is a component

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.220
that is only for production companies.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.220
For commercial companies,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.220
this is a component

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.220
that is only for production companies.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.220
depends on the production cycle.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.220
For example,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.220
we have 15 days.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.220
I will insert specific numbers

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.220
so that it is more clear.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.220
depends on the material costs

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.220
The cost of the unfinished product

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.220
depends on the material costs

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.220
and the cost of the finished product.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.220
The next component of the turnover assets

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.220
is the debitor's debt,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.220
which is formed due to the fact

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.220
that we provide a delay to our buyers.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.220
Accordingly,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.220
we do not receive some part of the revenue

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.220
as much as we give a delay.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.220
As much as we give a delay.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.220
For example, 30 days.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.220
Next, we can plan

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.220
the minimum necessary remainder

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.220
of the finished product in the warehouse.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.220
of the finished product in the warehouse.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.220
For example,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.220
we have a store for 3 days.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.220
This also means

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.220
that we do not sell it immediately

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.220
and, accordingly, do not receive the revenue.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.220
All these intervals of time

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.220
are interconnected.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.220
We put here nothing but points

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.220
that make up segments of the financial cycle.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.220
All these standards work

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.220
and determine the amount of turnover capital.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.220
The more these management standards,

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.220
the more turnover capital.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.220
If we sum up the resulting component,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.220
the calculated component,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220
we get the total amount

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.220
of turnover capital

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.220
produced in the warehouse.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.220
The turnover capital is the capital

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.220
that must be invested in our stocks.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.220
the turnover capital is the capital

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.220
that must be invested in our stocks.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.220
But, of course, you immediately thought

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.220
that in addition to the fact

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.220
that we provide a delay,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.220
we are also provided with a delay.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.220
We have a credit debt

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.220
and we will pay for it 45 days later.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.220
We have a credit debt

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.220
and we will pay for it 45 days later.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.220
And for financial planning,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.220
we are interested in the amount

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.220
of net working capital.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.220
of net working capital.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.220
This is the amount

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.220
that shows us

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.220
the amount of money

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.220
that is needed for investment

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.220
together with the main capital.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.220
together with the main capital.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.220
The less the net turnover capital,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.220
the shorter the financial cycle of the enterprise.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.220
The less the net turnover capital,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.220
the shorter the financial cycle of the enterprise.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.220
The financial cycle is a normative one.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.220
It is an operational cycle

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.220
and after 45 days

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.220
we have a 13-day financial cycle.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.220
The shorter the financial cycle,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.220
the faster the turnover,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.220
the more significant the financial results.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.220
In addition to this scrupulous method

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.220
of calculating the turnover capital

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.220
by all components,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.220
we can calculate the turnover capital

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.220
by the turnover capital that has been formed.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.220
We can calculate the turnover capital

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.220
by the turnover capital that has been formed.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.220
In addition to this,

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.220
there is another method

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.220
of calculating the turnover capital

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.220
that is calculated at $100 per turnover.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.220
If we have this normative,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.220
we can multiply any planned annual turnover

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.220
by this normative

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.220
by adjusting the number of days in the period

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.220
and calculate the value of our turnover capital.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.220
This is a similar calculation,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.220
but here we determine

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.220
the separate costs

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.220
and the separate costs

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.220
for $100 of revenue.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.220
According to the accounting,

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.220
it is easy to calculate the costs of raw materials,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.220
amortization, and other expenses.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.220
And we can set the same standards

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.220
for storing raw materials in the warehouse,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.220
the time of production,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.220
the storage of products in the warehouse,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.220
and get the total cost of stocks

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.220
and the normative of the turnover capital

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.220
for $100 of revenue.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.220
You can use any method.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.220
The point is not to forget

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.220
to take into account the need for turnover capital.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.220
This is the main problem.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.220
Why does the enterprise have no money?

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.220
This is the first problem that arises.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.220
It shows that all components are not taken into account.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.220
All components are taken into account incorrectly.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.220
The components are not thought out,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.220
or the normative was taken into account during planning,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.220
but in reality, the situation has changed

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.220
and no operational measures have been taken.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.220
I want to emphasize the importance

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.220
of calculating turnover capital.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.220
I want to emphasize that turnover capital is very mobile and variable.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.220
It is the first component that reacts to any changes

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.220
in the market or within the company.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.220
The need to calculate turnover capital

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.220
and monitor business activity

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.220
should be the basis of the work of financial services.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.220
should be the basis of the work of financial services.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.220
To monitor, it is necessary to regularly

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.220
monitor the balance of turnover funds,

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.220
monitor the warning options

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.220
and break-downs in any position.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.220
There may be problems with the suppliers,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.220
or something is not in order in production.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.220
or something is not in order in production.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.220
Or the finished product is stored in the warehouse,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.220
so it is necessary to put the marketing in order.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.220
I would like to draw your attention to the financial indicators.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.220
I would like to draw your attention to the financial indicators.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.220
These are external indicators

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.220
that easily react and show the situation

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.220
at our company.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.220
They are followed by a system of organization

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.220
of production processes,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.220
ensuring the production of products.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.220
But, of course,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.220
the head of the warehouse does not understand

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.220
what the cost of stock is.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.220
But he understands well

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.220
that the delivery interval is 10 days.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.220
Therefore, this parameter should be voiced.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.220
Unfinished production is a financial

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.220
and economic parameter for the organizers

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.220
of production.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.220
It is not clear, but 15 days

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.220
is the norm for which the head of the warehouse

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.220
or the head of the warehouse

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.220
or the head of the warehouse

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.220
is responsible for the production.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.220
This is a purely financial parameter

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.220
and requires a lot of work,

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.220
meticulous work, regular work

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.220
with suppliers and customers.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.220
This includes monitoring the reliability

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.220
of customers, the reliability of suppliers,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.220
the payment ability of customers,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.220
whether the supplier can withstand

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.220
the regularity of the delivery.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.220
And you want to provide the supplier

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.220
with goods with a payment delay.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.220
The more you provide the suppliers

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.220
with the editor's post,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.220
the longer the delay period

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.220
is, the more the cost of delivery

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.220
is.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.220
The more the cost of delivery

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.220
is, the longer the delay period

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.220
is, the longer the cost of delivery

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.220
is.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.220
The turnover is an indicator of business

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.220
activity. If business activity increases,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.220
the turnover is released.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.220
If there is a slowdown in the process,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.220
a new infusion is required

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220
in any of these components.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.220
So, we have determined how much money

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.220
will be needed to purchase equipment,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.220
how much will be needed to create

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.220
or increase the stock of turnover

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.220
for the accepted program.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.220
Now we must determine the sources

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.220
of funding.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.220
Please see the slide

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.220
with the information about the source

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.220
of funding.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.220
Please see the slide with the information

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.220
about the source

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.220
of funding.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.220
Please see the slide with the information

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.220
about the source

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.220
about the source

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:42.220
about the source

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.220
about the source

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.220
about the source

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.220
about the source

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.220
about the source

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.220
about the source

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.220
about the source

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.220
about the source

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.220
about the source

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.220
about the source

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.220
about the source

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.220
about the source

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.220
about the source

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.220
about the source

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.220
about the source

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.220
about the source

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:33.220
It is important to separate the source of capital from the external and internal sources of capital.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.220
External sources are those that come to our enterprise from outside,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:46.220
and internal sources are those that are formed during the enterprise's activities.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.220
Here is an interesting example.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.220
The accumulated profit is the component of the capital itself,

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:02.220
the so-called self-financing, the internal source of financing.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:08.220
An interesting position is the debt on taxes and fees, the internal source of financing.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.220
The effect of financing here is that these obligations are fulfilled with a certain delay.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.220
The payments of the current period are reduced.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.220
For example, the special value is the pension fund.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:26.220
This is the component of the cost of this period.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.220
It reduces the taxable profit of this period,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.220
and is reimbursed within the next 15 days.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.220
That is, within 15 days, we have some amount of funds

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.220
that will serve as a source of financing.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.220
In this case, it is short-term financing.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:56.220
A specific source of financing is the financing of the re-laying and changing of the asset structure.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.220
We are talking about amortization.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.220
As you know, amortization payments are intended to reimburse the cost of the worn-out equipment

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.220
after a certain period, after 10 years.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.220
But today, this money, together with others,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.220
can be used to finance some current needs.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:23.220
Or even to finance the development, to buy new machines, equipment,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:29.220
production areas, trading areas, without waiting for the wear of the old ones.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.220
At the moment, this allows you to increase your revenue

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:39.220
and in 10 years, to earn money for replacing the worn-out equipment.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.220
These components, the internal sources of financing,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.220
are the highest qualifications of financial management.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:55.220
Financial managers are forced to work every single penny.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.220
Amortization is used to finance the reserve payments.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.220
Debit debt is sold.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:08.220
This is the position of the factoring of the sources of financing.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:15.220
The division of the sources of financing into long-term and short-term is understandable.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.220
For example, the long-term source of financing is, of course, the capital itself.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.220
But the capital is divided into both long-term and short-term.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.220
The long-term source of financing is, of course, the long-term loans.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:39.220
The short-term source of financing is the debt of the creditor.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.220
Short-term financing is the most frequently discussed,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.220
more lively topic.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.220
In order to resort to short-term financing,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.220
you need to take into account the existing realities,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.220
the possibility of obtaining short-term loans, their price.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.220
In addition, there are formal requirements for bank institutions

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.220
for liquidity and turnover indicators.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.220
These conditions for providing short-term loans can change

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.220
depending on the liquidity indicators.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.220
The creditor considers liquidity indicators,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.220
identifies less or more risky borrowers,

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:27.220
and increases the loan rate depending on this analysis.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:36.220
The Russian reality today is a strict control of the amount of clean assets in the borrower's balance.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:51.220
Financial support for creditors is a very interesting and profitable article in financing.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.220
It is free financing.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.220
Here, of course, it is necessary to clearly control the payment deadlines

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.220
of the creditors and debitors.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:09.220
In order to ensure the level of the contract,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.220
we provided favorable conditions for us.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:20.220
For example, we did it in the account of the turnover capital.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.220
There were 45 days and 30 days,

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.220
which gave us 15 days of opportunity, 15 days of advantage.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.220
What else should be taken into account when we solve the issue of financing?

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.220
An important component for a financial manager

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.220
is the ability to save on tax payments.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.220
In particular, simple mechanisms.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.220
It should be remembered that interest on loans is included in the cost.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.220
However, in our realities, this is limited to the limit of the refinancing rate of 10%.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.220
This will reduce the taxable profit.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.220
You can save on tax payments by accelerating amortization.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:08.220
In general, accelerated amortization is a powerful tool for saving on taxes around the world.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.220
It acquires slightly different forms.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.220
Because a limited number of enterprises

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.220
has the opportunity to save by using accelerated amortization.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.220
In particular, leasing.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:26.220
Leasing is one of the most interesting and best laws.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:33.220
It provides that leasing payments can be increased by three times.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:39.220
In general, leasing is a powerful tool.

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:44.220
In addition to using leasing, we save on one-time costs,

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.220
on the purchase of leasing items, on the purchase of equipment.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.220
From a financial point of view, it is very important to save on taxes.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.220
Leasing payments in full, with accelerated amortization,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.220
with interest on loans, with insurance contributions,

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.220
are included in the cost.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.220
Thus, the taxable profit is reduced.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:15.220
These are the civilized ways to save on tax payments

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:20.220
within the framework of the existing laws.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:25.220
When we talk about determining the source of financing,

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:31.220
we must remember the well-known rules and principles of financing.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.220
Let's look at the principles of financing.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.220
The first one is the principle of economic value.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.220
What does it mean?

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.220
The price at which we spend our financing.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.220
The average cost of capital.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:53.220
That is, we must attract the funds that we need for financing

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.220
with minimum costs.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.220
And if we have free excess funds,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.220
we must use them in a profitable way,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.220
by investing in securities.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.220
The principle of purposeful use of funds

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.220
is associated with the so-called golden rule of financing.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.220
That is, long-term funds should be used

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.220
to purchase machines, equipment,

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.220
long-term property.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.220
And short-term sources of financing are used

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220
to finance current needs,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.220
to cover cash outages.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.220
This is a clear rule.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.220
It is actually violated at every step.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.220
And what happens?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.220
Let's take a short-term loan

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:54.220
and buy a machine, equipment.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.220
The source of repayment of loans is always

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.220
profit and depreciation.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.220
Profit is an indicator that may not exist.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.220
Depreciation is 10% per year.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.220
Compare 10% and the interest rate for a short-term loan.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.220
Let's recall the golden rule of financing.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.220
Why is it so important?

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.220
If we use short-term loans with a rate of 20%

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.220
to purchase the main funds,

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.220
which have a 10% depreciation,

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.220
and there is a little profit,

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.220
we are pre-claiming ourselves

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.220
to be unpayable.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.220
For the next turn,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.220
for the next snowball,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.220
we need new loans.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.220
New loans, new loans,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.220
new money.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.220
The next principle of financing is

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.220
the independence of financing.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.220
Of course, when we use loans,

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.220
we must somehow protect ourselves,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.220
minimize our risk.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.220
We also have a 50-50 rule.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.220
We measure the volume of the loan

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.220
with our own funds.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.220
Limiting the size of the business

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.220
to the size of our wallet,

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.220
as the Americans say.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.220
Let me remind you again

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.220
that the security of financing

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.220
is related to ensuring financial stability.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.220
We talked about this

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.220
and said that it is a cornerstone

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.220
of financial balance.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.220
In connection with the price of financing,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.220
the price of capital,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.220
with balancing on the verge of risk and profitability,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.220
we can give an example.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.220
Let's say the expected return on shares

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.220
of the company is 14%,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.220
and the obligation is less than 9%.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.220
What does this mean in terms of risk?

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.220
A higher return on shares

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.220
means that they are more risky

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.220
if I want to purchase shares of this company.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.220
In order to protect myself,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.220
I am not inclined to risk,

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.220
I will purchase bonds.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.220
On the management side,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.220
on the contrary,

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.220
my own financing is considered less risky,

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.220
and therefore the managers are ready

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.000
to pay a higher price for capital shares.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:30.000
The need for financing, we return to the sphere of our planning, directly to the planning processes,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
shows a table of money flows.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:41.000
This is negative net cash flow per saldo of investment and operational activities,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
so to speak, negative saldo of the real sphere.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000
In order to cover these deficits and use certain sources of financing,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
it is necessary to take into account certain components.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Please look at the slide, they are listed.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
First, the presence and size of your own capital,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
how much of your own money we can invest in the creation of an enterprise or its development.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
On the other hand, the availability of credit financing,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
is there an opportunity to get loans.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000
The conditions for lending arise, how much does it cost,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
what kind of insurance is required for a loan,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
do we have such an insurance.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
The target parameter is the maximization of income for the shareholder on capital,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
that is, the financial manager calculates the profitability of his own capital,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
the action of the financial lever.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Financial investors are always interested in the moment of leaving the business,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
how easy it is to leave the business,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
at what stage can this company be sold,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
at what stage of development this company,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
for what price, will there be buyers.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
It is always very interesting to provide flexibility in financing.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
In any case, if we plan our sources of financing,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
taking into account all these realities,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
we must provide some kind of reserve,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
if something goes wrong, as we planned,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
it will be possible to change something.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
For this, of course, money is needed.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
The next rule is that banks are the institutions where you will be given money

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
when you do not need it.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Banks are willing to lend to companies that have enough money.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:51.000
All these financing solutions form the target structure and the average capital price.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
The contract planning of the table of money flows

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
is a very convenient tool for modeling sources of financing.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Here we see three standard options.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Payment of a single amount at the end of the lending period,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
payment of equal amounts every year for 250 units,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
and the third option is an annuity of payments with equal contributions.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
For us, these orders and financing schedules are not indifferent.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
We need to choose the one that is convenient for us.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Convenient from the point of view of money flows.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
We refer to our table of money flows and look at how,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
depending on how we expect the proceeds to come to us,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
how we will pay,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
what money flows we will generate in order to pay off the loan.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And accordingly, we choose any of these options,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
the loan repayment schedule,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
we agree with the lender and conclude our special schedule,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
including, for example, the interest rate,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
not from the first period, but after several periods.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
This is especially important for large projects,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
for investment projects, for projects in the creation of enterprises.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
How can an enterprise that has been created today,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
which will be built in 2-5 years,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
start to pay off a loan today?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
This is unrealistic.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Therefore, all these are possible options,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
flexibility in financing and financing realities,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
what we have, what opportunities we have today in the financial market.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
In general, academically, and in life, this rule is very important,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
whether to take a loan or not.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
This strategic decision that top managers make

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
is related to the actions of the financial lever.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
I have already mentioned this several times.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
You know that the financial lever describes the profitability of its own capital.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
It is associated with the model of profitability of its own capital,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
which shows the dependence of the profitability of its own capital

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
on the profitability of assets and financial stability.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Please see, here we have nothing but the coefficient of financial autonomy.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And the financial lever, which talks about the possibilities of financing,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
about the risks of financing, is involved in this model of profitability.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
The goal of lending, the goal of activity in general,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
is to increase the profitability of shareholders,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
to increase the return on shareholder capital.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
It can be achieved by a risky action,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
risky from the point of view of financial stability,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
by the decision to take an additional loan.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And this decision will be justified if our interest rate on the loan

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
exceeds the already achieved profitability of assets.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
In this case, financial stability changes,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
the share of its own capital is reduced,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
the simplest setting, the simplest numbers can be seen.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
And then we get the growth of the profitability of our own capital.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I will ask you to see the examples in the conspect, in the workbook,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
to see the examples of calculations and modeling of loan calculations,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
and to remember the actions of the financial lever,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
the actions of the profitability model.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
I ask you to analyze these tasks

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
and try to apply them to your reality,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
to the activities of your companies,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
and use them in your practice.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Our main goal is to help solve problems in business.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
We analyze very popularly, very simply.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I try to give you such basics of financial planning,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
because we have programs, complexes for financial planning, automation.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Of course, no one does anything by hand,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
but in order to use all these tools correctly,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
you need to understand what you want,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
what are the final strategic parameters we want to get.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
We always remember profitability and risk,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
about two components.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Please, our profitability and risk of financial stability.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
A little tour back to the topic that you have already passed in financial management,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
the financial lever.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Thus, we use all the principles of financing,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
all the rules of financing,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
plus the availability of financial tools.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
We have our reality,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
whether we can or want to give us loans.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
We choose a convenient financing scheme

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
suitable for our company from the point of view of expected inflows and outflows of funds.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
What do we want to get from this financing?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
We have achieved the strategic goal.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
These issues are solved in the process of routine planning.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
We choose a convenient, I emphasize, scheme of financing,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
not an optimal one.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
We leave the concept of optimal financing to the theorists.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
However, if you want to receive the Nobel Prize,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
this is exactly the area where I wish you success.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Financial flow

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Now, after we have planned the money flows,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
we move on to other documents of the financial plan.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
You have already been asked in Paravia about money flows,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
cash flow, and what's next.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Money flows are the basis of financial planning,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
but in addition to the fact that we make up the money flows,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
we also make up the plan balances and the profit plan.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
These documents are necessary in order to transfer information,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
to exchange information from one form to another.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
It is impossible to make up a plan of money flows without a profit plan.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
In addition, then, according to the entire set of financial documents,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
we can calculate the financial coefficients

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
corresponding to our strategic goals,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
analyze the parameters of profitability and risk

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
according to the planned and predicted data,

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
and, if necessary, make changes,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
review the planned task,

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
and then we can extend all our stages of planning,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
solutions for all stages of planning,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
according to the set strategic parameters,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
according to the tactically established standards.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
So, we are planning the company balance.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
The balance plan is also a table,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
a strategic plan, a forecast balance,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
which is also a table, different from the accounting form of the balance,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
that is, the positions in the balance are all the same,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
but the balances are also made up for the entire horizon of planning,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
by year, as a rule, by the end of the year,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:48.000
every planned year, we set out what positions we will have in the balance,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
and we will make decisions about investments and financing.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So, in this forecast balance, we will have information

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
about where the funds came from,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
the sources of financing, passives,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
how they were used,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
look at the slide, the balance scheme,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
the asset on the left, the passive on the right,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000
and in the process of planning, it will be more convenient for us to use the passive for the asset.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
So, you see, the logical scheme, what is the balance,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
in passives, the sources of financing,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
in assets, how they were used, investments,

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
the passive shows what funds are invested,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
what capital is invested,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
the asset shows what property the enterprise has,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
what other obligations should be in passives,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
what is credited to the owners in passives,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
their own capital,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.000
we see that we have two components of one whole,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
financing and investment.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
We see that these are two components of one whole,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
financing and investment.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
There is no investment without financing,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
and financing without investment.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Here is our balance,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000
and two sides are equal in balance,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
with equal balance,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
with equal amount in the end.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
The asset structure,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
how do we get the asset structure in the balance,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
we transfer all our strategic investment decisions here.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
If we buy equipment,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
we get the main funds in the balance.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
If we use leasing,

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
we use leasing,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
accordingly, our investments are not reflected.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Leasing is already a current aspect of activity,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
payments on leasing are reflected in the profit plan,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
in the cost, in the second form of accounting.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
That is, the assets in the balance are connected with the investment plan,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
and with the section of investment activity,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
the table of money flows.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000
The balance assets are built in accordance with the decisions made on financing.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
What funds do we use?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Our own capital,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
in the form of initial investments,

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
in the form of fixed capital,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
in the form of accumulated profits in the process of activity,

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
or in the form of borrowed capital,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
which we use.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
As the enterprise develops,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
in addition to external sources,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000
internal sources are reflected in the enterprise balance,

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
for example, accumulated profits,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
the capital itself increases.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
If the enterprise works with losses,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
the capital itself is exhausted.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
This is an extremely unfavorable situation.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
We can use such a balance to calculate financial coefficients.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
But not quite in this form,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
it is better to use a converted balance.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Financial coefficients are assumed to be a conversion of the balance.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
How?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.000
From the passives, the credit debt is transferred to the assets with a minus sign.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
As if we said that the credit debt covers our need for turnover capital.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
And the turnover assets with the deduction of the credit debt

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
form a pure turnover capital of the enterprise.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
And it is in this form,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
as you have on the slide,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
an analytical balance,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
it shows exactly this balance,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
what funds the enterprise has invested in assets,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
what capital was used,

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
and what property the enterprise has.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Here is the balance.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Where and how is the balance presented?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And, of course, you already know the financing rules.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
We can control the balance

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
by comparing the capital itself with non-turnover assets.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
The gold financing rule.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Capital itself with borrowed capital.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Horizontally and vertically.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Capital itself with borrowed capital.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
We check the financial stability.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
The profit plan.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
The most important document.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
The profitability of the enterprise was and remains

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
the most important parameter of the efficiency of the enterprise.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
The profit plan includes both the income and the expense positions.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
It reflects the current results of the enterprise.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
The profit plan is usually made

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
when the enterprise is created only after the start of the production process.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
This reflects the income,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
the income from other types of activities,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
and the corresponding current costs, costs, expenses.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
In order to make up the profit plan,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
we use production plans,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
marketing plans,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
and the corresponding budgetary costs.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
We do not consider the budgetary technique within our course.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
It is a separate subject, a separate course.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
But, of course, there is no financial planning without budgets.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
I will ask you to look at the table in detail

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
how the income and expenses of the enterprise are formed.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
It is an expanded table that I have compiled for you in the textbook.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Another interesting point that can be touched upon is our modernity.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000
How do we plan the revenue?

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
How do we plan the revenue?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
How do we predict the revenue?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:04.000
First of all, the growth of the revenue is one of the most important goals of many companies.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
A company can set an annual revenue growth of 10%, for example,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
or set a goal to achieve a certain revenue in 3 years, 5 years, or more.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
To predict the revenue,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
you can use a very interesting model of achievable growth.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
It is shown on the slide.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
The model is quite complex.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
You can understand how it works by analyzing the example,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
which is provided in the textbook.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
This model is derived.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
You can trust this model.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
It shows how to develop,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000
how to achieve revenue with certain parameters.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Moreover, you can use any target parameters in this model,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
such as a certain profitability,

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
the turnover of assets,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
or a target capital structure in relation to your own and borrowed funds.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
The model is very interesting.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Calculations are not difficult.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.000
You can use the electronic tables to see the calculations.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
The model is used.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
The revenue is calculated.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
If the planned revenue calculated by this model is not enough,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
does not meet our desires, ambitions, and the accepted strategy,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
we must correct the bias,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000
sacrifice, for example, financial stability,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
and increase the share of borrowed capital.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
The plan of revenue is a tax instrument.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
We determine what taxes we will pay.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
The payment of taxes goes from the plan of revenue to the plan of cash flows,

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
as the position of the flow of payment.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:19.000
The plan of revenue involves a certain optimization of tax payments.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Financial managers, taking advantage of the accounting policy,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
adopt a certain accounting policy,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
which is profitable and purposeful at the moment,

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:37.000
use a rich arsenal of revenue maneuvering.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
I recommend you to read the books and chapters of Professor Kovalyov

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
on the issue of revenue management.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.000
It is a very interesting topic of research.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:03.000
The qualification of a financial manager is related to the possibility of tax payments optimization.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
We have already mentioned this.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
This includes accelerated monetization, revaluation of the main funds,

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.000
the use of leasing, the use of certain accounting methods,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000
interest rates for credit writing costs, and so on.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
It is very interesting and very useful.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Of course, we all do not like to pay taxes,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000
but we must, because we carry out our activities under the protection of the state,

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000
and the state receives its share of our income from us for this.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Another interesting point that we must take into account,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
and I want to draw your attention to, in the framework of the PLAN,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
is, of course, the calculation of cost.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Budgeting, budget technology is a separate topic,

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
but we must take into account the following essential things.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000
We must remember that we have variable and conditional costs in our expenses.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000
As soon as we forget about this, we will have distortions,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
we will have troubles, we will have a bad planning.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Why?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
It is not easy to divide variable and conditional costs by their accounting.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
If I ask a student, they will tell me right away,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
good students, that variable costs are the main salary,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
the main material is the paid salary,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and the conditional costs are rent, amortization.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yes, it is true.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
There are some articles on the current costs that can be attributed to variable and conditional costs,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
but we still use the word conditional and conditional more often.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And just to scrupulously divide these costs,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
this is variable, this is conditional,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
in principle, this is not the main goal.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
We need to remember the trends.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
We need to understand that the higher the constant costs,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
the greater the risk of being in excess.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
We remember the actions of the operating lever,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
so we must clearly measure our ambitions,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
for example, to rent an office in the center of Moscow with the appropriate rent,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and for this we must provide the appropriate turnover,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
consulting and the appropriate volume of services provided.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
If we forget about constant costs,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
if we do not clarify in the planning process,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and even more precisely, if we do not make an element of the analysis of profitability

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
at the end of the plan,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and such a line as the determination of the profitable volume of sales

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and the reserve of financial strength as an assessment of the risk,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
we can get into a bad situation,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
be in losses when our revenue,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
our marginal income,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
the revenue will not cover the costs,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
and even if the revenue covers the costs,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
then, perhaps, the marginal income will not cover our variable costs.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Again, I remind you of the two components, profitability and risk.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Very roughly and in a large way,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
in the planning, of course, in terms of the profit in terms of the lines,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
when we have a cost, including constant variable costs,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000
we provide variable costs that change proportionally in terms of revenue.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
These variable costs must be justified,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
they must have the appropriate standards,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and these standards can be introduced according to the accounting.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
The scrupulous planning offers a scrupulous calculation of all the components of variable costs

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and the standards of variable costs for the specific indicator,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
for the ruble, for the piece, for the ton.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The universal meter is, of course, the variable costs in the calculation for the ruble of revenue.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Current costs are constant variable,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
this is a fundamental point.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
In addition, there is a very common case

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
when the current costs and capital costs are mixed.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
We are talking about the core moments of profit planning.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Profit is the second part of the balance sheet,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the second form of accounting,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
it is associated with the current results of activities.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Only the current costs are reflected in the corresponding costs.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
All capital costs, all uniform costs,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
they affect the positions of the balance sheet.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
What example can be given of a mixture?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
A new company is created,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and before the start of the operating processes,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
at the moment of the creation of the enterprise,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
registration of the enterprise,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
there are expenses that seem to be current expenses,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
the salary of the accountant.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
But in fact, these expenses before the start of the production process

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
cannot be written off for revenue,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
so they are the position of the balance sheet.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Such expenses that seem to be current,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
in fact, are capital,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
they must be carried out by the corresponding accounting procedures

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and reflected in the balance sheet as expenses for the future,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
as organizational expenses.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Otherwise, it turns out that there is no revenue,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
there are current expenses,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
which means that losses are formed in the enterprise,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
these losses increase,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
they then go into the balance sheet of the enterprise,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
they exhaust their own capital,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
the net assets of the enterprise are negative,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
and with such a balance sheet,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
you do not have to count on a loan.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I would like to draw your attention to the division of the concepts

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
of the results and expenses,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
inflows and outflows of funds.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Today we have touched on these concepts in one way or another.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And once again,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
we summarize the results and expenses in terms of profit,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
inflows and outflows in cash flows.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
There is no coarser mistake in economic judgments,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
as the academician Novozhilov once said,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
than in the mixture of income and expense,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
with the result and expenses.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This also happens.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But we have already given examples many times.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Why does the difference between the concept of profit and cash flow arise?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Because we have the results of activity,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
for example, revenue,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
which is not always an inflow of funds

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
to the force of the formation of the debtor's debt.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
As part of the expenses,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
we have a wonderful article

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
called amortization calculations,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
which does not mean outflows.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It is not paid out in the current period.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Amortization calculations accumulate

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and affect the financial result.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So, we have considered,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
touched on the basics of planning cash flows,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
liquidity tables, cash flow,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
planned balances,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
profit plans.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
All these tables are interconnected.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
They are made in parallel,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and a separate position goes from one document

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
to another document,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
and is corrected.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
For example, we determine the possibility of a loan

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
by the flow of money.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Finances of loans

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
affect the position of the balance.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
In the profit plan,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
after determining the order of financing,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
we correct the cost for interest payments.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And, in turn,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
calculating the tax on the profit,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
we use a new position,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and transfer this position to the cash flow plan.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Only after making a profit

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
in the cash flow plan

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
we get a table of tax payments.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Here is a simple example.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
This is a professor Zelia,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
my teacher.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
This is a professor of the University of Bremen.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
A simple example of the creation of an enterprise.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
We can see the relationship

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
between finance and accounting.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Let's say,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
in the first year we created an enterprise

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and invested our own capital.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Here we see the investment of our own capital

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
in the balance.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
We have this money on the account,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
in the assets, in the passives,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
as a fixed capital.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And it is reflected as a flow of funds

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
in terms of liquidity.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
The net cash flow is plus 40.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
In the next year,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
in the next period,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
we buy machines and equipment

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
for the money we have

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and create a reserve of return funds.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
You can see the change in the balance position

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
and the change in the position of the inflows and outflows.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
In terms of liquidity,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
negative saldo is formed,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
negative net cash flow,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
which means a decrease in the money

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
on the account.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Look, 0 was 40,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
net cash flow minus 40,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it became 0.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
We have specially stretched it a little

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
for clarity.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Yes, usually these processes are parallel,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
especially when we talk about an operating enterprise.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It is just more convenient to look at these points

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
to create an enterprise.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And finally, in the third period,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
we start the process of manufacturing goods,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
selling goods,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
and, accordingly,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
the positions of the profit plan appear.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Profit is formed,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
tax is formed,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
inflows and outflows of funds are changed.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I would like to draw your attention to the outflows of funds.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
We reflect the cost of the amortization payments.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
In the profit plan,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
we have the total cost of 53 units.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
In the balance,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
we also have new positions,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
the profit tax of this period.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Here, while reflected as a budget calculation,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
the profit tax will be paid in the next period.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And the next year,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
we continue the production process,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
taxes are paid,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
revenue from the implementation as an outflow of funds is received.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
We pay for our current use of resources.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And since we planned everything well,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
everything is correct,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
we are constantly increasing the currency balance.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
We are getting richer.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Thus, we have considered all the processes and documents

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
of long-term financial planning.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
How to make a profit plan,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
how to make a profit plan,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
how to make balances.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
According to these documents,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
the leaders of the upper and middle links

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
can assess

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
how the company will generate a pure money flow,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what needs will appear in investments

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and external financing,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and when it will appear,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
at what time.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Then we will be able to assess the possibility

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and terms of payment of interest,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
repayment of debt.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
We can monitor the change in the balance value of property

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
according to the predicted balance,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
how the structure of capital will change.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
We will definitely take measures

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
to optimize tax payments,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
we will plan the payment of dividends.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And in the end,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
we will predict and calculate the financial state,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
assess profitability and risk of activity

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
in standard indicators.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
We will now consider the specifics

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
of short-term planning.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It consists of assessing the current needs

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
in financial funds

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and determining short-term sources of financing.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Please look at the slide.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
From the previous table of financial sources,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
short-term sources,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
external and internal sources,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
are highlighted.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
External sources of financing

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
are loans and loans,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
and debt to suppliers and contractors,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
credit debt.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Internal sources are debt on taxes and fees,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and loans on fees,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
invoices, and interest.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Short-term sources of financing

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
are also overdrafts,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
commodity loans.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
The definition of the current needs

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
in short-term financial funds

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
is carried out

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
using a special table of money flows

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
called the cash flow plan.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
We emphasize that this is a short-term plan.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It is a short-term plan

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
that is not a cash flow plan,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
but a short-term plan.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Please look at the slide.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
The main contents of the cash flow plan

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
are presented.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The cash flow plan includes

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
sales receipts,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
operating payments,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
payment of supplies,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and all this

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
is short-term.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The cash flow plan is a short-term plan

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
that is not a cash flow plan.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Now let's look at

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the routine planning processes

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
of the business.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Again,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
we have a simplified example.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
We have the accounting data

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
for December.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
The next slide, please.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
We have a sales receipts forecast

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
for January, February, and March.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
We can see

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
what is planned for us.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
The revenue from the implementation

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
is planned to be sold

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
at 250, 200,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and 250 units per month.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
at 250, 200, and 250 units per month.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Moreover,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
we let go of the vast majority

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
of goods on credit.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
We receive only a small amount of goods,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
10%,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
at the moment.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
at the moment.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You can see

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
how we have the

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
revenue plan ratio,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
the revenue plan ratio,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
the implementation plan,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and the sales receipts plan.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
The December implementation

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
in the amount of

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
350 cash units

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
is due in January.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And only 25 units,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
10% of 250,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
we receive

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
in this period.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Next,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
we have to plan

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
the sales receipts plan

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
in accordance with the planned

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
sales receipts.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The sales receipts are calculated

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
for our revenue,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
for our sales volume

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
in the amount of

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
80, 100, and 140 cash units.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
All sales receipts

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
are implemented

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
with a payment period

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
of a month.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
We pay for the sales receipts

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
in December in January,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
in January in February,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
in February in March.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
These inconsistencies

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
in the payment and

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
the payment and the payment

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
receipts, we have planned

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
in the long-term plan

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
within the framework of the

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
turnover capital calculation,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
very largely.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Here, when we make

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
the cash receipts,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
we plan in this way.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You can see the final cash receipts plan

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
on this slide.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Here, the balance of cash

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
receipts,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
receipts and payments,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and the balance of receipts

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and payments increases

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
the balance of cash receipts

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
at the end of the period.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
We planned more or less successfully here,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
we have no problems.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
But if the cash receipts plan shows

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
a deficit of cash,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
then it is necessary to provide

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
short-term financing.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
This is due to additional

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
interest payments.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
As an alternative,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
you can use the cash receipts plan

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
to put things in order

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and provide some transfers

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
between receipts and payments.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
The cash receipts plan allows

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
to predict the moment

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
when we will have a short-term

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
financing and choose the optimal

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
way to meet this need.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And if we have

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
super-normal cash receipts,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
we must

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
within the framework of

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
management and optimization of

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
these receipts, put the free

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and super-normal

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
receipts into liquid value

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
securities.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But since we work in a very

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
uncertain structure,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
when we can always make some

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
changes,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
we have a special function

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
of planning,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
a sign of planning,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
adaptability of planning.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
We must flexibly

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
anticipate all these changes.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
When we have planned

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
some parameters,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
indicators,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
we must always keep in mind

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
that there will be a need

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
to review them.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Flexibility of planning,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
adaptability of planning

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and the possibility of

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
making adjustments.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
It is very convenient

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
to use electronic tables

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
for this.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It is cheap, fast

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
to review the entire planning process,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
to put everything in order,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
to review the planned task,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
to see what we have in the end

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and to form an optimal

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
plan that satisfies

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
both the owners and managers.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
A plan

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
that will not

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
cause doubts

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
when creditors need it.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Today we have covered

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
the conceptual basis, essence

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and features of financial planning.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
In the first chapter

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
we have identified the target parameters

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
of planning,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
learned to divide long-term

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and short-term planning,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
strategy and tactics of the company.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
We have considered the processes

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
of forecasting of money flows

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
as a basis for ensuring

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
financial balance.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
This is the subject of the current planning.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We have considered

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
the main methods of managing

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
the company to optimize

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
the tax payments.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
We have considered

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
the methods of forecasting

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
the needs in investments,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
the sources of financing.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
We remember the rules

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
of financing,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
we remember the risk that lies

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
behind making every decision

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
about investments and financing.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Then we have touched

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
on short-term planning.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
We have considered the technique

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
of cash flow planning,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
the necessary technique,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
the useful one,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
which we can use every day.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Thus, we have highlighted

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
and, in general,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
we have implemented

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
the problem of financial planning

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
as a necessity of the current

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
and operational monitoring of plans

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
to optimize the financial cycle.
