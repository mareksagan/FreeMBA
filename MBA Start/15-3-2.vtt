WEBVTT

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.010
I am conducting a pre-project survey.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.570
This is what I call a project.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.310
I am investigating the current situation.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.810
Suppose I learned that tomorrow

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.050
one of the managers will have a

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.970
state when he must start work,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.210
drawing up a package of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.590
documents for the opening of

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.950
the project.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.030
I am preparing this event so

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.850
that it will be successful.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.650
Once again, say, at home or

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.750
late at night, looked at individual

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.650
details of working with the tool.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.930
I was prepared to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.510
focus on success.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.650
I come in the morning and start this event.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.410
That is, I take the task that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.890
this ordinary employee-manager

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.050
must perform, fix that it was

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.910
in this state, zero, and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.370
fix the time that is needed

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.850
to make a full package

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.610
of documents for the project

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.050
to open.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.070
As I have prepared for this and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.790
understand the tool, I know where

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.490
the patterns lie, where the works.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.450
That is, in principle, this

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.170
tool is not used in a vacuum,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.530
but it is used in combination

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.010
with some system, with service

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.990
processes, and so on.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590
Naturally, there must be

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.850
accompanying processes that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.450
increase the productivity

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.350
of these managers.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.840
We will talk about project

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.220
management later.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.020
I start working, while fixing

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840
the start time.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.720
All the people in this group

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.900
see how I work.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.740
I am set to complete the whole

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.060
process in 4 hours.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.600
Within 4 hours, I send my result

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.500
according to the standard scheme of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.540
document coordination.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.200
It is also recorded, let's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.420
say, in the project management

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.300
position.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040
And there in this scheme you need to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.000
go through coordination with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.020
all responsible persons, for example,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.000
the chief technician, chief

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.440
accountant, lawyer, and so on.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.900
That is, the quality of my work I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.820
have to check by the results of the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.400
agreement procedure.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.420
And if we, for example, have

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.100
this procedure prescribed in the project

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.580
management position and it

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.600
takes 2 days, then I tell my

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.700
colleagues that in 2 days we will

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.860
open the coordination base and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.600
see the outcome of my work.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360
After 2 days I return to this group,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.380
open this coordination base

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.600
publicly in the presence of employees.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.620
Since I initially planned

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.640
everything in such a way that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.380
I could really the goal of this

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.340
sub-project, this event,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.800
I see the corresponding

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.460
results there.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.620
That is, the procedure of coordination

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.760
passed, with small comments, but

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.460
the general conclusion of this tool,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.540
which is usually illuminated

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.940
on the screen or resolution,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.760
is executed.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.720
Thus, I publicly record that in 4 hours

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.980
I developed a package of documents

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.760
for the opening of the project.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.620
At the same time, I clearly fix and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.740
tell employees that this function

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.440
is not really mine.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.380
I am a manager of another level and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.340
I have a different function, coordinating

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.640
other processes, managing

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.560
other processes, and so on.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.820
And I don't have to be a guru

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.960
in this tool, in this function.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.480
And these managers, they position

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.680
themselves as professionals.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.860
The time I spent with

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.700
him was 4 hours.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.480
Suppose we have an internal

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.780
dispersion among this type

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.060
of projects, yet there

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.140
are more complex ones.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.140
Or, let's say, the person,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.860
the manager there some internal

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.260
force majeure circumstances and so on.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560
We take this time, 4 hours

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.880
multiplied by 2 and record

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.440
that the given volume of work,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.620
this work should be completed

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.960
in no more than 8 hours.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.940
Thus, we record the labor

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.720
costs for this work, 8 people

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.900
hours.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.880
If it is a job in which I do not understand,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.260
in which I am not a specialist,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.180
I can organize an event

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.260
like this in the following way.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.380
I attract a resource that

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.860
understands this work and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.920
is able to publicly

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.900
demonstrate how it

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.620
does the work.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.440
And in my typical mode, I invite

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.660
this specialist either from

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.740
another unit or from another

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.220
department, or I can invite

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.120
a specialist from another

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.260
organization.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.340
We organize a workplace in this group

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.120
so that they see everything as and what

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.000
is happening.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.540
At the same time we adjust or,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.640
as we say, improve skills, train staff.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.580
However, in the free mode, without

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.340
stress, a person in comfort

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.480
performs this job.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.480
We record the time of its execution.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.020
Thus we get away from the negative

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.520
properties of the tool that we

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.560
used to use earlier, from the photo

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.480
of the day.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.140
More constructive is the

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.560
productivity of work.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.420
There are other technologies

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.400
for productivity measurement.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.160
We will not stop at them.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.840
Go to the next column.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.360
Cost or cost.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.960
For the management of the enterprise,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.200
for the relevant top managers,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.820
an important question in project

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.660
planning is the estimation of the

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.440
project budget by cost.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.900
Therefore, we develop structural

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.800
decomposition of works in such a

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.220
way that the cost column, first

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.660
of all, was an estimate of

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.780
the cost of the works, tasks, activities

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.240
that we perform in the project.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.680


00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.360
If we are talking about the

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.840
supply of hardware or software,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.320
the supply of materials, then here

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.660
we can put the value of the delivery

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.780
contract or the numbers from

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.120
the invoices.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:04.720
Why is it?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.880
Because this is the amount,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.280
this estimate is for us a cost

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.460
of cost.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.240
If we are talking about

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.980
estimating the cost of the work

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.440
that our employees perform, we can

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.560
also assess it professionally.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.000
This is, of course, the experience and

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.100
knowledge of professionals,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.380
accountants, economists.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:38.000
The cost of the resource is used

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.280
in this assessment.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.200
For example, we had work costs,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.920
six people alone, and this work

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.520
was done by a certain resource,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.600
a certain person who occupies

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.500
a certain position.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.700
We estimate the cost of this resource,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.820
that is, how much a person's

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.380
hour of the resource costs.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.020
Moreover, these figures,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.300
an estimate of the cost of the resource,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.720
they are not usually confidential.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.880
The cost of labor resource, it

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.420
consists of wages, plus the

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.340
cost of infrastructure that

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.500
provides the work of

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.920
the employee.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.140
Moreover, as a rule, the cost of

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.480
infrastructure providing the

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.960
work of the employee, it dominates

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.720
significantly over the

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.820
cost of wages or over the

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.140
size of wages or salary

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.880
fund.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.840
Moreover, the ratio between

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.080
the cost of infrastructure providing

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.000
the work of the employee and

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.200
his salary changes in the direction

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.300
of increases when the transition

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.740
from a lower hierarchical

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.500
level to a higher.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.780
For example, for the general director,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.740
this ratio can be very large,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.960
say, 20 to 1, and for a regular

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.860
slug or technician, it can

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.100
be a ratio of 2 to 1 or even

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.480
1 to 1.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.900
In any case, we understand that when

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.300
assessing the cost of a resource,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.200
we must first of all carefully

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.300
and professionally assess the cost

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.720
of the infrastructure that

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.040
provides the operation of

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.660
the resource.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.340
This is a separate topic for conversation

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.800
and assessment, but let's limit ourselves

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.320
to taking these assessments from professionals

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.120
who carefully, professionally

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.400
calculate these values.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.440
Suppose the cost of this resource

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:19.760
is equal to 1,000 rubles per

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.640
person hour.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.800
Then, if a person spent 10 people

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.540
hours, then the cost of this

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.640
work will be 10 thousand rubles.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.240
We understand that different resources,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:48.000
different people, they will have different

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.740
costs in the project.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.320
Labor resources are usually divided

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.300
by categories and their cost is

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.180
calculated on average.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.820
Suppose the category

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.620
of engineers-installers,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.460
software engineers, middle-

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.560
level managers, top managers

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.660
for each category determines

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.480
the cost of the resource.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.920
This is all included in the financial

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.920
and economic accounting subsystem.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.340
If we have a working project management

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.740
system and a tool, for example,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.140
the same Primovera, then we must,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.660
by connecting Primovera with

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.320
the financial and economic accounting

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.080
system, obtain this information

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.100
and count the cost of work, the

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.800
performance of tasks, activities

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.340
in such a way that we have

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.220
all these figures correspond

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.940
to reality and they

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.980
have been verified

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.560
at a professional level.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.900
The next column of structural

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.920
decomposition of works is the labor

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.840
resources or human resources.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.880
And it is filled in such a way that

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.760
we preserve the principle of unity

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.400
and preserve the principle or follow

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.880
the principle of creating a stable

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.760
configuration, a reliable configuration,

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.220
that is, minimize the

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.480
risks of failures in performing

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.240
a particular job, solving

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.740
a particular task.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.540
In the first place among

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.020
the list of labor resources

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.040
must be fixed responsible

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.400
performer, and then the perpetrators

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.840
go on, let's say, as their

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.300
responsibility falls, and

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.380
never one work can have two

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.100
responsible perpetrators.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.160
In cases where we have two responsible

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.700
executives at one job,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.820
we put the source of future

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.160
conflicts in such a situation,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.040
which in the people

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.120
are called management

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.080
football.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.640
That is, let's say that we have

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.000
a job and it has two

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.980
responsible executives.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.660
Project management is usually

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.500
aimed at ensuring that in case

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.740
of problems in the execution

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.600
of work, the solution of a task,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.100
we, managers, solve this

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.040
problem positively.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.640
Here in the work there is a problem and

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.380
the manager is involved in this problem,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.000
and here two responsible executives.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.680
We start to deal with one.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.560
He says it's not me, it's the grass.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.720
I start to deal with Grishka, and

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.300
he says it's a mouse.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.480
This is typical management

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.400
football.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.280
Conflict has arisen.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.920
A confusing situation arose.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.960
And this situation arose because

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.300
we do not know one of the basic

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.820
axioms of management.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.360
Get away from ambiguity.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.300
In this case, we should

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.560
actually appoint a responsible

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.540
executor.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.620
On the other hand, if the work is important

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.460
and very meaningful, we should pay particular

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.760
attention to the sustainability of

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.280
the implementation of this work.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.400
That is, if, let's say, we have

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.040
one responsible performer and he

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.860
got sick, or urgently went somewhere,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.720
let's say, on a vacation or a business

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.940
trip or on a vacation, and

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.740
so on, we have to have another

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.000
responsible performer at work.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.700
And here is what I said, when

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.180
we build performers on a given

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.660
job according to the rating

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.580
of responsibility, then in the

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.520
absence of this responsible performer,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.320
his function should

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.040
be automatically absorbed

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.960
by the next person, who

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.120
is in the list of performers

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.760
on this job, on this task.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.040
If we have this principle

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.220
preserved when setting up the

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.420
system, if this principle is fixed

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.640
in the regulations on project management,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.340
say, in the position on project management,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.920
then all these conflicts, the solution

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.920
of these problems can be delegated

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.760
to the system of technology.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.820
From the point of view of management,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.940
these problems are routine, and we

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.560
should not load the project

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.820
manager, the project manager,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.000
with such small questions.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.320
That is, our system, the same Microsoft

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.540
Project Server, can be configured

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.640
in such a way that in case of a request

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.900
for information from the responsible

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.440
executive and after the end of,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.940
say, an hour, if we have it prescribed

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.780
in the position on project management,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.860
the senior management did

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.980
not receive a response to this

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.900
request, the next responsible

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.520
executive is automatically

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.340
asked, and the situation is

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.840
fixed in such a way that

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.060
the work never left without

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.840
the responsible executive.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.540
It can also be algorithmized and transformed

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.860
into a technology chain,

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.320
giving this process to

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.420
technology and tool.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.180
That is, if we had only three

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.800
people responsible for the work,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.780
and all of them are currently unavailable,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.500
all three resources

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.260
are unavailable, immediately

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.580
this situation becomes a responsible

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.000
manager, say, the

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.540
project administrator.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.120


00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.940
That is, information about such

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.600
a situation by the system is provided to

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.680
the responsible executor for the entire block

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.480
to the higher level.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.300
Here are about what basic

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.460
principles we use when compiling

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.760
the column, labor resources

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.220
or human resources.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.520
The next column is the priority of

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.360
the task or task.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.040
Priority of task, priority of work is an

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.680
important parameter in the management

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.200
of the subject area of the project.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.080
This parameter is used when allocating

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.820
resources to a task, to a project,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.020
when solving problems related

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.140
to conflict of resources, resource

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.220
overload, when solving problems

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.840
related to conditions of tough

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.760
competition, struggle within

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.340
the project for resources in conditions

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.640
of limited resources.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.980
The higher the priority of the

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.080
task or work, the more resources

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.040
are provided for this task or work.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.540
We will touch a little further on the

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.280
role of priorities and tasks.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.020
We have partly considered the role

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.560
of project priorities when we talked

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.060
about project portfolios.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.040
In general, structural decomposition

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.680
in this form is often used in practice.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.560
Almost all project management

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.600
tools use structural

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.900
decomposition of

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.080
work in this form.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.380
In this table, one of the most

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.860
significant or time-intensive

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.740
columns is the third column, namely

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.820
the number of the previous work

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.040
or task.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.980
At first glance, it seems that it is

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.740
very simple, but if you approach

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.060
more carefully, if you analyze the successfully

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.780
completed projects, complex complex

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.660
projects, then we will see that

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.880
this column is one of the defining

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.600
structural decomposition

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.020
of work.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.780
This column defines the logic

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.400
of the work in the project.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.740
It defines the overall design of the

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.180
management process of project management.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.880
This column depends on the project

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.940
time, budget, and many

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.600
parameters.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.480
Experienced managers of enterprises

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.740
to assess the level

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.840
of professional manager first of all

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.520
turn to this column in the analysis

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.960
of structural decomposition of work.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.160
Priority of tasks, priority of work

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.260
is an important parameter in

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.960
the management of the project area.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.440
This parameter is used when allocating

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.840
resources to the task, work.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.060
It is used in solving problems

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.440
related to conflicts of resources.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.320
It is used to solve problems

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.420
related to the fact that we work

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.160
in conditions of strict

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.620
resource limitation.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.960
And it is clear that the higher the

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.680
priority of the task or work, the

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.660
greater the amount of resources

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.000
provided for this work or task.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.900
We have already partially considered the

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.500
priority of projects when we talked about the

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.040
portfolio of projects.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.140
And we will briefly touch on

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.920
priorities and priorities of work.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.500
In this form, as you can see in

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.260
this slide, structural

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.260
decomposition of works is

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.340
used in almost all project

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.200
management tools.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.140
In this table, the most significant

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.660
is the point that is very difficult

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.540
to correctly compile the

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.360
data in the third column.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.800
The third column, the number of

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.520
the previous work, the

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.200
prior task, is one of the most important

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.760
in the structural decomposition

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.080
of the work.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:04.200
From this column depends the

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.960
logic of the project.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.820
Here we can see how we managed

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.520
to professionally accompany, to

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.660
coordinate work with each other.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.540
How we were able to solve logical

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.220
problems associated

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.820
with simultaneous execution of

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.220
several parallel works at once.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.800
This column generally defines the duration

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.860
of the project, the cost and allocation

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.560
of resources.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.520
It affects and affects almost

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.740
all aspects of project

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.660
management.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.120
An experienced manager of the enterprise

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.100
to assess the level of professionalism of

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.880
the manager first and foremost in the

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.500
analysis of structural decomposition

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.980
of works pays attention to this column.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:14.720
If the number of works is used

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.020
rarely in this column, this

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.920
is a sign that the parallel

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.860
of work in the project is very low.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.900
This suggests that the power of professionalism

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.000
of the one who made up

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.220
such structural decomposition

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.620
of works is low.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.520
On the other hand, if we see

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.860
in this column the absence of

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.360
a number, except the number

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.760
of the last work, it indicates

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.540
that this work is not a precursor

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.640
to any of the work of

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.060
the project.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.460
In fact, she is not needed.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.780
And then an experienced manager

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.460
simply has the right to cut off this work.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.760
On the other hand, if we see that

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.260
some works start without a predecessor,

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.800
except for the first work,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.060
then we understand that this means

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.480
that there is a significant

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.640
portion of chaos in the project.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.020


00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.980
This is because this

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.740
work came from nowhere.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.040
And then an experienced manager also has

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.440
the right to remove this job from the

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.600
list of jobs.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.160
If we take the column

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.520
"Cost of work", summarize

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.760
it all, then at the output

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.480
we get the project budget by cost.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.580
It is clear that this column can

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.140
be read in different versions.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.500
For internal use, the structural

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.680
decomposition of works is prepared

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.820
in such a way that, first of all,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.560
it really provides the internal

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.560
information that is necessary for

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.020
the management of the project

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.780
in the given organization.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.880
And from this point of view, of

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.180
course, the structural decomposition

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:41.500
of works is presented in this column by cost.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.220
If we use this table for external

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.680
organizations, then in this

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.180
column we must take into account

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.980
administrative costs,

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.320
on-board costs or, as they

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.900
say, take into account

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.260
the margin factor.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.760
And then this column has a different

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.840
look.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.700
In addition, there are different

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.160
representations of the structural

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.520
decomposition of works in terms of the

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.660
estimation of the cost, and all this

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.700
depends on the consumer of this

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.480
table of this document.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.920
If you take the length of the

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.660
task or work, then simply

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.760
summarizing the data

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.960
in the column will not answer

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.820
the question, but how

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.660
long will the project take.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.300
This is one of the central issues that

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.600
interests, first of all, the management

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.780
of the company.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.000
And it is understandable why we cannot

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.180
answer this question by simply summarizing

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.280
the data in the length of

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.920
the task column.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.660
Because we are dealing with

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.540
a project, project activity.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.200
We again recall the definition of a

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.640
project, an event carried out within the

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.100
framework of limited resources.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.480
This means that we do not use

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.520
the method of consistent

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.560
planning in virtually

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.560
any project, as I said.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.520
This method usually leads to the

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.780
fact that we have a very long

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.240
project duration.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.560
This is not usually done by any

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.000
organization manager.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.920
And if we give him an estimate of the duration

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.520
of the project in this form, of course,

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.520
immediately followed by a clarification

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.480
or a request to re-examine the duration

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.320
and compress it as much as possible.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.540
Thus, we understand that

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.340
in project activities we

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.260
always use parallel work.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.020
We plan to perform the work in such

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.520
a way as to parallel them to the

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.040
maximum and to shorten the total

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.860
time of the project.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.220
This means that before we assess

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.880
the overall duration of

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.700
the project, we must

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.000
clearly structure the logic

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.220
of the task and work.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:39.400
That is, we must clearly identify the

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.480
data for the third column, namely

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.220
by the numbers of the previous works.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.540
In combination, the third column

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.980
and the length column, this combination

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.980
leads to the fact that we can build

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.040
a network model of the project,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.800
make a calendar

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.920
and network schedule.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.740
And only after we make a calendar

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.460
and network schedule, we

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.200
can answer one of the central

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.660
questions of project management,

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.360
what is the duration of this

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.820
project.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.220
We will return to this when

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.140
we consider the functional area

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.500
of project management by

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.960
time parameters.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.140
In general, if you consider

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.640
the structural decomposition of

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.720
works for complex complex projects,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.660
then in practice it turns out

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.920
that the number of works

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.720
present in this table can

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.900
reach several thousand.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.800
Sometimes even 20,000.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.800
I had several projects that

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.220
had about 30,000 tasks on

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.360
the list.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.080
It is clear that in such a situation it

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.240
is not very easy to make the structural

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.280
decomposition of the work itself.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.200
And most importantly, it is not

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.460
very easy to manage this document.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.690
After all, we must remember another

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.490
fundamental axiom of

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.390
management that says the following.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.450
A managed document is a document

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.530
that is visible.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.370
In other words, a visible

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.730
document, a managed document.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:50.210
And this axiom is based on some psychological

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.710
aspects of the perception of

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.310
information by a person.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.850
A person is hard or almost not

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.490
perceive information presented

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.610
in the form of tables with a

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.910
size of more than 20 to 20.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.730
That is, if we provide

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.530
information in the form of a

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.010
table, and that table

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.470
has more than 20 columns, let's

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:24.910
say 50.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.270
And the number of lines is more than 20,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.810
let's say, 1000.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.330
The person cannot adequately

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.730
perceive, analyze and work

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.050
with this information presented

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.630
in this form.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.270
It is clear that in order

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:49.190
for information to be more effectively

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.930
accessible to the recipient, so that

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.130
it is adequately perceived,

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.870
we must somehow either crush it,

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.290
or ultimately still present it

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.870
in the form of tables.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.450
If we decide that we will give it

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.250
in the form of tables, the

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.110
size of these tables should not

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.770
exceed 20 by 20.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:15.110
From this it is clear that we should

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.470
group the work that we have noted

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:23.730
in this table into separate blocks.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.460
And these groupings of works

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.300
are always present in real projects,

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.240
in real structural decompositions

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.620
of works.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.900
And many tools are configured

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.680
in such a way that they allow

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.760
the person working from

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.180
this table to see if a

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.780
task or work has been

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.380
decomposed into components.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.760
Is this work a separate

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.240
block or is it a separate

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.680
work of a lower level?

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.680
And this information is usually displayed

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.620
in one of the columns of the

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.840
table, and there we see a sign, a

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.740
plus or a minus icon.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.240
If the plus icon is worth,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.840
this work is decomposed

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.440
and it is a block.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.000
This decomposition can have

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.500
several levels.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.720
That is, we can break down

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.820
the top level, say, 20 blocks.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.260
Then each block is decomposed

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.500
to the next level, 20 sub blocks.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.720
Each block we decompose to

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.940
the next level, also by 20,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.700
by 15 and so on.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.600
In structural decompositions of works

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.180
on large projects we can observe

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.120
7, 8, and sometimes 9 levels

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.200
of investment.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.320
Thus, we see that in the real

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.200
conditions of use of structural

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.700
decomposition of works we must

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.860
use levels of invested up

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.740
to the point that every time we

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.660
look at this table, there are

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.700
no more than 20 lines, 20 works

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.960
in front of our eyes.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960
So that they can really

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.020
be viewed, analyzed.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.580
On the scale of the entire enterprise,

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.720
the structural decomposition of

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.660
works looks like the list of

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.200
projects in the portfolio.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.560
Or if projects in the portfolio of

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.240
the enterprise are many, then we introduce

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.680
additional sections or blocks by

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.160
portfolios.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.860
As I said before, for example, we

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.800
block projects in a portfolio by

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.400
character of organizational

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.760
affiliation or according to the

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.240
organizational structure.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.860
That is, let's say, if we are talking about

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.100
the portfolio of the holding, then we

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.700
divide it into departments corresponding

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.720
to subsidiaries, organizations that

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.200
are part of this holding.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.340
And in any case, structuring is

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.300
done so that it is easy and convenient

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.900
to perceive and analyze

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.940
information.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.780
In almost all instruments and in

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.800
many methodological

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.720
recommendations, the structural

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.180
decomposition of works is

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.040
in chronological sequence.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.420
This sequence is convenient for the project

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.300
manager, convenient for the main

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.080
part of the project team members.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.960
But if you look carefully at the entire

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.120
pool of users of this tool,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.380
then we will see that some groups

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.680
of users of this tool, these

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.200
documents, do not adequately

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.060
perceive the information

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.060
that is presented in the structural

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.920
decomposition of works

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.320
with a breakdown in chronology.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.960
First of all, these are the

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.720
heads of functional units or

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.840
the heads of resource-containing

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.800
units, as we call them

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.380
otherwise.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.680
In matrix structures, we said

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.900
that in modern Russia, almost all

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.140
enterprises can be characterized

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.660
by matrix organizational structure,

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.400
but such groups of resources,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.940
such as managers of functional

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.440
units, do not perceive the

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.640
information presented in the

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.480
standard form, in which

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.440
they have work on chronology,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.860
and this information is

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.920
difficult to perceive by them.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.920
In practice, I have often encountered

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.480
the fact that it is the heads

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.520
of structural units, functional

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.960
units, that are categorically

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.520
against the use of such

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.520
a tool.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.920
Analysing the reason why these

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.380
people are negative about these

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.580
technologies, this

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.180
tool, we come to a simple

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.900
elementary conclusion.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.460
It turns out, if it is a complex

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.380
complex project, if in this project

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.480
20 thousand works, then any head

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.120
of a separate functional unit,

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.380
looking at such a structural

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.000
decomposition of works,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.160
he after some time, after

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.540
a minute or two finally begins

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.320
to express his opinion

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.780
that he does not understand anything

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.600
in this table, and he has the goal

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.420
or he needs this information

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.260
to determine what works

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.860
relate directly to his department,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.940
what people participate

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.660
in this project from his

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.000
department, what

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.760
work they perform, how

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.200
much they are loaded.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.000
And here, understanding these reasons,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.300
we come to the conclusion that for

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.200
this pool of consumers we should

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.380
make a structural decomposition

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.240
of works not by chronology,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.580
but by functional attachment.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.080
From this point of view, of course,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.300
the structure is going differently.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.120
And here we can hardly talk

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.940
about, say, some hierarchical

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.580
distribution of works, and

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.620
here the structuring is

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.080
based on the functional units.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.120
Although sometimes in Russian-language

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.000
literature we see that VBS is

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.400
translated as a hierarchical structure

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.580
of works.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.640
Well, the experience of using

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.600
this tool shows that it is more

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.880
correct to translate VBS into

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.780
Russian as SDR – structural

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.160
decomposition of works.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.800
So, we conclude that the information

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.580
presented in the structural

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.400
decomposition of works can

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.440
be given in different forms.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.720
And above all, we understand

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.920
that yes, we can give this information

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.980
in a chronological range,

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.180
but we can give this information

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.540
in a functional range,

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.940
or in the range of resources

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.840
to a pool, a division,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.980
a department, and

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.760
so on.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.820
And in real-world project management

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.220
systems, of course, we must be

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.300
able to present structural

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.300
decomposition of works

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.040
in the form that is most

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.660
convenient for different types

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.020
of consumers.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:01.970
Here on the next slide you can see an

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.190
example of a representation of

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:08.090
the structural decomposition of works

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.650
in the Microsoft Project tool.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.250
This is a fragment of a real project,

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.470
and you can see that the structure is

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.470
roughly the same as the one

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.050
we considered in the previous table.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.370
Yes, there may be additional

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.830
columns, there may be additional

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.930
information.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:36.570
Often, special coding of works

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.970
numbers is used in such a way

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.790
that it can then be easily made

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.710
a sample for individual types

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.770
of works and so on.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.950
If we talk about the use of the SDR

00:43:55.950 --> 00:44:01.670
by different roles by the members

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.350
of the project team, we understand

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.050
that according to these roles, according

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.170
to the functions that the individual

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.910
member of the team performs,

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.390
we must customize the appearance

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.670
of this table in such a way that, first,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.270
it is possible to present all

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.710
the information that is necessary

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.710
to perform these functions, and

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.990
secondly, that this representation

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.290
is convenient for analysis

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.850
and work with it.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.060


00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:39.500
From this we come to the conclusion

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.660
that in various automated workplaces

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.520
or abbreviated arms we use different

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.920
types and different settings

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.660
of structural decomposition

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.440
of works.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.860
Now we move to the next section,

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.060
to the next functional

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.980
area - project management

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.660
by time parameters.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.100
This is a very important section, and

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:22.020
it also plays a leading role in the

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.600
project management process.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.510
Project management by time parameters

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.170
depends methodically and technologically

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.850
on the type of project

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.950
we deal with.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.910
As well as the process and

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.690
technology of project management

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.430
in general depends on what project

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.950
by scale, by functional

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.470
accessory, what project comes

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:01.010
out after the project classifier.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.330
We said that depending on the type

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.510
of project we use different methods,

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.310
technologies and tools.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.590
We must understand this.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:14.970
When we now look at the functional

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.810
areas of project management,

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.010
we mean that we are working

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.330
on a complex, complex project,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.690
as I have noted earlier.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.410
When considering the functional

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.470
area of project management by

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.910
time parameters, we will also assume

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.870
that we are dealing with a complex

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.530
large-scale project.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.890
Thus, the start of project management

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.710
on time parameters essentially

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.210
begins with determining what

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.970
methods, technologies,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.890
tools we will use in

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.830
planning the organization

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.110
and executing the project

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.950
on time parameters.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:09.150
Naturally, in the early stages or in

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.850
the early stages of the project life

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:16.250
cycle, we evaluate the overall

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.270
project management strategy over time.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:24.270
We choose the most optimal

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.010
tool for project management

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.270
by time parameters.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.610
At the stage of choosing the ways of

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:36.810
implementation of the project,

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.950
we first assess the overall duration

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.810
of the project.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.070
And if we prioritize minimizing

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.990
the time of the project,

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.270
then we choose the path

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.830
that allows it to be done.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:58.290
After choosing this path, we begin

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:02.390
to plan the composition of the work,

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.890
the logic of the relationship of the

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.550
work, the processes, tasks and work

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.670
that go parallel in such a way as to

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.390
reduce the time of the project, if

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.350
we have a priority is this goal

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.250
to perform the project in the

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.430
shortest possible time.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.430
Here, planning is also going

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:30.390
by iteration methods, that is, we first

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.690
held the first round, a list

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.590
of tasks was made, a list of works

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:40.150
was decomposed, we looked at what

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.490
we need resources to implement

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.630
these works.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.550
We then compare with our real

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.490
resources allocation capabilities

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.150
and it is these real resources

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.250
allocation capabilities that dictate

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:59.170
to us then whether we can perform

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.310
this project at the given time

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.150
in this version of the logic,

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:09.050
in this version of parallel

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.110
work.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.630
After that, naturally, we will have

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.450
corrections on the time parameters

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.410
and we will make them, and the corrections

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:20.830
go to the point that we analyze

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:24.090
the quality of allocated resources,

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.270
the productivity of work.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:32.250
If we consider the results of the

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:33.790
projects performed, complex, complex,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.370
we will see that the duration of the

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:39.770
project is primarily negatively

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.990
affected by the re-evaluation of

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:46.550
the quality of resources.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.570
Let us remember the main definition

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.670
of the project.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.170
A project is an event carried

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.330
out within the framework of limited resources.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.450
And we usually have the

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:04.930
situation unfolding in such a way that

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.630
we work in a matrix structure.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.850
Resources are limited, including in

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.550
the matrix structure, and the matrix

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.330
structure has negative fundamental

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.150
properties.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.530
Allocation of resources, project

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.190
activities on the residual

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.330
principle, such as such

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.330
a fundamental negative property.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:32.420
And from here we understand

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.740
that the managers of resource-

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.660
containing units allocate resources

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.700
to the project and quality, including

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.760
residual principle.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.960
That is, in fact, they tell the

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.940
project management that the resource

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.220
is quality-appropriate and will perform

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.800
the project with your requirements.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.260
But then it turns out that we

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.620
received the resource in the project

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.500
not quite the quality that

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.080
the head of the resource-containing

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.040
unit declared to us.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.080
It turns out that this resource

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.520
has lower labor productivity,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.860
quality corresponding and

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.300
so on.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.060
As a result, we get a lengthy execution

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.480
of the task or task.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:28.800
As a result, we are breaking the scheduled deadlines.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.840
Here are some aspects of planning

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.540
project management by time.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.780
In general, it is clear that

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.680
we must carefully calculate

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.080
the duration of each work.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.180
Naturally, this duration, as we

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.640
have already noted earlier,

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.060
is determined by the functional

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.100
set of tasks that we will

00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.200
perform.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.580
Technological requirements,

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.720
technical limitations, and of

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.640
course, limitations on

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.280
the productivity of labor,

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.880
on the productivity of the

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.080
process involved in this

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.400
work.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.880
When planning work on time, we perform

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.660
several iterations, as a result

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.980
of which we get the so-called

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:31.340
approach to optimize the

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.920
project on time.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.200
That is, we use different technologies

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.860
so that with the maximum compression

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.180
of the project in time we

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:47.880
can successfully the project

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.220
goal.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.360
We must get a product or service

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.860
out of the product that will be

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.200
viable, self-consistent, and that

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.780
service, that product, that final

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.480
product will then be demanded

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.160
by the user in the way he expected.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.180


00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.120
And here we must carefully

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.020
track whether we have really achieved

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.700
the project's goals as planned.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:23.120
We understand that by reducing

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.800
time we may lose some quality

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.460
parameters or we may reduce project

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.560
execution time at the expense

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.860
of some product or service

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.720
features.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.440
We can reduce the time, while we can

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:47.580
change the project budget itself.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.020
As a rule, in most projects,

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.380
where it is about reducing

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.120
the time of the project,

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.500
we are forced to

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.320
add resources, production

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.500
capacities.

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.460
Instead of, say, one brigade, we are

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.140
forced to put two or three brigades

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.620
on this object, and then the time

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.820
of planned work, for which

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.560
additional resources are attracted,

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.500
is reduced.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:24.780
In general, if we look at some changes

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.340
in the project management process

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.400
over time, we see that any of

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.920
these changes, one way or another,

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.720
directly or indirectly, affect

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.260
other functional areas

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.360
of project management.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.980
Similar to the situation we considered

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.680
in the case of project

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.960
management in the subject area.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.200
Here the same philosophy works,

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.400
and we must remember that.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.040
So, we evaluated the duration

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.080
of the work, we determined the

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.240
logic of the relationship of the

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.560
work, the logic of the work, we iteratively

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.660
clarified and optimized

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.700
these processes by logical connection,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.960
by the duration of the work.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.620
After that, we fix our scheme in

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.460
the form of a working schedule.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.100
Sometimes this chart is called

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.280
a calendar-network chart, and indeed

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.680
this chart most often resembles

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.380
a grid in the form of a network.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.800
He is depicted.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.180
Why is it?

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.860
Because we have project

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.500
activities, and we perform

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.600
work in parallel

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.260
processes, parallel actions.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.820
If we had only a consistent

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.140
methodology used in

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.980
project management,

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.380
it would be linear planning.

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.780
In linear consecutive, one-

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.760
dimensional planning, in fact, the

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.900
load on management is absent.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.520
That is, if the head of the

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.620
organization sees in the third

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.520
column of structural decomposition

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.600
of the work, in essence, the first column

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.220
with a shift to one position, as we

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.820
have already noted, if he sees that

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.140
there is only consistent

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.400
planning, then it is clear that this

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.440
is a sign of the complete non-professionalism

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.860
of the manager, and that a method

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.720
is applied here that is not

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.780
typical for project activities.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.120
It is more typical for

00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.820
individual linear operations,

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:01.520
for linear planning, for

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.920
linear production chains.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.720
This specificity clearly enters into

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.540
the planning of the organization and

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.820
the execution of the project on time parameters.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:20.300
We always face problems,

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.140
such as those characteristic

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.240
of performing several

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.120
parallel actions,

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.860
several parallel

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.180
tasks.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.700
Before we make a calendar

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.220
and network planning, we

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.560
make a network model.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.700
Now we will briefly examine

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.000
some principles of time planning

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.440
and principles of network model,

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.120
on the basis of which the calendar

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.860
and network schedule

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.000
is then developed.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.620
Let us go back to the main phases

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.140
of project management.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.560
So, if we follow the general

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.960
strategic line, we also have the stage

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:18.320
of initiation, the stage of planning,

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:23.100
the stage of organization control,

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.040
the execution of the project on time

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.800
parameters, the stage of analysis

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.520
and regulation and the stage

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.660
of completion.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.320
The analysis and regulation stage is very

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.940
important.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.120
As a result of the project, we face various

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.580
circumstances that are not taken

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.500
into account in the planning documents,

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.300
which are not taken into account

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.900
in the development of the documents

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.400
for the opening of the project.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.360
It is clear that all these circumstances

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.660
cannot be taken into account in reality.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.520
And in principle, it is

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.860
a project that we always

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.780
face some problems, some

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.380
uncertainty, some new

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.240
elements.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.240
And hence it is clear that in the course

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.740
of the project implementation we will have

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.000
factors that affect the duration of the

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.900
performance of certain tasks.

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.840
And accordingly, we must react

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.960
in such a way that in the end, the

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.380
project was still successfully completed

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.920
and we did not break the overall

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.620
scheduled timing of the project.

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.620
Here, this is the subprocess, or

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.920
more precisely the stage of the

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.420
general process of project management

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.640
by time parameters, analysis

00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.880
and regulation.

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.200
That is, we are analyzing the deviation

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.340
of planned figures from actual ones, as

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.800
we have already considered this technology.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.160
We then develop an event to remove

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.560
the deviations, implement these

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.040
activities, respond to these

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.000
deviations and bring the

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.420
project into planned implementation.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.380
And the completion procedures are

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.760
roughly the same.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.000
We summarize the results of

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.440
project management on time parameters.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.740
We look at the strengths and weaknesses,

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.060
analyze them and offer recommendations

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.720
so that in the future, when

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.960
implementing similar projects or

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.420
projects in related areas, we

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.780
do not repeat the weaknesses,

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.760
do not repeat mistakes or,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.580
as we say, do not attack the

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.800
same grabbles.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.560
So, let's briefly consider

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.800
how we work in general when

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.980
planning timing and

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.180
managing a project by timing.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.700
In one of the first sections of this

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.400
course we said that we approach the

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.560
project as a single whole and that

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.960
we use a process approach and that

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.400
at the entrance of the project we

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.580
put a single goal setting, and

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.860
at the output we get a result

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.420
that is also one, self-consistent

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.020
and viable.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.280
As for project management by

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.400
time parameters, we usually

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.680
approach here using

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.620
the technology called

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.640
the Homax technology.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.280
This slide shows a project presentation

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.140
in the form of a Homax, and this presentation

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:14.320
describes the top level of the

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.040
project decomposition into

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.300
the most common task blocks.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.700
These task blocks are depicted

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.980
in the form of parallel

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.400
rectangles and in general

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.740
in the graphic reflection of

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:42.680
work and tasks parallel rectangles are used.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.360
If we have important work

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.240
or events in the project,

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.900
but the duration of which

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.200
may be low or near zero,

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.140
such work is called

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.020
milestones.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.640
In English milestone or in

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.420
Russian kilometre stone, kilometre

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.480
pillar in project management

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.680
we use the term milestone.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.660
The corner is depicted in the form of a rombo.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.300
As a rule, this important

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.140
event, significant event or some

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.620
result of work is reflected on

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:34.520
the schedule, this is a milestone,

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.860
a rombic.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:40.380
For example, we hold a meeting

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.360
and a meeting may last

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.580
a certain time.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.720
At the end of this meeting we

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.660
have some result, namely a protocol,

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.700
and we record at what time

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.940
we get this result of this

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.580
work.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.020
In general, if you consider

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.060
the structure of the project at

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.340
the top level, it can really be

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.500
depicted as a hamac.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.380
This is very convenient and we immediately

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.180
see what the main processes

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.420
that are parallel to the

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.900
project are.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.880
Then we can go to a more detailed

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.700
structured analysis of each

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.180
parallel task, to the decomposition

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.420
of this task or task block,

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.300
to individual tasks, sub-

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.100
tasks, individual work.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.100
And so we can already schedule

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.760
each branch separately until

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.460
separate works.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.360
We determine the duration of

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.640
each work, and if we now take

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.680
for each parallel branch, we

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.680
summarize the time of work.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.720
Naturally, we are building

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.080
these works according to

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.560
the logic that we have reflected

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.140
in the third column of the SDR.

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.340
We determine the maximum duration

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.900
of the work included in the

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.500
particular branch of the hamac.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.520
Thus, as we go through all the branches,

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.980
we determine the duration

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.340
of these parallel-going blocks

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.000
of tasks, parallel-going work,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.860
we summarize this duration

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.420
for each branch.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.820
And then we rank these total lengths,

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.760
that is, we find the shortest

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.260
length, the largest and the

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.320
longest branch.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.780
These are the works that

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.640
are on the branch with the

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.440
longest duration, we call

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.780
critical works or work that

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.280
is on the critical

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.560
path.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.420
The critical path is the path,

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.160
the duration of the work,

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.260
on which the sum is the maximum.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.780
The total duration of work on

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.020
the critical path and will be equal

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.520
to the time of the project.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.360
One of the key questions

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.620
of the project can be

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.100
answered as follows.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.440
The duration of the project

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.220
is equal to the duration of work

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.920
on the critical path,

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.100
i.e. the total duration of

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.680
work on the critical path.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.320
Naturally, we can only determine

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.180
this duration after first determining

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.520
the overall structure

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.800
of the project, what the

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:27.500
project model, then what

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:31.720
the network model.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.760
After that, we determine the

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.840
critical path in the network model

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.380
or in the network chart, and only

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.380
then can we answer the question

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.020
of what the project duration is.

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.260
In project activities,

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.720
different terms are used

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.860
related to project management

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.480
by time.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.880
One of the basic terms is network

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.600
model.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.980
The network model describes the overall structure

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.180
of the organization of the tasks and

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:12.860
work blocks in the project.

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:16.520
After we have already detailed

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.780
the relationship between

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.480
the works, sequence and this

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.620
network model, we build a so-

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.320
called network chart.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.180
After building a network chart and once

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:37.000
again clearly defining the duration and logic

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.520
of the relationship, building all the

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.260
logical connections, usually on

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.840
the charts, on the charts they are

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840
depicted with lines that connect

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.360
the rectangles of the task or work

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.560
and the rombics into landmarks.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.260
Then we attach our network

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.140
chart to the calendar, specific

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.040
dates.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.740
Each work has a calendar

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.120
of start and finish time.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.380
Then we get a calendar

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.420
network schedule.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.500
This way you can approximately

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.220
understand how the network model relates

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.960
to the network chart and the

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.460
calendar network chart.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.880
When we go to a more detailed

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.480
look at each of the branches

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.240
of the gamac, to a detailed

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.400
model and then a network

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.460
chart, we can use different

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.980
technologies, different

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.440
concepts.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.220
The following slide is an example

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.340
of the preceding diagram.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.000
On this chart, the work is constructed

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.820
in such a way that it is performed in

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:05.780
time, chronologically, from left to

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.500
right.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.000
And logical relationships here are

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.180
depicted in straight lines with arrowlights.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.640
In some situations, one work can

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.160
absorb the result of a

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.780
previous one work, and in some

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.400
situations, that work can

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.040
absorb the result of

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.600
several previous works.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.140
This is seen in the diagram.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.700
In addition, a chart is often

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.760
used, as you can see in

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.020
the following slide, the so-called

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.080
arrow chart.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:54.540
Here works are depicted with letters, arrows,

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.540
and the nodes of communication between

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:01.860
works are circles.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.640
Also the chronology or vector of

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.600
time here is located from left to

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.140
right.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.760
If we consider the logic of the

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.660
relationship between two separate works,

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.740
we will see that there are four possible

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.620
options.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.480
As you can see from the next slide,

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.400
we can establish four logical

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.060
relationships between two works,

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.560
namely the relationship finish-start

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.420
or end-beginning, finish-

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.820
finish, end-

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.900
end-start or beginning-beginning,

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:51.640
and start-finish, beginning-end.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.220
These types of connections are used

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.600
when working with different

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.260
graphic tools, with tools that

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.300
we have briefly considered,

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.640
with the same Microsoft Project,

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.000
Primovera, Spyder and

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.640
others.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.220
Many of these tools have a separate

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.660
parameter, which is called the

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:20.120
type of connection.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.340
It is quite convenient and

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.760
clear, we can unambiguously

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.060
use this parameter to link

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.040
two or more separate works.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.660
Interestingly, in many tools

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.420
with this parameter, the type of

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.680
communication is also used

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.240
as a delay or time lag

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.420
parameter.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.120
It is a very interesting parameter

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.160
and can also be used to improve

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.840
the efficiency of time

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.940
planning and project management

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.160
by time parameters.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.100
Often we have work going one after

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.840
another, but with some

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.560
delay then we mark this parameter

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.020
with a plus sign.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.100
Let's say we need to start the next

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.540
work after the previous one is

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.940
finished two days later.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.180
We put this parameter plus two

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.620
if we have days in measurement

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.640
units.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.760
It is interesting to consider a

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.740
situation when this parameter is a

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:42.400
minus sign, for example, minus two

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.300
days, this means that the delay

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.180
is negative or, in other

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.420
words, we can graphically represent

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.860
the advance.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.700
If we have a lag delay option

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.060
minus two days, it means that the work

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.000
begins after the completion of

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.480
the previous one with two days

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.220
ahead of the date of completion

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.600
of the previous work.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.020
That is, in such a situation, we have

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.080
a logic of communication

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.600
of work consistent, but work

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.360
can be performed in part, and sometimes

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.280
completely, in parallel.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.380
The procedure for using this

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.440
lag parameter with a minus

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.680
sign is usually used in

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:44.100
so-called time parameter management

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.540
optimization situations.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.340
That is, when consecutive

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.320
planning, we can quite significantly

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.240
reduce the total time of the

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.000
chain of tasks or works, using

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.920
this parameter lag with a

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.220
minus sign.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:08.140
If we use a lag with a minus

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.760
sign, we can actually significantly

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.360
reduce the time of a

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.600
task block or work chain,

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.640
but we must remember

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.240
another negative circumstance.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.280
In any situation of optimization of

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.960
work by time with any use of the parameter

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.100
lag with the sign of minus, we

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.380
can have a conflict of resources,

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:44.900
that is, overload of resources.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.400
When we shorten the time of a chain

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.700
of tasks or tasks so that

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.520
part of the work we do is done

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.280
in parallel, we see that the labor

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.300
resources, the people who do

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.420
those tasks, they can be

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.560
overloaded.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.040
That is, there is a overlap of two

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.900
jobs in such a way that the same

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.520
people are forced to do both work,

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.160
and if they are loaded at 100% in

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.040
one of the jobs, under 100% load

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.020
we understand 8 hours of working

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.000
time during the current day,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.380
then it is clear that when combining

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.200
two jobs this person can already

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.900
be overloaded.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.520
If in the second work a person

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.060
is loaded by 50%, then

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.900
in total it will be that this

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.540
resource is loaded by 150%

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.820
in a particular area

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.240
that is overlaped by two works.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.300
This is called a conflict

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.640
of resources, or overload of resources.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.660
Experienced project manager,

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.560
project manager initially when

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.600
planning a project on time parameters

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.940
tries to avoid conflicts

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.040
of resources.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.360
But if these conflicts have occurred,

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:21.380
then in principle any elimination

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.120
of the conflict of resources,

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.900
any elimination of the overload

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.640
of resources causes additional costs

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.760
of resources.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.480
For example, if we have a workforce

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.000
that is overloaded by 150% in

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.360
two jobs, we can eliminate

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.360
this conflict of resources

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.700
by taking both jobs in

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.620
a time-spread way to remove

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.780
parallelity.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.840
The conflict of resources is removed, but the

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.900
resource of time in such a situation is overused.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.960
We can eliminate the conflict of resources

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.140
by another method.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.500
We will take part of the work

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.440
or load from that employee to give to another

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.920
and clear the conflict.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.680
But still as a result we come

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.860
to the over-consumption of

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.300
labor resources, because if in the

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.120
first case we have work done

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.120
by one person, then in the second

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.460
already two people.

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:33.480
We may in some specific way or

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.400
allow within the framework

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.780
of the procedures adopted in

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.580
the enterprise that allow

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.060
the use of so-called overtime

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.160
schedules or overtime work,

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.760
to announce or agree on

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:52.660
this point where the workforce

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.420
will be overloaded.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.320
We can agree on this point with

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.280
his management, with him,

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.820
and agree that this overload

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.500
during the day, that a person

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.860
will work 4 hours more

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.440
than the quota, that is,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.780
he can work 12 hours, but

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:20.460
we will pay him 4 hours as

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.120
overtime.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:27.500
In any case, the conflict is cleared

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.860
here, but we still come to

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.900
the over-spending of resources,

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.080
that is, we will be forced to

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.300
spend extra money from the project

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.360
budget, that is, here the resource

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:47.420
is financial, it will be overloaded.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.600
As for overtime work, here in different

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.820
enterprises are different

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.180
and overtime pay is also made

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.920
differently, for example,

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.960
in the Soviet Union overtime

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.620
work was usually paid in

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.200
double amount, then if a person

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.840
went out to work acceptable

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.580
on weekends or at night

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:17.360
worked and it turned

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.400
out that he worked overtime

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.140
some schedule, then the

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.280
payment was made in double

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.840
amount.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.720
Now in many organizations this

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.280
payment is not in double, but

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.120
with a coefficient of 1 or 1.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.960
2 and this is done in order

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.480
not to motivate employees

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.600
to work in the non-main time.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.690


01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:53.170
But this is a separate problem, we will

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:55.790
not go deeper into it.

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:58.510
So, we briefly looked at why

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:00.850
there are conflicts of resources

01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:02.970
when managing a project over time

01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:06.950
and some techniques to eliminate

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:09.550
these conflicts.

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.620
Along with one of the basic concepts

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.300
in the functional area

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.780
of time management, such as

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.640
the critical path, other basic

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.340
concepts are used, which

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.620
are very important when managing

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:34.260
a project by time parameters.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.420
In the next slide you see a fragment

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.740
of the network chart.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.520
Here are some of the work that is

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.040
being done in the project.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.920
The top part depicts two works

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.780
that are part of the critical

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.500
path.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:05.260
If we have a time reserve for work

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.220
that is in the critical path, then

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.060
this time reserve is included

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.160
in the so-called overall project

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.760
reserve.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.560
In principle, it is understandable,

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.760
because it is the work that is

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.320
on the critical path that determines

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.040
the duration of the project in time.

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.920
And the reserves that work on

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.720
this path is included in the overall

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.140
project reserve by time.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.440
That is, if we have work on a critical

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.760
path with, say, a reserve of 5 days,

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.740
then this is the total reserve of the

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.400
project time.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.900
If we have a reserve of time for

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.420
work that is outside the critical

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.700
path, then, as a rule,

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.960
such a reserve is called

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.860
a free reserve.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.760
And this reserve when changing it usually

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.640
does not affect the overall

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.880
duration of the project.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:21.240
However, it should be remembered

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:27.130
that with increased reservation of

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:29.330
works that are not on the critical

01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:31.610
path, we may come to a situation

01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:34.910
where the total duration of work

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:38.530
on the branch outside the critical

01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:41.470
path may exceed the duration

01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:44.850
of work on the critical path.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:47.530
And then we will actually get

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.970
that the critical path has shifted

01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:53.410
from the previous option to the current

01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:54.810
one.

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:59.510
This often happens when we either

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:02.930
re-plane a project, or when

01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:05.850
we start a project, run it, and

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:10.910
start project tracking procedures

01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:12.790
on time parameters.

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:16.670
If we have until now some work

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:19.330
that is outside the critical path,

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.430
have been significantly

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:24.850
delayed, extended, and so on, then

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:27.630
we will see that when passing

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:31.110
the present moment these work can

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:33.550
start, so that in the parameters

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.110
that have changed they

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:39.170
will lead to the fact that

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:41.590
the critical path will change

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:44.410
its localization.

01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:46.950
That is, if it has been passed in

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:50.090
a certain way before this point, then

01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:53.590
after passing this point we will see

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:55.770
that the critical path will

01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:57.790
change its localization.

01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:01.390
These are pretty important points,

01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:03.710
and of course, project management

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:06.490
should be careful about changing

01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:09.650
the position of the critical path.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:13.830
We must understand that all the

01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:15.490
work that is on the critical

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:19.970
path, they have a fundamental

01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:22.410
impact on the time of execution

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:26.230
of the project, and we first of

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.330
all track them in such a way that

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:31.130
there is no delay in time.

01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:34.970
As a rule, work on the critical path

01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:39.470
is the first priority within the project,

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:42.250
and they are actually tracked

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.730
on the supply of resources,

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.770
on the implementation, on

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:50.930
the time priority.

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:58.400
If we consider in general how we

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.560
build a network model, we should

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.160
remember that we have a subject area

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.320
at the forefront of the project

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.280
management procedures, and

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.620
we should not forget that it is

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:19.400
the dominant in any project,

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.020
and the processes and works

01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.760
that are refined are allocated

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.380
to project management,

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:31.360
the project management process

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.520
itself is service-related

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.640
to the basic processes that

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.120
implement the subject area.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.180
The construction of a network model

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.000
begins with the construction of a network

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.240
model of work on the subject area.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.740
The following slide is an example

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.860
of a network model.

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.660
Here, the green color highlights

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:05.760
the task blocks on the subject area,

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.000
and the fistish color highlights

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.100
the works that refine the

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.080
processes of project

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.780
management.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.460
In principle, in any work,

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.940
in any task block, work block

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.240
on the subject area, there

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.060
are managerial labor costs.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:38.160
This management is usually carried

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.700
out primarily by the responsible

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.560
executive.

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.840
Here I would like to make some such

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.740
a comment on how we implement project

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.540
management in such a way that

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:56.000
we have sustainability in the course

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.760
of the project execution, sustainability

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.640
in the project management

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.160
process as a whole.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.870
Psychologists say that a person

01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:18.390
is arranged in such a way that his psyche

01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:23.570
gives sparring failures.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.890
That is, periodically, the human

01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:29.010
psyche fails in such a way that

01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:31.970
we cannot clearly predict

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:34.810
these failures.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:37.770
If we consider the process of project

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:40.510
management itself, it becomes clear

01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:45.390
that we manage only when we can predict

01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:49.050
the behavior of the individual,

01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:51.290
the behavior of the members

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.370
of the project team.

01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:59.990
If we can qualitatively predict

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:01.810
the behavior of the team members,

01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:05.230
then we manage the situation.

01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:07.730
If we can't predict the behavior

01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:10.150
of the team members, then

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:13.070
we don't manage the situation

01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:14.950
fully.

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:17.870
And then the manager becomes,

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:20.630
roughly speaking, a boy

01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:23.670
on the bedside of the situation.

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:27.030
And if you consider project

01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:29.290
management as a whole, then of course

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:32.050
the manager must manage the

01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:33.990
project, and the manager also manages

01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:37.030
the situation that develops

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:40.830
within or around the project.

01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:42.810
The higher the professionalism

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:45.730
of the manager, the more he can manage

01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:49.730
the situation in the project.

01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:56.410
But we see that the human psyche will

01:29:56.410 --> 01:29:58.650
fail sooner or later.

01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:05.770
In practice, the experience

01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:09.870
of many social groups, and even

01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:13.050
our Russian proverbs, reflect that

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:15.190
the human psyche really gives

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:17.750
periodic failures.

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:20.650
As we sometimes say, I don't know what

01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:22.910
happened, it was magic.

01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:26.290
It is said that only the person

01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:28.650
who does not work is not mistaken.

01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:32.270
That is, any person who works,

01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:34.410
he will sooner or later make

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:37.230
a mistake, make a mistake, and

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:37.770
so on.

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.310
It will be a sporadic failure.

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:45.250
And it is clear that in such a situation

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:46.690
we must consider very carefully

01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:49.370
how to minimize the negative

01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:53.570
consequences of mental failures.

01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:56.750
And it is understandable that the

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.530
higher the human labor resource in the

01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:01.070
hierarchical organizational structure

01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:04.010
of the project, the more significant are the

01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:07.390
consequences of the failure of the psyche

01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:08.650
of this person.

01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:12.070
That is, we should pay special attention

01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:17.530
to insurance failures, more precisely

01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:21.230
in the analysis of the negative

01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:25.270
consequences of these failures

01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:28.030
in each person.

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:32.670
First of all, those of our

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.410
team members who are

01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:36.790
responsible for the work and

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:40.270
above all for important work.

01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:43.310
We should pay special attention

01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:48.070
to the top management in the

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:50.170
project team.

01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:54.730
Thus, we understand that we must

01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:58.350
apply some technologies,

01:31:58.350 --> 01:32:00.030
tools to minimize the negative

01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:01.390
consequences of these

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:03.490
failures.

01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:07.750
Practice shows us that they

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.890
are usually minimized in such

01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:11.070
a way that someone

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:13.950
insures a person working

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:17.050
in such a way that he or she looks

01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:18.550
from the side, analyzes his

01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:21.150
actions, or as they say helps

01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:24.410
a person not to break

01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:25.590
the wood.

01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:28.710
In this situation, the proverb

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:31.070
is used, which says that

01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:35.090
one head is good, and two is

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:36.310
better.

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:39.710
It is clear that if we are committed

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:42.270
to the project being performed

01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:44.990
effectively with a minimum of labor

01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:49.010
costs, with a minimum of risks, with

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:51.390
a minimum of overall costs, then

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:54.050
we should pay attention to these processes,

01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:56.850
which minimize the negative

01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:59.370
consequences of sporadic failures

01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:00.830
of responsible executives,

01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:03.890
executives, managers, managers.

01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:07.250
Thus, we organize processes

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:11.670
that insure responsible

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:13.450
executives.

01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:17.010
And these processes are primarily

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.470
controlled by the project management,

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:22.710
the project manager.

01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:25.910
One of the main functions

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:28.310
of the project manager, it

01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:30.430
is reduced to what we can

01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:33.530
call control control.

01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:37.690
That is, the current tactical

01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:39.910
control of the performance of the

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:41.910
task or work is carried out by the

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:44.330
responsible executor, and additional

01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:47.590
control, which minimizes the risks

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:49.630
associated with sporadic failures,

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:53.690
with errors, what we have said,

01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:55.230
with the insurance of the

01:33:55.230 --> 01:33:57.630
responsible executor, this function

01:33:57.630 --> 01:34:00.150
is entrusted, first of all, to

01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:03.010
the project manager.

01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:07.090
And thus we in the network

01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:09.290
model, in the network chart,

01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:13.010
form refined work on project

01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:14.710
management.

01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:16.830
Works that are continuous

01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:19.210
in nature and cover the

01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:22.130
main composition of the

01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:24.130
project life cycle in the

01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:25.430
subject area.

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:28.190
In other words, we must organize

01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:30.830
project management in such a way

01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:34.250
that at any time, as we sometimes

01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:36.790
say, in the middle of the night,

01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:39.410
we raise the project manager

01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:41.090
or one of the managers

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:43.050
responsible for one or another

01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:45.210
area of management, and his head

01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:48.370
must be sick about the project,

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:50.630
or, as we say, he must hold

01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:53.130
his hand on the pulse of

01:34:53.130 --> 01:34:56.110
that controlled process.

01:34:56.130 --> 01:35:00.950
These works are presented separately.

01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:04.470
For example, in this network model,

01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:07.390
these are works that are continuous

01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:08.910
in nature and cover almost

01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:10.930
the entire life cycle

01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:12.390
of the project in the

01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:13.310
subject area.

01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:15.630
This is control of the document of turnover

01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:18.030
and reporting, control of changes,

01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:19.490
control of risks.

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:24.610
This slide shows a network model

01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:32.450
that operates with seven parameters.

01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:33.990
This is called a

01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:36.490
semiparametric network model.

01:35:37.450 --> 01:35:40.110
In practice, we sometimes use an

01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:42.370
eight-parameter model, another

01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.610
parameter is added, it is missing

01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:47.430
here, namely, near the work you

01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:51.350
see a separate image of work with

01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:55.910
seven parameters on the right.

01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:58.370
Near the work is still fixed the number

01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:02.190
of work, that is, the mathematical

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:03.730
value with which it is easier

01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:08.730
to operate a computer or instrument.

01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:11.290
There are seven main parameters.

01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:14.690
This is the name of the work, duration,

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:15.890
time reserve.

01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:18.550
Early beginning, early

01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:21.930
end, late beginning, late end.

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:25.850
A network model of the project

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:29.250
is usually developed at the beginning

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.770
without a specific link to

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:33.350
the calendar schedule.

01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:38.130
Coordinates are used in terms of

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:40.050
time, and are relative.

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:43.130
Once the network model is

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.570
already finalised,

01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:46.590
several iterations will be

01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:48.210
made to clarify.

01:36:48.210 --> 01:36:51.150
Only then can we take the relative

01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:54.470
coordinates of the network

01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:59.770
model or network chart and attach

01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:02.870
to a specific calendar.

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:06.870
Here it is seen that the first

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:11.210
work begins with a zero date, that

01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:12.810
is, the relative coordinates

01:37:12.810 --> 01:37:15.310
in time are taken for zero.

01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:22.130
And then all the work already uses

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:25.690
relative to the first work,

01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:28.230
relative to its start, time parameters,

01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:31.430
which consist of the sum of duration

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:33.150
and the sum of reserves

01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:36.330
by duration.

01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:42.970
In accordance with the third column of

01:37:42.970 --> 01:37:45.970
the network chart, that is, with

01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:49.890
logic, we prescribe the second column

01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:54.670
of the structural decomposition of works.

01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:57.070
That is, we take a specific

01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:59.390
work and then look at

01:37:59.390 --> 01:38:02.010
who has its followers or who

01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:03.930
has its predecessor.

01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:06.730
And thus we build logical

01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:10.410
relationships on the network model.

01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:13.330
Well, by time we go through in such a

01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:15.270
way that we summarize the

01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:18.370
duration with the reservation and go

01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:23.210
from the first work to the final one.

01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:28.390
This approach is called the direct

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:29.990
passage method.

01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:33.350
And if we take and move from the last

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:37.950
work to the first, and at the same time

01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:42.690
we may not take into account the time

01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:48.570
reserve, then we carry out the

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:50.370
so-called reverse passage.

01:38:50.690 --> 01:38:52.170
When we go straight, we take

01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:54.790
into account the time reserve, the

01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:56.890
total time is summed up and we

01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:58.790
get the maximum duration

01:38:58.790 --> 01:39:01.410
of the project on the critical path.

01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:03.450
This critical path is

01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:06.270
marked by logical links

01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:09.070
of red.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.940
After the project is completed, we

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.480
can go back from the last work

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.800
to the first.

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.500
And so, if we have such parameters

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.640
as early beginning, early

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.380
end, then with the reverse

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.800
passage, when we deduct

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.540
the reserves of time, we

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.360
have parameters of

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.880
late end and later beginning.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.100


01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.660
After developing the network model

01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:41.580
and network chart on the subject

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.220
area, we can impose on the entire

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.240
subject area works of

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.020
a continuous nature, which continuously

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.220
monitor the progress of

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.240
the project execution on the

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.920
subject area and these work,

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.620
as I said, we refined.

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:04.480
Although we understand that some

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.860
part of the work on project

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.580
management, it is contained

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.180
in separate blocks, in separate

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.860
tasks on the subject area.

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:18.300
Here are some basic principles for building

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:22.280
a network model of the project.

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:26.120
Naturally, if you want to study more

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.800
in detail the practical methods

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.320
of project management on time

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.380
parameters, then this is a problem

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.040
of another course.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.080
Usually we have various courses

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.800
in the Russian market, including,

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.340
for example, specialized

01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.440
courses on the preparation

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.680
of calendar and network

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.340
charts, network models

01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:52.560
and so on.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.580
You can find out more

01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.560
in the literature attached

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:03.340
to this course.

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.040
In the literature list you can

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.480
find this information in more detail.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.260
Now we will consider in general

01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:15.600
what basic methods are

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.720
used in project management

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.600
by time parameters.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:26.700
Here on the next slide you will see

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.840
a list of these time planning methods.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.920
We have already met some of them,

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.580
let us briefly go through all

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.120
these methods again.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.020
The consistent planning method.

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:44.160
It is clear what it is, we considered

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.420
it when we plan work that is

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.000
performed in succession

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.660
one after another.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.300
Parallel planning is also

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.340
understandable when we work in parallel.

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.700
Method of stachastic planning.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:59.800
This method is inherent in projects where

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.440
there is no clear and unambiguous fixation

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.280
of the start date and the completion

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.180
date of the work or task.

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.560
This is typical for projects such

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.080
as the construction of a temple.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.820
Indeed, we cannot plan the

01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:19.680
execution of certain work

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.520
clearly here, as we have

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.920
largely uncertainties

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:28.000
about the arrival

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.600
of funds, budgeting,

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.340
and so on.

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:35.740
And here we plan the project in time

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.000
in such a way that we do not strictly

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.380
record all the start and end

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.200
moments of all the work included

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.240
in the project.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:50.060
Monthly planning method.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:52.660
It is clear about what it is.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.380
It was especially widespread

01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.560
in the Soviet Union, when there

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.740
were concepts such as a monthly

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.720
plan, a monthly rate, a monthly

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.800
rate.

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:10.220
And in this situation, we planned

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.000
project activities precisely

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.840
in terms of time.

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.600
In some enterprises, this approach

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.320
still exists, although if

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:26.780
we look at this method, which

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:29.140
worked in the Soviet Union,

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.360
we see that it has significant

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.460
disadvantages.

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:36.400
The method of monthly planning

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.560
led to the fact that the main volume

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.280
of work in the project activity

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.240
or in the production

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.260
it fell on the final days

01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:48.520
of the month.

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:51.720
And so there was planning

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.000
work that by the end of the month

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.800
we are obliged to the planned

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.760
indicators in any way.

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.780
And as a result we saw that with this

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:09.120
approach, the quality of products,

01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.760
the quality of services, the

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.940
quality of design activities,

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.500
let's say, was not appropriate.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.000
And even if we introduced five-year

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.820
quality and so on, this approach

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.180
was characterized by the concepts

01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:31.600
of "import" or "foreign"

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.240
and "our domestic".

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:39.180
These terms were synonymous with

01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.860
what we are talking about a quality

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.440
product or not very quality,

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.900
unfortunately.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.380
The next method of planning, so-

01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.160
called planning from the

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.480
mastered volume.

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.600
This method is based on the fact that

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:06.200
we clearly see the amount we have mastered.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.540
And then, knowing what amount we

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:12.100
have mastered, we begin to plan either

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.460
completely extrapolating the situation,

01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.540
or still making adjustments in such

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:20.100
a way that we can continue to perform

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:25.860
the project and the project performance,

01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.600
completion of the project

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.520
within the planned indicators.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.940
The Perd method.

01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:40.300
We will stop at it in more detail now.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.540
The next method

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.500
is calendar network planning

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.180
or Gantt chart.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.960
We looked at an example of

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.640
a representation of structural

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.360
decomposition of work in the Microsoft

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.420
Project tool.

01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:01.500
Here, on the next slide, we

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.660
have a fragment of the Gantt

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.260
chart in the same tool.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.740
That is, we see that here on the left is

01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.920
a part of the structural decomposition

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.920
of the works, and on the right is

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:20.300
a calendar-network chart, which is depicted

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.880
in the form of a chart, giving

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.600
the name of Gantt.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.540
This is the same Henry Gunt, who is

01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:33.300
one of the founders of Western

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:35.640
methods of project management

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:38.940
by swapers and we talked about at

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:42.420
the beginning of this course.

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:47.760
This type of presentation of works related

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:52.900
to the time scale, with the calendar,

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:56.060
with the composition of the works, it

01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:01.920
is very convenient, very compact and visible.

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:08.700
I think Gante did

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.200
very well.

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.300
In fact, one can say, to embrace

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.920
immense.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.180
On the one hand, it is possible to present the

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.720
calendar and network schedule very

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.180
carefully and clearly, and on the other

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.860
hand, the composition of the works, the

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.280
structural decomposition of the works.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.620
Moreover, we can parallelly extract

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.380
the data and information

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:35.140
we need, and this already

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:40.440
represents different project

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.200
management tools.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.960
The last method you see is

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.840
going back to the previous

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.980
slide again, it's a method

01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:56.020
of planning from the end result.

01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:58.780
We touched it in part when we considered

01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:01.740
the reverse passage method

01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:05.100
when considering the network model.

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:10.180
In general, a very interesting method

01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:15.700
and the very fact that we take and

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:18.700
put ourselves in the end result,

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.200
the end product, it can already

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.520
clarify many questions and problems.

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.300


01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.280
That is, we model the situation in

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.880
such a way that we move ourselves to

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.000
the point of the final outcome of the

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.500
project and thus have the opportunity

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.700
to consider the project from a

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.600
completely different side.

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.480
Thus we can consider the

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.980
end product or result in

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:50.840
such a way that we see what basic

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.240
conditions we need to make

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.140
the product, the end result,

01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:00.180
viable, self-aligned and

01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:06.580
self-developing or it can

01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:09.660
be successfully exploited.

01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.980
It is here that considering the

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.260
project from all sides, including

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.960
the end product or outcome,

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.860
allows us to consider more

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:27.300
factors affecting the project.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.280
Pert is the method of Program

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.540
Evaluation and Review

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:36.740
Technique.

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:40.220
This method is also called a probability

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.700
method and is used when

01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.680
we have a lot of uncertainty

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.600
in the project and

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.260
a significant part of the parameters

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.440
we can estimate only

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.940
based on probability

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.640
estimates.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:00.940
Many of our PERT assessments

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:05.020
are default and we

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:08.000
use this method in

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.440
much of our planning

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.340
work, including

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:18.080
time planning.

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:22.860
And it consists in the fact that we

01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:27.070
assess the most optimal conditions

01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:30.250
for the implementation of the project,

01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:32.990
consider, for example, the timing parameters

01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:36.270
in the case of the optimal outcome of

01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:40.330
the situation and the optimal performance

01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:42.130
of work and tasks.

01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:45.850
Next, we look at the most unsuccessful

01:50:45.850 --> 01:50:50.150
or worst options for the implementation

01:50:50.150 --> 01:50:53.370
of a project, task or work,

01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:57.770
summarize the time for the worst

01:50:57.770 --> 01:51:01.270
option and compare this time

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:03.290
with the time we get for the

01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:04.750
best option.

01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:09.010
There are several estimates, for

01:51:09.010 --> 01:51:12.110
example, the duration of the project

01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:14.790
by the PERT method, for example,

01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:17.330
one of the most common estimates

01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:20.950
is when we take and assign

01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:24.730
the value of the duration parameter,

01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:27.250
a time parameter, which we can

01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:30.250
calculate based on the best

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:34.110
conditions, optimal conditions.

01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:37.870
We attribute this value to

01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.890
the unit weight factor.

01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:43.070
Next, we attribute the unit

01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:44.130
weighting to the

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:47.190
pessimistic implementation,

01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:52.370
and the largest weighting,

01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:55.410
say, 4, we attribute to

01:51:55.410 --> 01:51:57.950
the most probability estimate

01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:00.770
of duration.

01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:04.750
Thus, we sum up all three estimates,

01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:07.450
that is, the optimistic estimate,

01:52:07.450 --> 01:52:09.150
the pessimistic and most

01:52:09.150 --> 01:52:12.010
likely with the sum of the

01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:15.090
weighting factors 6 and then

01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:18.550
divide for normalization by 6,

01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:22.170
as shown in this slide.

01:52:23.650 --> 01:52:26.910
This is a typical situation that is being

01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:30.450
implemented in Western Europe and in

01:52:30.450 --> 01:52:32.490
Western business.

01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:35.630
In Russia, if we analyze

01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:39.830
the projects carried out and compile

01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:42.030
statistics on the projects

01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:44.810
carried out, then practice, experience

01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:46.970
shows that the weighting factor,

01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:49.770
for example, in the

01:52:49.770 --> 01:52:52.150
pessimistic assessment is long.

01:52:52.410 --> 01:52:54.090
In this situation, we still have

01:52:54.090 --> 01:52:56.490
better to take not one, but a pair

01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:59.450
and then normalize not at 6, but

01:52:59.450 --> 01:53:00.830
at 7.

01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:04.830
If we work with the use, say, of the

01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:06.870
Microsoft Project tool, then when

01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:09.450
you enter this tool there is a sub-

01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:12.870
part in one of the menus, where

01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:15.450
we are asked for the coefficients,

01:53:15.450 --> 01:53:18.350
the weighting coefficients

01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:20.670
of the PERT method.

01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:24.030
By default, they are used there

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:25.670
in the exact sequence as presented

01:53:25.890 --> 01:53:28.510
here on the slide.

01:53:28.890 --> 01:53:30.190
1 to 4.
