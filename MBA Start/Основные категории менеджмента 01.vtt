00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Good afternoon, dear colleagues. I am Oleg Boksansky, Professor of the Russian Economic Academy named after Georgy Plokhanov.

00:13.000 --> 00:25.000
I teach MBA courses in general management, management of organizations, management of human resources, and I am a consultant in the field of HR consulting.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.000
The topic of our meeting is management. We will discuss the main categories and approaches that exist in modern management,

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
and also, in conclusion, we will focus on the trends of development that are present in the 21st century of management applicants.

00:44.000 --> 00:57.000
When we start talking about management, this topic has a long history, and in fact, all business success, all commercial success,

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
are associated with successful organization of the process itself, with successful organization of the management process to achieve the goals that are before the company.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
Our task within this topic is, firstly, to get acquainted with the history of the emergence of management as a scientific discipline,

01:16.000 --> 01:30.000
secondly, to clarify the main concepts that are applied today, that have proven their effectiveness, that have proven their success, and that really give results.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And the third task, as we have already said, will be to get acquainted with the prospects of management.

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
Management does not stand still, it constantly develops, constantly changes, because it is forced to respond to the needs and requests of the external environment that are presented to it.

01:45.000 --> 01:58.000
And that is why only those who achieve success in business, who react very subtly and with caution to the problems that arise in the market,

01:58.000 --> 02:11.000
and who are able to foresee the methods of impact, the results, the management approaches that will prove their effectiveness, not now, but tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
This is the success of the achievements of those businessmen who have achieved outstanding results.

02:18.000 --> 02:30.000
When we talk about management, the first question that arises is related to the definition. What will we understand about management?

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
This is a rather difficult question, because it can be approached from two points of view.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
The first point of view is to give some academic definition.

02:44.000 --> 02:58.000
We can open a large number of textbooks, and textbooks written by famous authors, who have undisputed and undisputed authority in this field,

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
and see that each of these authors gives, albeit similar, but in some way different definition of management,

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
and makes emphasis on different directions and approaches.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
Let's focus on the practically significant, practically applicable, practically verifiable definition of management.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
And then, when we will consider the formation of management, different theoretical approaches that are implemented in management,

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
different achievements that are in management, then, accordingly, we will fill this definition with a specific meaning,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
in order not to indulge in any other academic nuances.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
Let's, within the framework of our meeting today, within the framework of considering the material of the topic,

03:48.000 --> 03:58.000
within the framework of considering the material of the course, we will consider management as a management of social-economic and social-technical systems,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
which has as its goal to obtain a specific result.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
What is important to pay attention to in this definition?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
First of all, it is about systems.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Modern management is a kind of system organization.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
There are no autonomous elements, no separate independent parts, independent blocks,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
which we can put together and get a certain management structure.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Management is a system.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
This is the first and fundamental basis on which we should pay attention.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Next.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
As for management, this management is primarily carried out by people,

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
it encompasses people, and, accordingly, all management has a social structure, a social basis.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Naturally, this social basis is primarily economic.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
We are talking about business, we are talking about commerce, we are talking about economic relations that arise in this process.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
But, in addition to these economic achievements, we are also talking about technical achievements.

05:05.000 --> 05:14.000
If we are talking about production, then, accordingly, we should consider the problem of technical devices,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
machines, machines on which telecommerce products are produced.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
If we are talking about services, then these services are also based on different technical achievements.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
Therefore, we will highlight in management both social-economic relations and social-technical relations.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
These are all the relations that exist in society.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
These are all the relations that have their own hierarchy, their own pattern.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
These are all the relations that are realized by people, between people, and which are realized in the process of our social interaction.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
But, again, we are talking about management from a practical point of view.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
We need to acquire the skills of applying these or other concepts of management,

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
these or other management approaches, so that we can implement them in our everyday business activities.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Our business activity is always oriented towards the result.

06:11.000 --> 06:20.000
We can build plans, we can build prospects, but these will be plans and prospects for achieving a specific final result.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
There is no business for the sake of a strategy, there is no business for the sake of some distant, clouded goals.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
These are some ideological moments, and this is what not businessmen do, but what politicians do.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
Every business is focused on the result, because the result is essentially the achievement that we have achieved.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
And then, when we bring this result to the market, then the position that is occupied by this market,

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
the segmentation of the market that is taking place, the income that we receive,

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
they testify whether we have achieved a profitable result, or even the most wonderful management,

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
the most wonderful managerial relations and the wonderful psychological climate in the team,

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
turned out to be ineffective, because the result that we have achieved is not in demand.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Accordingly, the result is the important third feature that we will have in mind in management.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So, the first thing is that management is always a system.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
The second thing is that management always has a social value, because it is associated with the relationships of people.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
Moreover, these are economic and technical relations, like the material basis on which management is implemented.

07:42.000 --> 07:53.000
And the third thing is the result. Only management, only those approaches in management that implement all these three features,

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
turn out to be productive. In fact, these are the three basic, main points that we need to know,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
we need to remember when we make any management decision.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
If we do not pay attention to any of these three aspects, or we miss attention to this point,

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
we level it, then, unfortunately, it will lead not to the results that we want.

08:22.000 --> 08:32.000
As you understand, I do not stop at this for a long time, because I would like us to come to the conclusion

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
that management is a certain professional activity.

08:36.000 --> 08:46.000
Management is not the result of common sense, it is not what is given by God, what a person shows.

08:46.000 --> 08:56.000
Management is a daily, long-term work, and it is the professional activity that is expensive.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
Moreover, it is a professional activity, it concerns management of all processes built into organizations.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
And, what is also very important to pay attention to, business is always the situation that is realized in the conditions of risk and uncertainty.

09:14.000 --> 09:23.000
Unfortunately, or fortunately, we never know for sure what results we will get,

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
and how much those plans that we have set for ourselves, how much those business plans that we have written down for ourselves will be realized.

09:31.000 --> 09:41.000
In the end, it is very difficult to take into account all that huge set of relations that is around the business.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
And very often we have to take risks, it is twofold.

09:45.000 --> 09:55.000
Either our risk is justified and we make a leap, and, in principle, what concerns the undisputed business achievements,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
it has always been a certain risk.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
This is the risk that Henry Ford had, this is the risk that Bill Gates had, this is the risk that Fayol had,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
what we will talk about today.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And when they began to deal with their own questions, each with their own topic,

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
and each of them did not know who we would study after 100 years, and who we would forget and not even remember.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
At the same time, in addition to the risk, there is a significant element of uncertainty.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Again, if we put new goods on the market, if we try to build a new service,

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
it is not always clear how much it will be in demand.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
We can make the most wonderful product, but it will not be in demand,

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
because either the advertising will be poorly done, or the psychology of the consumer will not be taken into account.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
This is a very important point that we will also talk about and which the manager and management specialist should also consider.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
So, all this situation is associated with uncertainty.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
This is a situation where either we are on a horse, or we need to start all over again,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
and the funds that we have invested may not be repaid.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
I think I do not need to talk about this in more detail for you, people who do business every day.

11:21.000 --> 11:29.000
At the same time, in order to function normally in a situation of risk and uncertainty,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
the manager must have some freedom.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
Here, an administrative approach is not allowed, when you have a plan and you have to do exactly as it is written.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
It is not allowed because the documents are written once and for all.

11:48.000 --> 11:57.000
They reflect some of the conditions that were before, but these documents do not reflect the changes that are now.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Accordingly, if we work on the basis of the past, we remain in the past.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Only those who achieve success in business, only those who are successful managers,

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
who react very subtly and subtly to the everyday changes that are happening,

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
and for this you need a certain freedom in making both strategic and tactical decisions.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
Because it determines the direction in which economic investment will be made,

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
the direction in which a particular production system will be built,

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
a particular operating system, where certain or other prospects will be determined.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And the manager must take all this into account, he must understand all this,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
and accordingly he is given a certain degree of freedom,

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
but for this degree of freedom he must pay for the achievement of the end results.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
It is all these circumstances that show that a manager must represent himself and represents himself

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
in the whole civilized world a professional sphere of activity,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
which must be studied for a long time, first of all, at the university,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
getting basic knowledge of theory, but the main thing is that all achievements,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
all success of a manager is associated with our specific experience.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
We can all read the same books, but we will all apply them in different ways,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and we will all get different results.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
This is the most expensive thing that is called experience,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
which is the essential basis of professionalism.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
We have now determined the understanding of management,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
which will be present in our presentation today.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
Let's now focus on the main functions of management.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
We have considered its main characteristics, its tasks,

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
the conditions in which it is implemented, the conditions of risk, management,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
the conditions of freedom of choice, tactical and strategic decisions

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
for achieving the desired result.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Let's now move on to the functional consideration of management,

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
because management is, first of all, a system of relations,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
and this system has some functions.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
There is no management at all.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Management should always be specific.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
As for the function of management, different authors highlight different functions.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Again, this is natural, we have discussed this with you.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
But from a pragmatic point of view, from the point of view of our daily business tasks,

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
which we must solve from the point of view of organizing any business processes,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
we can highlight four main functions of management.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
In fact, these are the functions that are highlighted by different authors.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
They can be called differently, they can be given in different order.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
This is not so important, because we need to consider the functional tasks

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
and each of them, depending on the tasks that are in front of it,

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
depending on the conditions on the market that exist,

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
will highlight those or other functions from the point of view of their priorities,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
from the point of view of their importance.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
The question is that management should include all these four functions.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Just at every specific moment, in every specific situation,

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
each of these functions can have a more important meaning.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Another meaning can wait, not cancel, not disappear,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
but simply reorient itself from the point of view of their priorities.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
As for the function of management, as we have already discussed,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
planning is of great importance.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Management is a system of management relationships that arise between people

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
that are oriented to the production that exists.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Therefore, management is associated with planning of activities.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
I have to organize the planning of people's busyness.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I have to organize the planning of the busyness of production.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
I have to organize the planning of providing the implementation of a particular service.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Accordingly, when we talk about planning,

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
it is the tactical, close and strategic long-term goals that we set for ourselves.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Because depending on the goals, the plans, the tasks I set for myself,

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
I will have a further management system.

16:43.000 --> 16:51.000
Therefore, planning is a certain perspective that I need to achieve

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
and the steps of achieving this perspective.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
These are not just plans that I will set.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
This is not a certain result that I have previously developed,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
for example, a state plan for a five-year, ten-year or something else.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
Planning is the desired result and the ways, methods, steps, operations to achieve it.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
It is very important that the result does not detract from practice.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
You can set the most remarkable result,

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
doubling of the internal product, triple, and so on,

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
but until specific ways of this achievement are prescribed,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and the ways that are implemented,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
again, not some ideal schemes that can be read in any textbook,

17:37.000 --> 17:46.000
but really those methods that are able to be achieved.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
So, planning.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
After we have planned the activity,

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
planned certain perspectives, certain approaches, certain tasks,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
the stage of organization comes,

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
the organization of achieving these plans.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
The plan only then matters,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
I have already emphasized and I will emphasize it again,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
because for business it is a fundamental approach.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
The plan only then matters when there are ways of its achievement.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
But after these ways are prescribed,

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
it is necessary to organize their material achievements, their implementation.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
The plan can be the most remarkable,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
the ways of its achievement can also be remarkably prescribed,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
but its execution, the execution of the plan,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
the achievement of the results is carried out by people.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
The achievement of the results should always be tied to people,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
both to the manufacturers and to the suppliers,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
and in the end to those who will use these results,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
that is, for whom this whole business scheme is completed.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
As for the organization, the execution of the results,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
organizational management,

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
perhaps this is one of the most difficult tasks of management,

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
because this is the practice of achieving results.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
This is direct work with people,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
this is a direct organization of production,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
this is a direct conclusion,

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
the exit to the market of those or other results that were obtained.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
We will talk about this more than once.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
The next function of management is, of course, the function of motivation.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
We work with people, this is the original idea that should be constantly kept in mind.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
We do not work with money, not with machines,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
we work with people, with their desires, needs, abilities,

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
with their desire to get something, with their laziness, with their ambitions.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
We work with real people,

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
and these people need to be motivated to solve the tasks that we have set for them,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
that we have planned for them, that we have organized for their execution.

20:18.000 --> 20:26.000
And it is necessary to achieve that people are motivated to achieve the results

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
that are ahead of them.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
They sabotaged them, they tried to get rid of them, they worked with a cold.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
I think that the problem of motivation is something that everyone is well aware of.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
How to motivate a person?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Is one salary enough?

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Or do you need some additional results?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Bonuses, payment of loans, medical care.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Is material stimulation enough?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Or do we need non-material stimulation?

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
All of this is also a significant function of management,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
because a successful management result,

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
a successful system of building relationships in an organization,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is determined by motivation.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
A well-organized motivation allows you to get long-term results.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
A well-organized motivation allows you to avoid current frameworks.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
A well-organized motivation allows you to achieve a re-execution of plans

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
and, accordingly, to get more and more results,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
which will strengthen the position of the company in the market,

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
to help promote its brand and to get the desired results for the company.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
And, of course, when we talk about management functions,

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
we should pay attention to its function as a control.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
Indeed, we can build wonderful plans with all the conditions we talked about.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
We can organize the whole system of execution of these plans.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
We can build a great motivation system.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
But we need to control all these actions, all these results.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Do they lead us to the final result we want to achieve?

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Because we can get a lot of intermediate results.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
A good motivation can lead to the growth of loyalty of the company employees,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
to the division of their missions in the company.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
They will not formally carry out their duties,

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
but the results that will be obtained in the end

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
will differ from the initial tasks that were before us.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
Somewhere there was a failure or a deviation.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
And we need a constant feedback at every stage.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
At the stage of planning, at the stage of organization, at the stage of motivation.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
We must constantly control the current results

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
with the final results that we have determined for ourselves,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
which we have set as the organizers of the production,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
as managers, as the owners of a particular business.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
And as for the control, this is also a very delicate point.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
There are different forms of control, which we will talk about in a moment.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
And this control should not be something like a supervisor.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
As for the control, we are not only talking about tracking the implementation of the tasks,

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
but also about identifying mistakes, identifying difficulties that arise along the way,

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
analyzing these difficulties and, accordingly, correcting them.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
In this case, the control receives a wide field of distribution,

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
which is not only related to tracking the accuracy of the result,

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
but also to modification, adaptation of this result,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
adding of certain resources.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Because we work in a situation of risk, in a situation of uncertainty.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
And, accordingly, we do not always know what difficulties we have encountered.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
If we encounter difficulties, then control is needed

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
so that we can solve this difficulty, level it, disavow it as early as possible,

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
until it leads to a stop of production,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
when it leads to the failure of the brand on the market, and so on.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Control should not be all-encompassing and constant.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Control should be optimal, it should be productive,

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
it should be progressive from the point of view that it is aimed at achieving

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
the ultimate goal that is before any management.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
Achieving the result that was set, for which the business is organized,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
for which efforts are made, funds are invested,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
for which people working in this industry are working.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
So, these are the main management functions,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
which are traditionally highlighted in it.

25:26.000 --> 25:37.000
And usually, few practitioners will argue with these functions.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
As for the theorists, they also agree with these functions.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
Just as I have already noted, different nuances, different aspects are highlighted in different functions.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
This, however, depends on the specific production, on the specific tasks that we face.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
So, this is what concerns the basic management positions,

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
how we will consider them, and the functions that we will face in management.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
The next task that is before us is a task related to getting acquainted

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
with the main approaches that are implemented in management.

26:20.000 --> 26:31.000
As for these approaches, they have been proposed a lot in the 200-year history of management development.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
But we will focus on those that have proven their effectiveness,

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
their ability to organize and manage production,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
and which are used now, among other things.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
These are the approaches that are effective.

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
The main approaches that were proposed in management in the 21st century are presented on this table,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
which you can see on the slide.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
And, accordingly, we will focus on these approaches.

27:07.000 --> 27:17.000
As for management thinking, it covers the period from the end of the 19th century to the end of the 20th century,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
to the beginning of the 21st century.

27:19.000 --> 27:28.000
And we can see that each of the proposed approaches takes a certain period of time.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
Please note that these periods of time are decades, not a year or two months.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
These are decades, sometimes even half a century,

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
during which certain or other positions are tested, which are typical of each approach.

27:48.000 --> 27:57.000
Let's now go through this table and see how these approaches are interconnected,

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
how each of these approaches is a certain starting point for the next approach.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Why do these approaches arise one after another?

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
They are mostly in a sequence, because first there is a certain approach.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
It has some positive results, and it begins to be implemented, it begins to be used.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
But as it is implemented, as it is used, its limitations are revealed.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
On the one hand, new socio-economic conditions arise.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Remember the definition of management that we gave.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Different socio-technical conditions arise.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Again, let's remember, we give the definition of management.

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
Systemic relations that exist between people, that exist between manufacturers, change.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
And, accordingly, the need for the final result that we want to achieve changes.

28:57.000 --> 29:08.000
Accordingly, those or other achievements that were achieved in management should be modified, modernized, and adapted.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
No matter how good they are, management is a fundamentally dynamic system.

29:15.000 --> 29:26.000
If management becomes static, it is doomed, because all processes are constantly changing.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
And there is no need to look for these decisions once and for all.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
Unfortunately, they do not exist.

29:34.000 --> 29:44.000
Or, let's be more careful, in any case, there are still no unambiguous, just approaches in all times and for all circumstances.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
Well, maybe they will not be found further, then we will consider and study them.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
So, let's now consider these approaches that are presented here.

29:56.000 --> 30:05.000
The emergence of management as a scientific discipline is connected with the name of Frederick Winslow Taylor.

30:05.000 --> 30:17.000
And as for Taylor, he was actually the founder of management as a kind of professional activity.

30:17.000 --> 30:26.000
Again, remember when we talked about, gave a definition of management, we emphasized that management is primarily a professional activity.

30:26.000 --> 30:38.000
So, the first person who paid attention to this, the first person who made management a profession, was Taylor.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
Taylor lived in the 19th century, the main part of his life took place in the 19th century.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
He was born in 1856, died in 1915.

30:47.000 --> 31:01.000
And this time was characterized by the development of industry, the emergence and establishment of capitalist economic relations.

31:02.000 --> 31:13.000
And therefore, the task arose, the need arose to analyze, to structure those new economic relations that arise.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
To a significant extent, this was done by economists.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
But as for Taylor, he was again a practitioner.

31:21.000 --> 31:33.000
And it was Taylor who drew attention to the fact that to a significant extent, if we want to get a specific result in production, in service,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
then in a certain way it is necessary to organize the working conditions.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
There are different factories, and Taylor, of course, saw it all.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
These factories can have the same equipment, the same number of people can work at these factories.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
But the result at the output of each of these factories is different.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Why?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The machines are the same.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
Well, people are different, of course, but on the other hand, these are people who work on machines.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
The number of factory indicators is the same, the result is different.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Why?

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
It is quite possible that this situation is due to the fact that it is necessary to look for a problem in people.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
The machines are the same, people are different.

32:21.000 --> 32:32.000
But as for Taylor, he did not consider the problem of motivation of specific people.

32:32.000 --> 32:42.000
He drew attention to the fact that a lot, from the point of view of business, from the point of view of the final result,

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
determines how management is organized by these people.

32:47.000 --> 32:56.000
How well they know what to do, when to do it, under what conditions to do it, in what order to do it,

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
depending on how their working day is organized, how many breaks they have, when they have a lunch break,

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
how the interaction between these people is organized, how the management of these people is organized.

33:10.000 --> 33:25.000
Based on his observations, Taylor realized that the final economic results that will be obtained depend on the administration.

33:25.000 --> 33:33.000
It is the administration, because the administration in the 19th century was engaged in management.

33:33.000 --> 33:40.000
It was the administration in the 19th century, the administration of factories, that decided the main functions that stood before it.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
The function of planning, the function of organization, the function of motivation and the function of control.

33:45.000 --> 33:52.000
Depending on how this or that function is implemented, how the corresponding tasks are solved,

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
which are in front of the managers, different results are obtained.

33:57.000 --> 34:10.000
Taylor decided that if we can find the patterns of the management,

34:10.000 --> 34:18.000
then these patterns significantly determine the final results that we strive for.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
In this regard, Taylor proposed the concept of scientific management.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
The fact is that what concerns the 19th century, in the 19th century there was a development of science,

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
and therefore science emphasized the truthfulness, the resultiveness of the approach.

34:38.000 --> 34:47.000
From this point of view, Taylor introduced and formulated the system of organization of scientific management,

34:47.000 --> 34:54.000
or what became very well known as the scientific organization of labor.

34:54.000 --> 35:02.000
It is related to the name of Taylor, he introduced these positions in the 19th century.

35:03.000 --> 35:18.000
As for this approach, Taylor assumes that it is the administration that takes on the task of developing the scientific foundation of management.

35:18.000 --> 35:28.000
I, as the owner, will decide how the organization of labor interaction will be built,

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
how the interaction with the manufacturers will be built, how the interaction with suppliers will be built.

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
Moreover, if I want to get a result that suits me, I must base it on some scientific principles.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
The scientific principles of those that Taylor proposes in his research.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
As for Taylor, he left the practice.

35:49.000 --> 35:59.000
His achievements, his work was related to the fact that he observed the activities of workers,

35:59.000 --> 36:09.000
the activities of the leaders of these workers, and, accordingly, he identified those approaches, those methods,

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
those actions that led to the desired results, and those actions that hindered the achievement of the result,

36:15.000 --> 36:26.000
that led to disorganization of production, that led to various difficulties and failure of certain plans.

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
Taylor was based on these scientifically established facts,

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
the facts that science has highlighted, science of the 19th century,

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
and, in fact, the facts that Taylor called the scientific organization of labor.

36:45.000 --> 36:57.000
So, if the administration selects workers for production, for those or other machines, based on these scientific results,

36:57.000 --> 37:05.000
it will contribute to the achievement of the final result, for which the production is carried out.

37:05.000 --> 37:12.000
In the end, the owner invests money to get the desired return, to get profit,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
and, accordingly, to have the opportunity to expand the production to get even more profit.

37:17.000 --> 37:24.000
But it was Taylor who drew attention to the fact that it is not enough for us to simply select workers.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
It is not enough to select those who will work on machines.

37:30.000 --> 37:39.000
It is necessary to organize the training of these workers, first, and, secondly, to develop the abilities that each worker has.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
On a machine, you can work at different speeds.

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
In the end, you can adapt to work on this machine in such a way to get more results,

37:50.000 --> 37:57.000
to get rid of trauma, to get rid of all sorts of difficulties that arise.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
To organize what today was called the safety technique.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
It also refers to Taylor, who drew attention to this.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
If our management system, our production management system,

38:10.000 --> 38:16.000
is organized in terms of adequate selection of employees,

38:16.000 --> 38:28.000
who will later be trained, and we train them, and develop them in terms of working in certain conditions,

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
then we can be sure that we will not just get the desired result,

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
but this result will even exceed our expectations.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Taylor in the 19th century. This is very important.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Today, many of Taylor's ideas, which I am talking about now, are obvious.

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
They are already being studied in management from the very beginning.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
They are already given as the most obvious things, because otherwise it cannot be so.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
But this is today. Taylor received his results in the 19th century,

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
when there was a completely different attitude to production and to the tasks that were faced,

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
when capitalist and economic relations were only affirmed.

39:18.000 --> 39:25.000
So, from Taylor's point of view, if the administration, management,

39:25.000 --> 39:33.000
performs trustworthy cooperation with the workers in the direction of achieving certain goals,

39:33.000 --> 39:43.000
then we will get even better results.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
In this case, the task is to motivate the workers to work.

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
Again, remember the management functions that we talked about.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
In fact, it is Taylor who pays attention to the need for motivation.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
But perhaps he was the first to bring all this into the system,

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
because it is not for nothing that the scientific management begins with him.

40:11.000 --> 40:27.000
Finally, Taylor draws attention to the need to distribute responsibility between management and workers.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
Everyone is responsible for their own sector of activity.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
The workers are engaged in the performance of production, they produce something.

40:37.000 --> 40:45.000
And the administration is engaged in the management.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
But all this is very interconnected.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
It is pointless to lead by an unknown name and to perform something against the guidance.

40:57.000 --> 41:05.000
Only if the workers and the managers move in the same direction,

41:05.000 --> 41:12.000
if the executive and management functions of the workers and the responsibility of each of them for their own sector are distributed between them,

41:12.000 --> 41:19.000
only in this case, under these conditions, we can get the desired result.

41:19.000 --> 41:26.000
Let's say, Taylor's achievements were his achievements.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
And that is why Taylor is considered the father of scientific management.

41:31.000 --> 41:38.000
They all had practical applications and gave fast practical results.

41:38.000 --> 41:46.000
As for the 19th century, during this period of rapid industrial development,

41:46.000 --> 41:56.000
some phenomena arose that did not please the owners of enterprises.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
One of these phenomena is restrictionism.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
That is, working with a coolant.

42:02.000 --> 42:12.000
The worker comes and starts working at the machine, getting some results, but he does not show activity.

42:12.000 --> 42:25.000
He is on duty, and, accordingly, he has no initiative to work better,

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
to do what was called a rationalization proposal,

42:29.000 --> 42:38.000
to use all the potential opportunities that a particular machine gives him.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
Again, pay attention to the fact that this is the 19th century.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Machines are just emerging, they are modernizing,

42:45.000 --> 42:55.000
and, accordingly, there are no standards or prospects of this or that activity.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And what does the worker want?

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
The worker, of course, wants to be less busy, to get more.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
And that is why Taylor comes from the fact that this is the cause of restrictionism.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
In order to get rid of it, we must motivate the workers,

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
we must organize planning correctly,

43:19.000 --> 43:26.000
and we must control every step of the implementation of this or that activity.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
So far, every step is a stop of management.

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
Flexibility is the next stage of its development, which we will talk about later.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
As for Taylor, he not only explained the phenomenon of restrictionism,

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
but also proposed ways to eliminate it, to overcome it, which worked.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
At those enterprises, at those factories where Taylor's scientific organization was implemented,

43:52.000 --> 44:01.000
the results were more than remarkable compared to other factories.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.000
As for Taylor, he also proposed a system of organizational measures,

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
which was aimed at improving the results, improving the production.

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
He introduced chronometry, which is a time measurement necessary for each operation.

44:22.000 --> 44:30.000
Taylor was the person who proposed to divide the process of work on the machine

44:30.000 --> 44:40.000
into specific operational stages, to measure the time that the worker spends on each operation,

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
and then to see which of these operations slows down the final activity,

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
where the worker needs assistants, where something needs to be changed,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
where some changes in the machine itself can be made.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
This chronometry, or what is now called a work time photo,

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
is all that was proposed by Taylor.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
Taylor also proposed to introduce instruction cards,

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
that is, in fact, what is now called a safety technique.

45:10.000 --> 45:24.000
You come to work, and the first thing you are given is a list of actions that you must perform,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
that you must not perform.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
In fact, these are instructions that ensure, on the one hand,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
the preservation of your life and health, as a safety technique,

45:36.000 --> 45:44.000
and on the other hand, the preservation of equipment and the increase of the results of production,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
in terms of production, in terms of the supply of services.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
Taylor proposed to create so-called planning offices,

45:55.000 --> 46:02.000
which would plan the work of people on certain technical means.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
It would be easier to work on some machines,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
because there are simpler operations,

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
and some machines are associated with more complex tasks, with greater complexity.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
So what happened very often?

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
A huge number of blanks accumulated after some machines,

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
which the workers, in other words, simply did not have time to process.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
It was the planning offices that were recognized in order to match the number of machines.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
If, for example, one machine gives 100 blanks in an hour,

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
and the second machine, processing this blank after the first machine,

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
is able to process only 50 parts in an hour,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
let's put two machines.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
And accordingly, then two machines will be able to work with the same 100 parts.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
There will be no stoppage of the previous machines.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
These are all the tasks that were solved by the planning office.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
And in fact, today it all exists as a matter of course.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
But at the time when Taylor proposed it, when Taylor implemented it,

47:06.000 --> 47:14.000
these were the methods that contributed to the colossal rise of the results

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
that were at those factories.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
So, this is what concerns scientific management or the formation of management.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
This is what concerns Taylor's contribution.

47:27.000 --> 47:34.000
And in fact, he is considered the father of modern management.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
Because almost all the ideas that we talked about today,

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
are what are used now.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
This is what is already perceived without a doubt.

47:46.000 --> 47:54.000
At the time, 100 years ago, Taylor had to make a lot of effort

47:54.000 --> 48:04.000
to prove to the owners of those or other factories the need for these changes.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.000
After all, all this at one time was a serious investment in additional production.

48:11.000 --> 48:22.000
Naturally, the capitalist is interested in investing only if he is confident in the return.

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
What Taylor proposed, in fact, were many points related to the work with the staff.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
At that time, in the 19th century, working with the staff was not yet something significant.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
And it was believed that the main thing was technical support.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
We will always find people.

48:43.000 --> 48:51.000
In fact, it was Taylor who made the first impact on this idea.

48:51.000 --> 49:00.000
He can also be considered the founder of various concepts of management and human resources.

49:01.000 --> 49:10.000
The implementation of Taylor's scientific management ideas took 30-40 years.

49:10.000 --> 49:16.000
Gradually, they were introduced into production.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
Gradually, they began to dominate both in Europe and in America.

49:23.000 --> 49:32.000
But at the same time, it became obvious that the results Taylor got in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
were not quite adequate.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
After all, they required an update in the early 20th century.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
Because the administration itself changed, the production itself changed,

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
the people who work in the production changed, the social-economic relations changed,

49:59.000 --> 50:06.000
the social-technical systems that exist changed,

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
the requirements for the specific results that were obtained changed.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.000
And the need for an expansion of the concept of management,

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
further development of Taylor's ideas, not to abandon them.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
These are very important aspects that I have already addressed and again draw your attention to.

50:28.000 --> 50:36.000
Not to abandon Taylor's ideas, that is, time has passed, they have worked out their own, now they need to be replaced.

50:36.000 --> 50:43.000
Not to replace, but to add those or other concepts, to modernize those or other approaches,

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
to change the terminology, to change the requirements, to change the tasks, to change the conditions.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
And this was implemented in the classical school of management.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
As for Taylor, it is a school of scientific management,

50:59.000 --> 51:09.000
because he set the task of achieving a scientific justification for the concept of management.

51:09.000 --> 51:18.000
Now, after he set this task and decided, and scientific management was introduced into production,

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
the next school emerged, or the school of classical management.

51:25.000 --> 51:36.000
Classical, because this school emerged at the stage of a fairly widely developed capitalist production,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
capitalist economic relations.

51:38.000 --> 51:48.000
And, accordingly, those ideas, those approaches, those principles that were laid down in the classical school,

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
that were based on Taylor's scientific management,

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
are the foundations on which any system of existing management is built today.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
This is a classic in the sense that it is an idea that justified itself and its approach.

52:04.000 --> 52:12.000
The development of the classical school was associated with different names,

52:12.000 --> 52:20.000
but both the scientific management associated with Taylor and the classical school associated with Foyol,

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
who developed the classical principles of management.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Or the principles of classical management.

52:28.000 --> 52:36.000
This is what is written in any textbook today, and in almost every book that is offered to you in the list of literature,

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
you will come across both Taylor and Foyol, and the principles that are laid down there.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
Again, as for Foyol, he highlighted many principles.

52:47.000 --> 53:01.000
In our discussion and analysis today, we will focus on those principles that are as relevant today,

53:01.000 --> 53:11.000
or even more relevant than they were 100 years ago, when Foyol highlighted them, considered them, justified them, and implemented them.

53:11.000 --> 53:25.000
As for the classical principles of management, Foyol is associated with the idea of division of labor.

53:26.000 --> 53:38.000
We should not strive for working universals that can do any operation, any detail.

53:38.000 --> 53:51.000
As the growth of production, as the growth of other production activities is getting more and more complicated,

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
we need what is called narrow professionalism.

53:58.000 --> 54:07.000
We need division of labor in such a way that certain operations are performed professionally.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
This idea was proposed and considered by Foyol, and it was implemented.

54:13.000 --> 54:20.000
This is why the emphasis was placed on the idea of universality, so that each worker could replace another.

54:20.000 --> 54:29.000
Foyol noticed that this is good, but in the end it turns out that we can replace another,

54:29.000 --> 54:41.000
but this is achieved by losing certain qualities, certain speed, certain time in each production site.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
If we divide all production into component parts, into component operations,

54:47.000 --> 54:55.000
and we orient workers to professional mastering of narrow sites,

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
then in the end, when the composition of certain parts takes place,

54:59.000 --> 55:07.000
we will get a much better quality result, which will have a higher value.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
The next principle of management, which Foyol highlights, concerns power and responsibility.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
In this case, power is understood as control.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
Again, let's recall the management functions that we discussed.

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
But it was Foyol who noticed that the management power,

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
that is, the control function of management, implies responsibility.

55:31.000 --> 55:38.000
Because there is a goal of an activity, there is a path to its achievement.

55:38.000 --> 55:45.000
The task of a manager is to control the movement to this goal,

55:45.000 --> 55:51.000
but it cannot be controlled formally, in general terms.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
If I control a certain process,

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
then I take responsibility for the fact that the organization of this process

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
should give the intermediate results, which will eventually lead to the final result.

56:08.000 --> 56:14.000
Again, today this is an obvious thing, but in the days of Foyol,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
it was precisely the power that was discussed as control.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
And the manager should not be responsible, he should simply control.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
And what are the results of this control?

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
What are the results of the management decisions that are made?

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
This is what he did not pay attention to.

56:34.000 --> 56:40.000
But Foyol concluded that power should not be for the sake of power.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
I am a manager, and therefore I manage.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
But power should be for the sake of the final result,

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
for the sake of the intermediate result, to achieve the final result.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
And accordingly, the manager takes responsibility

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
for achieving the results that he controls.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
The next principle of management is discipline.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
I don't think that anything should be added here.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Besides, when Foyol talked about discipline,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
in the early 20th century, Foyol,

57:13.000 --> 57:20.000
discipline was, again, only for the lower level,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
for the linear employees, for the workers.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
So Foyol drew attention to the fact that discipline is not only

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
what the workers should do, but also what concerns the managers themselves.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
That is, the manager should also obey discipline,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
the management discipline.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
And this just means, depending on the previous point,

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
that the manager takes responsibility for the results he gives.

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
And this is where the idea of giving an example comes from.

57:52.000 --> 57:59.000
In the sense that depending on how the manager behaves,

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
it determines the attitude towards him,

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
and most importantly, the final results that his management activity will have.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
The next principle is the principle of initiation.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
A very important principle, and it concerns...

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Of course, this principle was transferred from the military order,

58:17.000 --> 58:23.000
but Foyol drew attention to the biggest trouble of production.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Again, as for Foyol, this is the beginning of the 20th century,

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
and he was engaged in more production,

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
production of some material products, but not services.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Although, again, all those principles that we are now considering

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
are applicable to the management of the services.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
So, as for Foyol, he drew attention to the fact that

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
the biggest trouble of production is that there are a lot of managers.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
The director of the plant, his deputy, department managers,

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
managers of management, managers of workshops, managers of shifts,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
managers of the district, and so on.

59:03.000 --> 59:09.000
Everyone wants to manage, everyone wants to show their power as a control,

59:09.000 --> 59:18.000
and, accordingly, it often turns out that people give contradictory orders.

59:18.000 --> 59:26.000
And, accordingly, there is a problem of how to combine all this into a single whole.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
That is why Foyol drew attention to the fact that

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
there should be a single principle, and at the same time,

59:35.000 --> 59:41.000
the next principle is that there should be a certain line of power.

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
As they say today, it is fashionable to call it the vertical power.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Foyol called it the line of power, or, since it was about production,

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
since it was about scientific approach to management,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
he called it the scalar chain.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The scalar chain is a sequence of elements.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Each subsequent element should be oriented to what is in front of it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
This is the principle that Foyol and his mechanism speak about.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The common goal is set, and then different lower-rank managers

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
get their task within the framework of achieving the common goal.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And within these frameworks, you can act relatively freely.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
But your higher-rank manager should make sure that you,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
first of all, do not go beyond these frameworks,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
otherwise you will invade the sphere of action of another unit, another manager.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And, on the other hand, the final result that you get

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.000
is the necessary intermediate part of the final result

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
for which the production is organized.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The next point Foyol addressed has become very popular today.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Foyol called it the unity of leadership.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
In fact, today this idea is called the unity of the team of managers,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
or the unity of the top management,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
depending on the sphere, the area of action in which it is spread.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Foyol drew attention to the fact that in the beginning it is important,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
but the situation is much worse when there is no agreement among the higher management.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
The higher management is responsible for very large production areas.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
The head of the site is responsible for the work of 5-10 machines.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
We have thousands of machines.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Of course, some chaos will appear if he starts to engage in his own activity,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
but still, this is not a catastrophic chaos.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
If a disagreement appears at the highest level,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000
then there may be difficulties between two rather serious parts of the business,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which will definitely lead to the breakdown of all existing systems and relations.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
As a result, we will get not what we wanted, if we get anything at all.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
As you can see, Foyol looked ahead for almost 50 years.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This is shown in the table we looked at.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The next point Foyol highlights is the subordination of personal interests to the common.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Again, this is an obvious point.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The fact is that every person has his own tasks, interests and approaches.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:07.000
But he came to the organization, to the company, which implements certain tasks.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And here you have to integrate your individual qualities into the common goal.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
In fact, in this case, Foyol is running very far ahead.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
This subordination of personal interests to the common is what is called team building today.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
This is very much in demand.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Moreover, the wider the production area, the more people are engaged in it,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
the more important is the issue of team building.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Foyol, like Taylor, again came from the practice.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
He was engaged in analysis and study of work in large enterprises and factories.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
He drew attention to the fact that if there is a problem of unity,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
if there is a common goal that is shared by the workers,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
the results are much better.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
This is a very important result of Foyol,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000
because it will be the basis of the next direction of the school of human relations.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But again, Taylor also talked about this.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Foyol just highlighted this situation and brought it to the foundation.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
The next principle that is important for management in Foyol is the reward of staff.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Foyol, of course, talks about the material reward.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
If you have achieved the plan, you will receive the appropriate reward.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If you have overcompleted the plan, you will receive the appropriate reward.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000
If you have not completed the plan, there should be some sanctions and fines.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But again, we need to figure it out.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Foyol highlighted the reason for not completing the plan.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Maybe the plan was overcompleted, and it was not your fault.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It was the wrong management who planned it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Then you should be punished, but not you, but the managers who planned it.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So, the reward problem is what we call material stimulation today.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Foyol, of course, talked about material stimulation.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But, as Taylor, Foyol also pointed out that not everything is measured by material stimulation.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000
In fact, Foyol's approaches in his management methods include protection, including non-material stimulation.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Again, this should not be surprised, because what concerns Taylor, Foyol and other authors,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000
about whom we will talk today, they did not create their approaches from the head, not from theory, but from practice.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And that's why they left their name in the history of management,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000
that they were able to capture the main points that arise.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
In addition to material stimulation, a person is interested in reward,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and not always in a purely monetary way.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The same authority, the same respect.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Foyol noted this, but still, the majority of people do it on material stimulation.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
The next principle that Foyol talks about is the centralization of management.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
An important principle from which point of view?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Foyol noticed that very often managers become too many.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And, of course, every person thinks of himself as a boss, feels power as control, forgets about responsibility.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And the problem arises that there are too many bosses, and it's difficult to negotiate with each other.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And the boss has his tasks, his managerial functions, not just executive.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And in this regard, the abundance of leadership, the abundance of managers is the starting point

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:19.000
that can lead to a split within the business.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That's why Foyol says that a centralized management system should be built

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
in order to get rid of extra managers, of extra workers, of the saving of jobs.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
This is the problem that was solved a long time ago.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
This is what Taylor was doing, creating his chronometry, creating his instructions.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And the task was that the less we hire workers, the less we pay, the more profit we have at the output.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Foyol set the same task for the applicant managers.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
The more managers, the bigger the problem.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
That's why we need to find an optimal number of managers, depending on the volume of production,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
depending on the tasks that are set.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And in every particular case, which Foyol considered in every particular factory,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
he calculated the corresponding results.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
The next thing Foyol paid attention to was the principle of justice.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:24.000
There are different theories of motivation, including the theory of justice,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.000
which is that the same work should get the same reward.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
That is, it shouldn't be that two people do the same work, get the same results,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000
but get a two or three times higher material reward.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Foyol paid attention to the fact that people are very sensitive to the fair attitude to themselves.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
If I make some efforts, if I make any actions,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I want these actions to be noticed, approved, so that my initiative is in demand,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
my initiative gets a certain rating.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:28.000
In this regard, Foyol paid attention to the fact that the reward for the work should be fair.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:37.000
In the sense that for the same results, for the same actions, we should get the same reward.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:46.000
In addition, Foyol paid attention to the need for order in official duties.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000
That is, Foyol says that when a person comes to work,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000
whether he is a worker or a manager, he should be familiar with his official duties.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
What are his duties, what will he be asked for, and what rights does he have?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
What right does he have to ask?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It is not possible for a person to come to work, or rather to a managerial job,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and not know the limits of his authority,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.000
not know the sphere of influence he has the right to exert,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and where the limits of responsibility of another person are.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:47.000
In order to avoid misunderstandings, scandals, and divisions between managers,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
there should be order, that is, there should be regulations in the sphere of actions,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
in the sphere of responsibility of each manager, for which he is responsible.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
The next principle that Foyol highlights

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000
is that it is necessary to ensure the stability of the workplace for the staff.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
This is what is characterized by the phrase confidence in the future.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I am a manager, I am a manager, a professional in my field.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I was hired to work for an organization of some business processes.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
At the same time, I must be sure that this is not a temporary organization for me,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
that this is the organization in which I will continue to work.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000
If I start to cope successfully with the tasks I am assigned,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
it will ensure my career growth as a manager.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Accordingly, the stability of the workplace leads to the fact

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
that I will be interested in working in this company, in working informally.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
If I consider it as a temporary place, or I do not associate with this company

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
the principal ideas and views of my future,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
then my attitude to work will be appropriate.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
At the same time, Foyol draws attention to the need to cultivate initiatives.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Initiatives not only for the workers, but also for the managers.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Again, with all the restrictions that we talked about,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
both in the presence of a single beginning and in the presence of a scalar chain of management,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000
in this case it is about the fact that there is a sphere for which I am responsible.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And in this sphere I can carry out an initiative,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I can optimize the working conditions,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I can make some rationalization proposals that, in my opinion, will lead to improvement of the results.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But Foyol emphasizes that any initiative must be responsible.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
For example, there is already a certain established production process.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I make changes, thereby I change and violate the existing system.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Of course, the result can be much better, and then my initiative will be justified.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
But on the other hand, my initiative may not be justified enough.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And in this sense, the introduction of changes in the production process leads to a failure of production.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So, the initiative must have reasonable limits.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And again, as for this initiative, it must be implemented taking into account all the tasks,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
all the principles that are before production.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Well, another point that Foyol highlights and that should be stopped

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
is what Foyol himself calls the corporate spirit.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Here again Foyol jumps very far ahead.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Because at the beginning of the 21st century, in our modern business,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000
the corporate spirit is the education that is worth the price.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It is loyalty to the staff, it is the creation of a staff reserve,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
it is the provision of staff growth within the organization,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
it is the team formation, it is the unity of the team.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It is all the corporate events, corporate meetings, corporate trips.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It is all that creates a certain corporate spirit.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It is all that is hidden under the brand of a particular company.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And the main idea here is that the emphasis is on the attitude of the company to the person.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
A person ceases to be a simple screw.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
A person realizes his importance and importance in the company.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
He understands that his experience is valued.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And if it is appreciated, if it is noticed,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
a person is naturally interested in the further application,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
in the further development of his abilities within the framework of this company.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Of course, Fayol did not describe all this in detail.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
But the general idea of this corporate spirit,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:44.000
laid down by Fayol in the 1920s,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
has found a wide range of distribution,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000
both today and in the subsequent development of the classical management school.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:00.000
In principle, Taylor also talked about this, but he said in general terms.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Fayol formulates this more specifically.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And Fayol begins to introduce this corporate spirit into production,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
creating different kinds of working groups.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And then, when we talk about modern tenancy management,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
we will stop at the corporate spirit separately.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
But it comes up to Fayol as a person who began to introduce this

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
and apply it in different areas of management.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Again, I think these principles are enough to understand

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
the basic positions of the classical direction.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
There may be others.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
But you can familiarize yourself with them in the literature proposed.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
These are the principles that have a significant impact

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and influence on the modern state of management.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The next school, which is a natural continuation of the classical ideas of Fayol,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
is the so-called school of human relations.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Look, as we list the principles we have just discussed,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000
we see that, having begun subjective management, responsibility, economic results,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Fayol is getting closer and closer to taking into account subjective or human factors.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:38.000
In fact, Fayol prepares the ground for management

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and pays more attention to the human qualities and human traits of the employees,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
the staff they manage.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Again, we should pay attention to the fact that the school of human relations

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
has been developing since the 1930s,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
almost in parallel with the classical Fayol school.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000
If we go back to the slide about the evolution of the management thought of the modern age,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
we see that the difference appears at the age of 15.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But the classical school and the school of human relations are practically in sync.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:26.000
The classical school dealt with the problem of management as such,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
from the point of view of managing the results of the system,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
social-economic, social-technical systems, and obtaining the final result.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
As for the school of human relations,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
it actually focuses its main attention on people, on staff,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
on those human, subjective, passionate, qualitative, ambitious desires,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
opportunities that a person has to achieve the final result.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But the school of human relations in management

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
is concerned with the development of the system of relationships between people

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
and the management of this system.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
As for the school of human relations,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
its development begins with the famous Hathorov experiments,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:27.000
which were conducted at the Western Electric plant in America, in the city of Hathorov, starting in 1927.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
This experiment was conducted by a large group of scientists,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
among them were Fritz Lisberger, Elton Mayo, Edith Dickson, and others.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But usually this field is associated with the name Mayo.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Although, maybe this is not entirely fair,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:54.000
because Mayo was one of the participants who did a lot,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
but still one of the organizers of this department was Fritz Lisberger.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
However, I think this is already a recognition of the merit of priorities,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
which is more important for the academic tradition.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
We are interested in the results.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000
As for the results obtained during the Hathorov experiments,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:26.000
it was proven and demonstrated that when we deal with economic relations,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
when we deal with the management system,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000
objective indicators play a significant role.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And when we deal with business, we should, of course,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
be significantly more focused on objective indicators.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
We are interested in the economic results we have obtained.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
We are interested in our place in the market.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
We are interested in how the investments we have made have been repaid.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
But this is the result.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
This result is realized during a certain process.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
The production process, the service delivery process,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
the organization itself,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
and the same people, the same staff,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
the managers, take part in this process.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And as for this school,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
the main focus in this case was on the fact that

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
in addition to the formal organization,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I am the manager, you are my subordinate,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
you should perform my tasks,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
there is also the informal relationship,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the informal organization,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:52.000
which is often much more significant,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
much more important,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
much more perceptive,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
and much more significant for the final result

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
than the whole structure of the formal organization.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
People work,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
and people work,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and an informal relationship arises between them.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You can formally sit from 9 to 6,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and at the same time you can get a much better result,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
depending on your motivation,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
your desire, your needs,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
your loyalty,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
your prospects that you see in this organization

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
or in the organization of competitors.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And accordingly,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
the motivation of your activities that arise in you

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
largely depends on the subjective features of a person.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:49.000
We formulated it as a classical doctrine of human relations.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Everything I just said is related to this doctrine.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And being a psychologist, a social psychologist,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000
we found that the main feature of any organization,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
the main driving force of any organization

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
is the people who work in it

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
and the relations between people in this organization.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
If these are cooperative relations,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
positive relations,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
then the results will be significant,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and the criteria that will be obtained will also be excellent.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
If these relations are competitive, aggressive, conflictive,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
then whatever investments you make in production,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
whatever modern equipment you buy,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
you will not get results that are significantly different from the results of competitors.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
that the Khator experiments were carried out in 1927-1932,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
in the 20th century.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
In fact, it was the time of the Great Depression.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
First of all, the question was whether the organization would survive,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and secondly, whether production would be enough to sell certain products

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000
that would be possible to sell in the conditions of reduced purchasing power of the population.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So, when we formulated this doctrine of human relations,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
it was based on the fact that

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000
the whole basis of this school, this direction of management,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
is that a person is a social being.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Again, let's remember the definition of management that we gave.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
We always talk about social, economic, and social-technical systems.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
In fact, this is a tribute to the school of management,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
to the school of human relations.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Indeed, a person is a social being,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
that is, he is oriented to the behavior of other people,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and included in the context of group behavior.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
This is a very important aspect.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Because if you are in a collective,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
where there is a cool relationship with the leadership,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:36.000
then your initiative may have completely different relations and consequences

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
in terms of your socialization in this collective.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:50.000
If the staff members are in bad relations with their leader,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:57.000
and you are trying to build business relations with him,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
then you may be subject to group ostracism,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
that is, you will be isolated within your group,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
and naturally, when you are in isolation,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
it will be hard for you to work.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And instead of working, you will be immersed in small conflicts,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
that is, you will do anything but work.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
This is what we pay attention to.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And this is what we pay attention to.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Again, the fact is obvious.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Taylor pointed it out, and Fayol talked about it.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But it is we who put these facts, these events,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
in the basic position of our concept, the concept of management,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and focus and pay attention to this very fact.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
At the same time, in the doctrine of human relations,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
great attention is paid to the fact that

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
we should associate human psychological features

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
with the management aspects that arise.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
But it is emphasized that human nature is incompatible

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000
with the strict hierarchy, with the bureaucracy that exists in any organization.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
This is the 1930s, the 20th century,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000
the period of established capitalist production

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
with all its tendencies that exist now.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So, what concerns these tendencies is the hierarchy.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
There is a boss, there are subordinates, there are deputies,

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
there are interns, there are assistants, there are secretaries,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
there are referents, there is a certain procedure for passing documents

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
in order to get the necessary signature.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You must get different visas, legal, financial, accounting,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
economic, industrial and economic.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And only after you have received all the visas

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
can you submit a paper for the signature of the boss.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Getting a visa is a long-term process.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000
It happens that the paper gets to the boss only in a week or two,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
or it won't get there at all because someone will wrap the paper somewhere.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Very often lawyers like to do this.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And, accordingly, while you are making changes,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
the time will pass.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I think that the situation today has not changed at all

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
since the middle of the last century,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
because large corporations are especially active in this.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
If the corporation is medium or small,

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
then the boss is in the zone of direct visibility, direct contact,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and here we can get the result quickly.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Although the consequences can be different.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.000
But if there is a company with already established internal regulations,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
internal regulations,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
then getting a basic signature there is a long-term procedure.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
In the 1930s, we noticed that this bureaucracy

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.000
is incompatible with human desires, with human nature.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And in this case we are talking about the results

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
that can be attributed to management.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Because this bureaucracy, when we talk about management,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
is manifested primarily.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
There are some written and unwritten management norms.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
You can't jump over your head,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
you can't bypass your boss, and so on.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And all this must be taken into account

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
if you really want a conflict-free existence

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and a resulting existence, both for yourself and for the company.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
The next thing that we pay attention to in the Doctrine of Human Relations

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.000
is that the managers of enterprises, managers of different branches,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
should be guided to a significant degree

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
to meet the needs of people.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Because if you are guided only to technical factors,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
improving machines, their modernization,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
acquiring new capacities, it's all good.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But these capacities are a set of hardware, a set of machinery.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Only when someone who can work on this hardware is suitable.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Only then.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
He produces something on it, and only then it is returned.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
You can buy the most wonderful modern computer

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
with a huge number of capabilities,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
a huge hard disk,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
a huge RAM,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and sit and play Tetris on it.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
It happens very often, by the way,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
when the needs of the hardware

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.000
are much greater than the tasks that are set by the people working on it.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Then the question arises,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
why invest additional funds

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and acquire those technical capabilities

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
that are redundant for solving business tasks,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
for solving those management tasks that arise before me.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
We paid attention to this.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:36.000
In fact, if we buy a particular hardware,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
we should take care of it,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
to interest people to work on this hardware,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
and not to spend time on it.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
If you want to be an effective manager,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
you should keep this in mind.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Secondly, you should organize training of staff to work on this hardware.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And again,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
you should start from the fact that a person has different needs.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
When a new hardware is bought, I can be afraid that I won't be able to work on it,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and I will be fired, and someone else will replace me.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
This is a great need to keep a job,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
and this is a need that I want to work here.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
This is a need that can be developed.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
This is a need that can be emphasized.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And when you buy a particular hardware,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000
you should take care that a person does not have fear of work,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
of this most perfect hardware at the moment,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
but that he has a desire to work on it,

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and, accordingly,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:52.000
to contribute to the fact that the efforts put in by a person were noticed,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
were rewarded, were set as an example.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
These are the 30s of the 20th century, when we are talking about it.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And, of course, in the future, this has been used very, very many times.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
This problem has become especially popular today.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And when we talk about the current trends in management,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
we will pay attention to this.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Another thing that can be said about human relations,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
is that we are dependent on management.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
In this case, we are talking about what?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:41.000
In fact, again, the same theory, the idea of justice, which Foyol introduces.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But in this case, we emphasize that the productivity of labor,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and it is very important to keep in mind the manager who organizes the corresponding process,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000
will be more effective if the individual reward is supported by the group.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
For example, there is a certain project group,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
which is aimed at achieving a certain result.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
People make different contributions to achieving this result,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
and the result will be achieved.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Naturally, someone contributed more, someone less.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
This achievement must be evaluated.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
But then you can organize competitions between different groups,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and the group that achieved the best results can get an additional reward.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
How will they distribute it?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
This is the job of the group leader.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:46.000
But in this case, my individual reward is equal to the group's reward.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And I understand that, yes, I have a significant contribution to solving the problem.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
But if there were no support from my colleagues,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
if there were no contribution from them, I would not have achieved the result.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
This is the informal organization of labor,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000
which is the doctrine of human relations that exists.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
It is important for us to contribute to each person,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
but a person is a social being, and we work together with other people.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
So we need to take this social reward into account.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
This is a confirmation of group activity and group significance.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I, as a member of a successful group,

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
this is, again, the task of motivation,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000
which is widely spread today in different concepts of motivation,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:54.000
in the theory of MacLeland, in the theory of Herzberg, in the theory of oil and others.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But it was me who practically justified this result

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
and got experimental data,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
on the basis of which all these theories of motivation were subsequently developed.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:16.000
So, this is what concerns the school of human relations

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
or the doctrine of human relations,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:31.000
which today is an integral attribute of any concept of management.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:39.000
So, we have gradually reached the middle of the 20th century,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:47.000
if we look at our original slide on the evolution of governance thought in the 20th century.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And now we will stop and consider the approaches in management that exist.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000
This is a quantitative approach, a systematic approach, a situational approach and an organizational approach,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:15.000
which is currently the most fashionable, although perhaps the most indisputable.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
But we will consider this when we come to this organizational approach.
