00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I am a director of MBA Start program at Moscow Business School.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Before I came to Moscow Business School, I worked for several years in consulting,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
in companies in the field of professional services, in the field of HR,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
in the field of business management, in the field of business management,

00:23.000 --> 00:37.000
I have a natural and scientific education, and the second, again, in the field of strategic HR.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Therefore, I hope that my short course will be quite interesting and practically useful for you.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
So, dear listeners, today we will discuss the topic of designing a job.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Why is it so important?

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
In the modules of organizational behavior and general management, you have already familiarized yourself with the modern theories of motivation,

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
in which one of the important places is devoted to the content of the work that the employee performs at a modern enterprise.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Today we will see with you how you can effectively work with your subordinates

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
and with the work they do in order to make the overall work of the enterprise as effective as possible.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
So, what are we going to talk about today?

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Today we will talk about what specialization is.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
We will learn about the concept of the limit of specialization.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
We will see what organizational variables are associated with the design of a job.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
We will consider practical approaches to how to design the work of your subordinates in order for them to work effectively

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
and to be as motivated as possible to perform their work to the best of their ability.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
We will look at one model, which is called the socio-technical model of the organization,

02:09.000 --> 02:22.000
and we will study the principles of socio-technical design, which will help you manage the implementation of complex information systems,

02:22.000 --> 02:34.000
some technological innovations, so that these implementations are carried out as painlessly as possible for your organization.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
We will consider the practical aspects of the design of the work of your subordinates

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
and the issues of maintaining the personnel, which are becoming very important at a modern enterprise.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
And at the end we will talk a little about the fact that the design of the work is also associated with the physical equipment of our offices,

02:59.000 --> 03:10.000
our workstations, workplaces, work spaces, where we live and spend more time in our lives than, say, at home.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Let's talk about what specialization is.

03:15.000 --> 03:27.000
At the dawn of the birth of humanity, people realized that each of us likes and succeeds in a certain business better.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Some were engaged in harvesting, others in hunting, and the third was raising children.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And so it happened.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
In the 19th century, Adam Smith was the first to bring the famous example of a pin factory,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
where he painted for his contemporaries, amazed by this,

03:45.000 --> 03:57.000
that one worker who was working on the production of a pin could make only 20 pins in one shift,

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
and, say, seven workers, each of whom specialized in a certain operation,

04:03.000 --> 04:13.000
one pulled out a wire, the other cut it, the third sharpened the end, the fourth made a pin head, the fifth polished, and so on.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
About 40,000 such products could be made in one shift.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
And then, in the era of industrialization, the slogan of Adam Smith,

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
specialize, specialize your workers, and the efficiency of your enterprise will be higher,

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
has always come true and has given very good results.

04:40.000 --> 04:51.000
However, today it is not quite so, and in some cases we can encounter such an effect as the limit of specialization.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
But before we talk about it, let's introduce a number of definitions that are used today in management literature quite widely,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
and which we will use further in this course.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So, speaking of the past, we very often talk about division of labor.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
What is the division of labor within one organization?

05:12.000 --> 05:23.000
This is the division of labor into a number of functions, partial functions, operations, within our organization, within the division of our organization.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
If we talk today about what the specialization of each worker is associated with,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
we immediately recall the concept of duty, duty instruction.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
What are the functions, operations that our workers perform today?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
What is a duty? Let's define.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
This is a set of tasks, work, which are performed by the worker to achieve the goals of the organization.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
Let's talk about how much today we can perceive a position only as a set of certain tasks.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Many modern researchers in the field of management say that this is not quite so.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
At today's enterprise, it is not enough to perform a function, to perform a task, to solve a task.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
You still need to play certain roles.

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
For example, a workshop master at a production site can play the role of a mentor for newly-arrived specialists.

06:27.000 --> 06:37.000
A sales manager can play the role of a consultant for the higher management of the company in the process of developing strategic marketing plans.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
We all play such roles in our workplaces, both ordinary workers and managers.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
What is a role?

06:47.000 --> 06:59.000
A role is a set of behavioral patterns that allow us to achieve the results that are expected from us by the higher management and the business organization as a whole.

06:59.000 --> 07:12.000
Today, every workplace is a position for us and a set of certain roles that a particular person plays in his workplace.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
What is specialization?

07:16.000 --> 07:33.000
Specialization is the concentration of a worker's activities on a certain set of functions, roles and operations, related to the acquisition of certain knowledge by this worker.

07:33.000 --> 07:47.000
Again, going back to the example of a workshop master, who is both a manager of his department and a mentor for newly-arrived employees,

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
we can say that he should have acquired his direct knowledge of how the production process works during his work and, perhaps, while studying somewhere.

07:58.000 --> 08:08.000
He should also have certain knowledge and skills of how to raise our young workers.

08:08.000 --> 08:21.000
Now, let's go back to the idea of Adam Smith that we should specialize our employees as much as possible in order to make the organization work effectively.

08:22.000 --> 08:38.000
The so-called experience curve says that the more repeated operations we perform, the better we do it.

08:38.000 --> 08:47.000
It works for a person who has been hired and it also works for an organization.

08:47.000 --> 09:03.000
But if we talk about a particular person, let's take a production process, a conveyor, a certain psychological and even physical state arises,

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
when it becomes difficult to perform remote work efficiently with a minimum number of errors.

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
Remember the famous movie by Charlie Chaplin, New Times, when poor Charlie twists the same nuts a million times on his conveyor.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
Of course, after another nut, he wants to throw everything away and avoid such work.

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
Now we are giving the most obvious example of low-quality work.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
In fact, any job has a limit of specialization, including a highly qualified one.

09:41.000 --> 09:56.000
A person sometimes needs to change the functions and tasks performed by him in order to make the work effective, with maximum feedback, and motivate the person to do such work.

09:57.000 --> 10:06.000
We can say that in some areas of human activity there is a phenomenon called the effect of professional burnout.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
This effect is often mentioned in connection with stressful situations in the organization.

10:12.000 --> 10:22.000
But you must admit that there are specialties, for example, a doctor who works with seriously ill children, or a teacher of the elementary school,

10:23.000 --> 10:41.000
where even the most favorite work you have dreamed of all your life can cause you a severe state of stress and inner frustration, which will not allow you to continue to perform the work as effectively.

10:42.000 --> 10:54.000
For such specializations and jobs, it is necessary to work out specialized adaptation and rehabilitation periods for these employees.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
There are not enough trainings that allow to reduce the effect of such overload.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
There are complex approaches and specialized programs.

11:06.000 --> 11:17.000
So, what should influence and be provided for by the manager when we design the work of our employee?

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
The main factors of influence are, of course, the enterprise strategy.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Why? Because I give an example.

11:27.000 --> 11:44.000
For example, fast food businesses or cleaning companies, where a lot of low-qualified staff is employed, who do not work in this company for more than two or three months.

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
It can be students who, during the holidays or during the year-end lectures, work at these enterprises.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
It can be pensioners who come to such companies for a certain period.

12:00.000 --> 12:11.000
And such companies have a task to quickly, firstly, put the employee who comes to work in a position for a short time.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
Secondly, it is enough to part with him painlessly.

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
That is why specialization in these companies balances at the level of the threshold of specialization.

12:24.000 --> 12:37.000
Because people who come to this company must quickly master the skills necessary for the operation and pass these skills on to another person who will come to this company in two or three months.

12:38.000 --> 12:53.000
Other companies, for example, consulting business, which are interested in minimizing brain drain in other companies, competitors and, perhaps, even in other states, will build different strategies.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
And in such companies, very often, specialization is quite broad.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
They are growing more like specialists, so-called generalists of the common profile.

13:04.000 --> 13:13.000
The general framework of how work is designed within the framework of one enterprise is set by the organizational structure.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
You have already got acquainted with the types of organizational structures that exist now.

13:21.000 --> 13:41.000
And you know very well that, let's say, in a functional structure or a divisional structure, there are departments in a company that, firstly, unite people with certain skills and knowledge, and, secondly, perform certain functions in the organization.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
Thirdly, the main factor of influence on how we design work is, of course, our main business processes.

13:49.000 --> 14:00.000
And here we must understand, on the one hand, that our business is the production of a stool, or several stools, or we produce software.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
Maybe we are developing some project or the most complex mechanism, a moon rover, a space ship.

14:08.000 --> 14:21.000
These are completely different businesses, different business processes, and the business processes themselves will affect how we design the work of our subordinates.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
And, of course, probably the most important factor is the internal motives of each employee for whom we design this work.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
In some cases, we can say, no, we have a company called Uravnilovka, we all have official instructions.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
They not only allow us to report to the labor inspection, but also to structure the work of each of our subordinates.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
But all people are a little different.

14:49.000 --> 14:59.000
If we talk, again, about the effect of specialization, then, as well as the threshold of pain, the threshold of specialization for each of us will be different.

14:59.000 --> 15:08.000
For example, it is noted that in enterprises where watches are manually assembled, for example, in Switzerland or Japan,

15:08.000 --> 15:18.000
women's labor is used more advantageously, because, apparently, women are more patient, more inclined to perform repeated operations over and over again.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
For many years they were engaged in knitting, sewing, these are quite tedious activities.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
So, today, for each of our employees there is a threshold of specialization.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
And a manager who is attentive to his team must be sure to take this into account and be able to analyze.

15:39.000 --> 15:57.000
Another factor of influence, no less important, is what tasks, what structure of tasks we set for our subordinates, what is the content of these tasks, what levels of responsibility these tasks imply.

15:57.000 --> 16:16.000
Each task has its own motivating potential, so for each task that our subordinate performs, for each task, we must also take into account how much it can motivate our subordinate to effective and successful actions.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
And the last factor, the factor of influence, is the corporate culture of the company. What does corporate culture have to do with it?

16:24.000 --> 16:44.000
In fact, this factor is no less important, because when performing any work in an organization, people gather in an organization to achieve certain goals that are set for the organization.

16:44.000 --> 16:54.000
So, we simply cannot perform work in an organization alone. In order to do it, we need to interact.

16:54.000 --> 17:11.000
Interact at the same hierarchy level where we are, interact with the management, and all these interactions will be supported by certain rules and norms of behavior fixed in the corporate culture of our company.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Therefore, this is also very important.

17:14.000 --> 17:23.000
We have already discussed that one of the important factors of influence on the design of a work is the structure of the tasks that our subordinates solve.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
What should it be like?

17:25.000 --> 17:37.000
Let's turn to the dummy cycle, which you have probably already seen, and which is primarily focused on the function of the manager.

17:37.000 --> 17:55.000
What should the manager do? He must plan, organize, do some work, he must control the execution of this work, and if he detects any deviations, act, change something, and then plan again.

17:55.000 --> 18:12.000
This cycle is repeated. As a rule, we apply this cycle to the work of the manager, but in fact, the ideal structure of the task, the full-fledged task that your subordinate performs, must include all these stages.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
So, when we design the work of our subordinate, it is desirable that the work performed by him includes all four stages.

18:21.000 --> 18:31.000
So that our subordinate participates in the planning stage, the tasks that he has to solve, and, of course, performs them.

18:31.000 --> 18:56.000
He himself was involved in the control measures to assess the quality of the performance of this work, his timeliness, and so on, and had the opportunity and the inner desire to change something so that the work could be performed better, more effectively, and, in some cases, even easier, and, of course, more interesting for him.

18:57.000 --> 19:15.000
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will complete the task for self-checking from 1 to 3. This will help you to consolidate the material you have passed and think more about how you design work for your specific subordinates.

19:15.000 --> 19:35.000
Now let's turn to the research of scientists of the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, which were dedicated to how to design a work to be motivating.

19:35.000 --> 19:52.000
Perhaps the most famous model described is the Hackman model. Hackman argued that the main parameters of the task performed by the worker should be the following.

19:52.000 --> 20:13.000
1. The variety of skills that the worker should use, and, of course, have them in order to solve the tasks set before him. 2. The integrity of the task. What we have discussed is the planning stage, the performance stage, the control stage, and possible changes.

20:14.000 --> 20:24.000
3. The significance of the task. What is the significance of the task? A trivial semi-anecdote, a semi-example from the life of an army officer comes to mind.

20:24.000 --> 20:40.000
When in order to take on another private officer, the senior officer gives an order to sweep the square from here and until lunchtime. And when both of them understand that this task is almost pointless and is given precisely to take on a person.

20:40.000 --> 21:05.000
In some military organizations, I assure you, you will probably find such managers who have nothing to give to their subordinates on a certain day. Let's say, it's New Year's holidays or New Year's break when customers don't buy your company's services so actively, and the contract department sits on hungry loaves.

21:05.000 --> 21:21.000
Therefore, they can be given a task to sweep from here and until lunchtime. So, it is necessary to keep in mind how often we assign such reasonable tasks to our subordinates.

21:21.000 --> 21:38.000
The task should provide a certain autonomy for the employee. Very often, the function of control, the function of making changes, all this is delegated to the manager.

21:38.000 --> 22:02.000
On the other hand, your subordinate should, after all, for some time, solve the task autonomously enough, have the opportunity to request the resources he needs and perform the task without your interference, without the interference of the senior management in what he is doing.

22:02.000 --> 22:18.000
The fifth parameter, according to Hackman, is feedback. Based on his research, Hackman claims that if the task is such and satisfies all five conditions,

22:18.000 --> 22:38.000
then it creates certain positive psychological states for the employee, which allow him to perform the work more effectively, achieve a higher level of quality, be more satisfied and, accordingly, loyal to the employer,

22:38.000 --> 23:00.000
and show more zeal for work, including not being absent at work. Such absence in the West is called absenteeism, when a person sits on his chair, but in fact he is really absent somewhere.

23:00.000 --> 23:20.000
We believe that now, very often, with the help of the Internet, we can do this for a great benefit for both at home and to satisfy our needs in interacting with other people. Therefore, if we have the satisfaction of our work, we will most likely not do so.

23:20.000 --> 23:38.000
Accordingly, if our task satisfies all five criteria, we will consider that our work is well evaluated, that our work is significant, that this task is worth it.

23:38.000 --> 24:07.000
Of course, the Hackman model does not work in all cases. If you recall the theory of X and Y of Douglas McGregor, you will remember that, on the one hand, people can be lazy and not tuned in to intensive work, and, on the other hand, they are inspired by the very opportunity to work and create something.

24:07.000 --> 24:23.000
Therefore, we are all a little different, and even the same person in different periods of his life and career can rather relate to either the X generation or the Y generation.

24:23.000 --> 24:45.000
Therefore, this model, as Hackman claimed, will work only for those who are significantly in need of professional, social, and business growth. If this is not significant for the worker, then it will not work.

24:45.000 --> 25:10.000
Let's look at the factors that other researchers working in this field highlight. Lowler gives credit to the fact that feedback is important and very important in work. Hackman also had it, but Lowler emphasizes special attention to this aspect.

25:10.000 --> 25:20.000
The second factor is the degree of application of skills, not skills and knowledge, but skills that generalize the concept.

25:20.000 --> 25:43.000
The third factor is the independent control of choosing the path to achieve the goal. In this model, the leader does not set a specific task, but sets a goal for the worker, and the worker chooses the path to achieve the goal, and plans his work, controls it, and, of course, performs it.

25:43.000 --> 26:03.000
Robertson and Smith have the main criteria for how many tasks our subordinate solves, how complex these tasks are, and how involved our subordinates are in the activities of self-managed working teams.

26:03.000 --> 26:29.000
If we set a task for a group of people, for a team, and the whole team participates in the planning, implementation, control, and implementation of changes in the work, it turns out that each member of the team is more complete and has a more complete task in terms of its structure, which we talked about earlier.

26:30.000 --> 26:55.000
Again, Robertson and Smith say that the level of responsibility of the worker for choosing the path to achieve the goal is very important, and, of course, good relationships in the team in which he has to interact, and feedback from the person who set this goal, set this task.

26:56.000 --> 27:18.000
Turner and Lawrence emphasize the manager's attention at the end of the 20th century to the fact that work should be diverse, not monotonous, that a person should feel a certain independence that he needs to solve tasks.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
These scientists also said that the following are very important factors.

27:25.000 --> 27:39.000
These are the necessary interactions that are necessary for the solutions of tasks before the worker, for example, the interaction of the manager and subordinates, and additional interactions that are necessary for our worker to solve these tasks.

27:40.000 --> 27:51.000
For example, interaction with the workers of other companies, possibly with clients who are outside the company. This is also very important.

27:52.000 --> 28:10.000
Cooper emphasized the attention of the modern manager on the features set before our subordinates. The goal itself should motivate a person to do his job effectively.

28:10.000 --> 28:36.000
From the point of view of philosophy or ideology, what do we, as managers, achieve when designing the work of a certain person? In fact, everything is very simple. We achieve a balance between organizational goals and goals of our specific worker, Ivan Ivanovich, who works in our team today.

28:37.000 --> 28:47.000
Let's consolidate the knowledge we have gained and perform exercises 4 and 5.

28:48.000 --> 29:07.000
Now let's go back to the ground. Let's forget about the researchers who have been devoted to this topic for a long time and talk about specific tools that allow us to design the work of our subordinates.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
The first tool that managers talked about at the beginning of the 20th century was the expansion of work.

29:18.000 --> 29:37.000
Then, in the midst of the industrialization era, our industrial production used new technologies and tools every year, which seemed to allow enterprises to work more effectively, with more attachment.

29:38.000 --> 29:49.000
Nevertheless, the introduction of all these technical innovations resulted in the resistance of staff, strikes, and the number of mistakes made by subordinates increased.

29:50.000 --> 29:58.000
The trend of that time was that the specialization of each worker should be at the maximum level.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
Then managers decided that they should expand the work of Charlie Chaplin on the assembly line.

30:08.000 --> 30:17.000
He should not only tighten nuts, but also screw in screws and attach other things to our part.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
This is called the expansion of work.

30:21.000 --> 30:30.000
When we increase the number of operations performed by one worker due to similar operations that he performed earlier.

30:31.000 --> 30:42.000
For example, our secretary can only sort and distribute incoming messages, mail, e-mail, etc.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
We can expand his work by offering him to work with incoming messages.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
Or, for example, I will describe a rather real situation.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
In the 1990s, business related to the sale of air tickets abroad began to develop quite actively in Russia.

31:05.000 --> 31:15.000
The iron curtain has been dissolved, and therefore, Russians, for example, began their travel life in this period.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
That is why, for example, there were quite a lot of tourist agencies in Moscow that specialized in the sale of air tickets.

31:23.000 --> 31:36.000
Moreover, people came to work in them with a high education, a fairly wide view, simply because, as you know, at that time many state enterprises switched to business.

31:37.000 --> 31:45.000
And so they happily learned a new business, began to use the Western booking systems of air tickets, and they were able to work.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
And they made quite a few mistakes.

31:49.000 --> 31:57.000
But a year after one of such enterprises was formed, the management began to notice that the percentage of incorrectly issued air tickets was growing.

31:58.000 --> 32:10.000
Naturally, the management did not immediately guess what the matter was, blamed the workers in some way, fined them somewhere, but this did not lead to any positive results for the organization.

32:10.000 --> 32:26.000
And only an invited psychologist guessed that people with a fairly high level of education, who could do various things in this period, were a little tired of the functions they performed.

32:26.000 --> 32:43.000
Then the psychologist offered the manager, let's offer our consultants on air tickets to perform a number of other works that will be in the same area, but will differ from a simple sale ticket.

32:43.000 --> 32:58.000
They were offered, at that time the company already had the Internet, to consult with buyers in addition to what weather conditions are appropriate, finding the appropriate information.

32:58.000 --> 33:24.000
And if a Russian resident flies abroad, to Frankfurt or Düsseldorf, where there are very complex airports, it is difficult to understand, then the airport scheme should be printed out and the passenger should be consulted in detail in advance on how to behave if he needs to make a transfer.

33:24.000 --> 33:34.000
Strangely, the manager saw after a while that the number of errors was high enough, and in this company it decreased.

33:34.000 --> 33:51.000
Therefore, the expansion of the work can be used, but this tool does not always work, because many people can honor this increase in load when the task is basically the same, the level of responsibility is approximately the same.

33:51.000 --> 34:05.000
The feedback does not change. Therefore, I would consider this tool a little outdated and would not recommend using it, with the exception of a few.

34:05.000 --> 34:14.000
The next tool we will talk about is a very promising and interesting tool, in my opinion, it is the rotation of work.

34:14.000 --> 34:29.000
Again, if we turn to a primitive, but clear example of the production process, this is when workers exchange functions with each other for a certain period of time.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
For example, today I was tightening nuts, and my neighbor was screwing screws, and the next day we exchanged them.

34:35.000 --> 34:52.000
If we talk about other businesses, then in them the rotation of work allows not only to ensure the interoperability of employees, which is very important for production, but also to solve a number of other problems.

34:53.000 --> 35:03.000
The rotation allows you to effectively learn and improve the system of interaction and communication in the company.

35:03.000 --> 35:14.000
I will give another example. You probably know that very often the sales department employees conflict with the finance department.

35:14.000 --> 35:34.000
This is a typical situation for a Russian enterprise, because the task of the finance department is to correctly select and take into account all the primary payment documents, contracts and other documentation that allows the finance department to report to the tax service.

35:34.000 --> 35:55.000
And the sales department has a task to get as much money as possible from the client. Thus, the tasks are quite different, and the sales department is sometimes cool in relation to what documents the client should provide to ensure that the payment is correct.

35:56.000 --> 36:09.000
In one company, a sales department employee who had been working there for several years realized that he was tired of interacting with clients and wanted to change his job.

36:09.000 --> 36:25.000
But the climate in the company was comfortable enough for him, and he did not want to say goodbye to it. Therefore, he approached his manager and said, Ivan Petrovich, I can't do sales anymore, I would like to do something else.

36:25.000 --> 36:46.000
And then the wise manager said, okay, you work great with clients and you know what kind of documentation should be in this area. Maybe you will deal with the issues of managing the financial department for some time. We'll see, maybe you'll like it.

36:47.000 --> 37:09.000
The employee agreed and went to work in the finance department. When he began to communicate more closely with his colleagues, accountants, financiers, and conduct accounting for sales, he became more familiar with the problems of accountants and financiers.

37:10.000 --> 37:25.000
Thus, he facilitated the establishment of a more productive dialogue between the departments, because he knew perfectly well the specifics of the work of the salesmen and the specifics of the work of the finance department.

37:25.000 --> 37:37.000
And some tension, as well as many conflicts that were previously, were leveled with the help of such an employee. And this was a certain rotation.

37:37.000 --> 37:56.000
A lot is being written about this tool in the West now, as a tool for training personnel and redesigning their work. In order for an employee at a certain stage of their career to understand whether he can do some other business in the company, he must try to do it.

37:56.000 --> 38:11.000
Just as you can't try to jump without jumping. Therefore, both the production and non-production rotation makes the work more interesting.

38:11.000 --> 38:35.000
The next tool, this term was first introduced by Friedrich Herzberg, is called enrichment of work. If we take the classic definition, then this is a vertical expansion of the tasks, ensuring greater autonomy in performing tasks and increasing responsibility for the quality of their execution.

38:35.000 --> 38:47.000
In fact, enrichment of work is a refraction of our cycle of during, which we talked about, planning, doing, controlling, influencing the work of our employee.

38:47.000 --> 39:10.000
Another example. An industrial enterprise, a factory, in the early 2000s, works quite successfully. The factory is run by a master who has dedicated more than one decade of his life to this factory and is ready to retire.

39:11.000 --> 39:31.000
But the master values both the colleagues and the head of the factory. Therefore, when the master came to the head and said, enough, I want to take care of the family, the country, the garden, I probably have to go, I am ready to say goodbye to this factory, although I gave it a lot of time, strength, energy, and to leave.

39:32.000 --> 39:55.000
The head said, well, think about it, but first, please participate in the program of recruiting our new apprentices, our new employees who will come to us in a week. Please tell them about the factory. We have so few employees who have worked here for several decades.

39:56.000 --> 40:14.000
And the master agreed. He told us so interestingly about what the factory does, how the brigades work at the factory, that almost all the graduates of local professional schools came to work at this particular enterprise.

40:14.000 --> 40:37.000
Then the director of the staff of this enterprise and his manager decided to offer the master, Maxim Petrovich, maybe you will head the project, our program, it is not necessary to do as much work as you do in the workshop now, you can take care of the upbringing of our youth.

40:38.000 --> 41:00.000
The master thought, said, let me try. And then? And then a whole program of training young specialists grew at the factory, and our workshop was engaged in this project for everyone, in fact, from the moment of planning to the moment of controlling the results.

41:01.000 --> 41:07.000
He liked this work, he liked it, and therefore it was performed as effectively as possible.

41:08.000 --> 41:33.000
In the same way, you can enrich the work of your subordinates, giving them the opportunity to implement a holistic project that will include all stages of the dueling cycle, or any task for which the subordinate will be responsible and will be actively involved at the stage of its planning.

41:34.000 --> 41:53.000
The next tool used to design the work of subordinates is the creation of self-managed teams. In fact, this is the stimulation of group work without direct administrative control over their activities.

41:54.000 --> 42:06.000
In this case, of course, absolutely without the function of control, such a team cannot exist, but the control should be strategic, guiding, supporting the work of this team.

42:07.000 --> 42:20.000
One of the tools that is used now and stimulates the work of self-managed teams, from which it would be possible to start at the enterprise, is the so-called training of actions.

42:21.000 --> 42:40.000
This technology was invented by Ray Crevance. He said that our knowledge, on the one hand, can be programmed, we can read a textbook, go through training, and on the other hand, it depends on how skillfully we can put and answer the questions we are asked.

42:41.000 --> 42:58.000
Therefore, you can offer a task to a group of your subordinate. For example, guys, study how good the compensation system in our company is and offer a solution.

42:58.000 --> 43:15.000
This solution will be protected by the board of directors, and the best solutions will be implemented in the practice of the company's activities. At the same time, only on a voluntary basis can you join this team. If there is a desire to work on this issue, the issue will be resolved.

43:15.000 --> 43:39.000
Each member of the team at the planning stage receives its own small piece of the task, for example, to analyze the tools of non-material motivation in the company that support the compensation system, or to analyze the labor market as a whole in the region and the proposals of other companies to compare with this.

43:39.000 --> 43:52.000
This technology stimulates creativity and interest in work, and it engages all team members in all stages of the development cycle.

43:53.000 --> 44:05.000
The last tool of the work, the design of the work that is being used now, is the design of work with high performance indicators.

44:05.000 --> 44:34.000
How is this done? This is done only as a result of a large and tedious work, when you identify in your industry, in the group of enterprises that work in your field of specialization, which enterprise uses the highest standards, the highest level is set for the employee.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
The higher the employee should jump, the more interesting it is for him to do this.

44:41.000 --> 44:56.000
The same Hackman model, which we were looking at a little earlier, proposed the following simple actions that affect the motivating nature of our tasks.

44:56.000 --> 45:12.000
If we want to increase the variety of skills and knowledge that our subordinates use and ensure the integrity of the task, we must combine the tasks that we have and give them to one of our subordinates.

45:12.000 --> 45:29.000
If we want to ensure the integrity of the task and focus on its significance, we must form completed, full-fledged tasks.

45:29.000 --> 45:42.000
Hackman also recommends that each of our subordinates establish direct connections with their clients. Why is this necessary?

45:42.000 --> 46:01.000
So that the feedback is complete, so that we receive not only approval or kicks from our managers, but also directly control how clearly and correctly we meet the requests of our clients.

46:01.000 --> 46:25.000
The client may be an external one, if it concerns the sales department employee. The client may be an internal one, if I am a representative of the company's legal service and I consider the request, analyze the contracts that the sales manager provides me.

46:25.000 --> 46:35.000
My client is the sales manager, I must process the contract presented to me in due time and return it to the sales manager, and the client is the one who receives it.

46:35.000 --> 46:53.000
Hackman recommends expanding the vertical tasks. Let's go back to Gertzberg. This is in line with enriching the work in Gertzberg. Hackman recommends analyzing and creating additional feedback channels.

46:53.000 --> 47:12.000
I will give you a few examples of bright and useful tools that are used by modern companies and that you can observe. For example, Delta Airlines recently developed a program for the most loyal clients.

47:12.000 --> 47:33.000
If you fly over the Earth more than 100 km using Delta, you get a set of coupons of $ 50, $ 20, $ 10. You can give each of these coupons to the airline employee whose work impressed you the most.

47:33.000 --> 47:55.000
Accordingly, the airline employee can exchange these coupons for real money. Many hotels have developed similar feedback systems for their clients, where a competition is held for the best hotel worker, according to the results of which the relevant workers receive valuable prizes.

47:56.000 --> 48:09.000
In order to fix the material, please pause the video and complete the tasks 6, 7, 8 for self-checking.

48:10.000 --> 48:25.000
Let's now turn to another model that was also developed in the last century, but now, at the beginning of the 21st century, has undergone some changes and can be used for your benefit.

48:25.000 --> 48:41.000
What is this model? It is a model of an organization as a socio-technical system. Again, starting from the industrialization era, it was revealed that many technical innovations do not lead to the expected results.

48:41.000 --> 48:54.000
Why? Because when designing them, certain requirements were not taken into account, which the social subsystem of the organization sets out for how such innovations should be introduced.

48:55.000 --> 49:04.000
In the 20th century, a number of scientists proposed the following model. Our organization consists of two main systems.

49:04.000 --> 49:16.000
This is the technical subsystem, these are the mechanisms, equipment, software, technological solutions of a variety of nature, and the social system.

49:17.000 --> 49:26.000
These are the people working in the organization, this is the relationship between them, this is the knowledge, skills, competencies, needs of our worker.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
This is the system of rewards and the structure of power and management in the organization.

49:33.000 --> 49:44.000
The basic principles of socio-technical design were developed in the 1970s, but then, at the beginning of the 21st century, were somewhat improved.

49:44.000 --> 49:56.000
What are they talking about? That the design of the workplace in the situation of today's constant changes should be done as follows.

49:56.000 --> 50:16.000
First, the design process must correspond to its goals. It's very simple. If you design the place of Ivan Ivanovich, you should involve him in the design process, in planning what he will do tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and not to make it out of what he did the day before yesterday.

50:16.000 --> 50:34.000
The second principle is that the goals of the design must be clear, clear, and clearly set, but the tools and ways to achieve the goals can be chosen by the worker or a group of workers independently.

50:34.000 --> 50:58.000
For example, one of the Western organizations implemented the following program. All the premises of the organization were given to the workers to organize the workplace themselves in the way they were comfortable with the tasks assigned to them.

50:58.000 --> 51:16.000
The third principle is that the function of controlling possible deviations should be implemented as closely as possible to the place of potential deviation.

51:16.000 --> 51:34.000
If we turn to the traditional hierarchical structure of the organization, for example, the function of control is implemented in the service of internal control or management of the organization, and defects and defects may appear in the production process.

51:34.000 --> 51:59.000
If the worker at the production site is not motivated to declare a defect, he can declare a defect, a low-quality material, at the output of the production process, only by the IT department. Accordingly, through the IT manager, through the division manager, this signal will return back to the worker who made a mistake.

51:59.000 --> 52:24.000
Thus, the processing time of this alarm signal about a defect is increasingly increased, and in the process of working with a defective product, several dozen people are already busy. Accordingly, the work with a defective product is becoming more expensive.

52:25.000 --> 52:40.000
I can give an example of one of the Russian enterprises that acted as follows. This is a company that produces GoFrotars, called Gotek.

52:40.000 --> 52:53.000
The employees of the production process were motivated to declare defective products if they fall at any stage of the production cycle to this worker.

52:53.000 --> 53:14.000
At the same time, he received bonuses not only for a certain production, but also made so many boxes. And the number of boxes paid included the defective products or blanks that reached him at this stage.

53:14.000 --> 53:23.000
Thus, the company increased the quality of the produced product and reduced the percentage of the final defect.

53:24.000 --> 53:34.000
The next principle of socio-technical design is that managers are multifunctional people by nature.

53:34.000 --> 53:54.000
Do not give your subordinate a task such as screwing a nut and that's it. Consider your subordinate as a tool, although I don't like this word, which can perform various functions and tasks, and give them to him.

53:55.000 --> 54:09.000
The next principle is the principle of open borders. In an organization, you can not always design a job, taking into account only the tasks that are before the subordinate.

54:09.000 --> 54:22.000
And not only can you take into account such tasks, but you should take into account and keep in mind the tasks that go beyond the team that is subordinate to him.

54:22.000 --> 54:32.000
This will motivate the subordinates to expand the circle of vision and to build an effective system of interaction with colleagues of other departments.

54:32.000 --> 54:44.000
The next principle of socio-technical design says that all subordinates should receive the information they need for work and when it is necessary.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
It makes no sense to comment here.

54:48.000 --> 55:03.000
The next principle says that all support systems of socio-technical design are a system of rewards, a system of training a set of employees.

55:03.000 --> 55:15.000
And many other organizational subsystems should be congruent with the goals and tasks of socio-technical design, and not contradict them.

55:15.000 --> 55:28.000
For example, we try to introduce collective working principles into the organization, but the system of rewards is focused exclusively on individual rewards.

55:28.000 --> 55:42.000
Thus, the work of our self-managed teams will not be supported by this system, they will be in contradiction and will not give the expected result.

55:42.000 --> 55:56.000
The next principle is also very simple. The manager should take into account the common human values, personal autonomy, the right to freedom of speech, and so on.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
The last principle of socio-technical design is the principle of imperfection.

56:02.000 --> 56:10.000
We have designed work for our subordinates, and, as it seems to us, today, in the most optimal and effective way.

56:10.000 --> 56:24.000
But we cannot stop here, because tomorrow the preferences of our employees will change, and specialization will require some change of skills, knowledge, and so on.

56:24.000 --> 56:31.000
Therefore, this is a continuous process, a cyclical process that must be carried out in the organization permanently.

56:31.000 --> 56:48.000
Today's work on socio-technical design is very often focused on how various automation and software means are being introduced into our companies,

56:48.000 --> 56:58.000
which, among other things, aims to improve certain social functions of the organization, and helps us to interact in a different way.

56:58.000 --> 57:10.000
But, as WISFORS claims, the social system of the organization sets certain requirements for each such innovation.

57:10.000 --> 57:34.000
Just like the software we buy sets certain requirements for the computer we try to install, the social system also sets certain requirements for our information technologies that are introduced into the corporate life of a modern company.

57:34.000 --> 57:49.000
This difference between the requirements set by the social system of the organization and the opportunities provided by modern automation means is called a socio-technical gap.

57:49.000 --> 58:07.000
I can give the following example from the activities of a foreign company in Russia. Several years ago, a telecommunications company decided to introduce a so-called DocFlow system, an electronic document of turnover.

58:07.000 --> 58:18.000
At the same time, all contracts with the company's clients had to be agreed upon within the organization at all levels of management electronically.

58:18.000 --> 58:28.000
This system allowed to track which managers had a particular contract, what reviews managers published for this contract.

58:28.000 --> 58:38.000
It seems that the overall level of education and compatibility with the technological innovations of the company's personnel was very high.

58:38.000 --> 58:51.000
Therefore, the management decided to introduce this system in three days, a five-year plan in three days, and sent a brief instruction on how to use the tool to all sales department employees.

58:51.000 --> 59:00.000
What happened? A few days later, the company's manager received several complaints about the departure. Why?

59:01.000 --> 59:13.000
The issue was solved as follows. It turned out that for the sales department employees, direct contact with the managers was very important,

59:13.000 --> 59:28.000
because the company supplied expensive equipment, and any agreement or will to sign a contract, to change a contract, had to be resolved incredibly quickly.

59:28.000 --> 59:36.000
Sales managers thought that these issues could be solved quickly only by direct contact.

59:36.000 --> 59:49.000
Over time, this situation was resolved, managers were trained, they got used to this system, set certain requirements for the system, which had to be finalized by the programmers.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
Only then did it work in the organization. This happens very often.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:06.000
For example, when such a communication tool as email appeared, it would seem that all business communications should go into this area,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but management practice has shown that this is not the case, and, of course, without personal contact, the communication of managers with subordinates cannot take place.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That is why the projects that imply the introduction of a complex system of automation, let's say, an ERP-level system,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:39.000
require increased attention to the requirements of the organization's social system, which should not contradict the capabilities of these systems.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:49.000
In modern work, it is often discussed, let's say, if we offer employees to discuss some issues on the Internet,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:57.000
then the moderator of this system or the company manager who controls it should remove, for example, negative messages from employees.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:12.000
What right does he have to do this? It's hard to say. Each system must have certain laws embedded inside, as well as the laws in our society that allow us to regulate such situations.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:29.000
For example, the well-known email portal Hotmail.com makes quite strict requirements that if you do not use your mailbox for a certain period of time, a month or two, it should be deleted.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But you must learn and read this rule when you enter the system. And this portal has not received a single complaint from clients who use it for a long time.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
This is because there are certain rules and laws for the use of this portal.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Let's talk again about the important factor in the design of work, which is feedback. If we look at American and Japanese management, we can say that both systems have different rules for stimulating feedback.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:27.000
If the United States is stimulating the initiative of the employee who gave the most profitable solution in terms of the economy for the business as a whole, and, as a rule, this employee receives a large monetary reward,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:50.000
in Japan, employees do not receive financial rewards for their rationalization proposals, but the business rules and corporate culture of Japanese companies have established that the employee must make a proposal, and this is always welcomed by management,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:13.000
about how to simplify the work they do, or make it more attractive, more interesting, so that in the culture of Japanese companies there are already some prerequisites for effective feedback from bottom to top that allow them to design a workplace.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Let's look at what we have in Russia. In Russia, the employee will rather remain silent than ask his boss whether it is time to change the screws or screws to write articles about screws.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Very often, a Russian employee, as well as an employee in many CIS countries, will remain silent about their problem or dissatisfaction with the work being done. Therefore, the task of stimulating feedback lies on the shoulders of managers, primarily linear managers.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That is why it is very important not to forget to ask our subordinates very simple questions. What tasks and tasks do you do today? Try to write and tell me about it. What tasks and tasks do you not want to do tomorrow and the day after? And what tasks would you like to solve tomorrow in your activity?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And, of course, it is very useful to ask yourself questions about how I, as a manager, my organization, as an organization, stimulate the initiative from below regarding the design of the work. Are we ready, I, as a manager, my colleagues, to initiate such conversations that will lead to discussion?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Are there supportive mechanisms that will support this initiative from below? For example, a system of regular attestation in the format of a dialogue, where an employee can and should, according to corporate rules, tell about what he does, what he does not want to do and will not do, and what he wants and will do with great pleasure.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Now let's talk about a very painful issue of the early 21st century, about the retention of staff. We say that if an employee is satisfied with his work, he will not seek an alternative. Let's see what the employee values today.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:47.000
According to the results of a survey conducted in 2000 by McKinsey, the main factors that people named are freedom and autonomy in work, 56%, more than half, this is not so little, and inspiring and challenging work, which, as I said, allows you to say, guys, I did it.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Another study reveals the following factors. The most important factor is a good team. Further, as the number decreases, it is a pleasant working atmosphere, a good salary, interesting work and a flexible working schedule. Let's take this into account when designing a job.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Dr. Phillips conducted a fairly large-scale study on the factors affecting the retention of staff in the early 2000s. He also identified five factors, two of which are directly related to the work of a manager in designing the work of an employee. This is the satisfaction of a particular job that we do and the degree of our immersion in the job.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Dr. Phillips also identified the following temporary critical points. If our employee has worked for 6-8 months in a company, he has the first risk when he can and in some cases resigns at his own will. Perhaps he lacks competence, perhaps he realized that the work he was doing was not up to his parameters.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The next critical point is the so-called crisis of promotion. Three years of work in a company, when a person needs to understand where he is moving. This is not necessarily an ascent up the hierarchy of the management and managerial career. It can be a move horizontally to another department, to other tasks, to some new projects.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:41.000
The last critical point is the crisis of 5 years, when a person gets a little tired of working in the same company, in the same field.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:19.000
The next critical point is the re-design of the work at the level of 2 years of work of an employee in a company and probably 3-4 years. Therefore, keep in mind, dear listeners, that you need to work with your subordinates often and ask them the simplest questions about the tasks they perform.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Also, for yourself, create a certain table in which you can list all your employees and roughly assess the integrity of the tasks they perform.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We talked about how the work can be done more motivating for your subordinates. We talked about the fact that the tasks should be complex, interesting, and different. Nevertheless, never forget that one of the factors that affect a particular work is the needs of a particular person.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That's why you need to be flexible in designing the work. Today, there are many trends that speak about the opposite. Sometimes, people, especially in our period of colossal changes in the Russian economy, get tired of this race, this constant conquest and conquest.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:50.000
For example, headhunting companies note that at the age of 42, a manager who has already created a lot in his career and life, has a certain limit. After 42 years, he prefers to rest on laurels and not conquer more Everest due to his own fatigue.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:17.000
There are also certain trends, for example, the transition of a manager from a larger business company, where they are responsible for a certain section of the company that narrows their specialization, to a small or medium-sized business company, where they become managers of a wider profile and can solve more diverse tasks in their practice.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And they may have fewer limiting conditions for large organizations.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:04.000
This also motivates people. Many polls show that this is important for a person. But it's not just comfort or discomfort of being in a room that is important for employees.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We often forget that the physical equipment of our offices, our premises, where employees can interact, should be designed in such a way that this interaction is not violated and is full.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'll give you an example. In one company specializing in software development, there was a move. Employees moved to a building with a convenient kitchen and dining room, to a new building where there were no such premises, only employees' workplaces, in OpenSpace format.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:12:10.000
For some reason, the management noticed that the market for new versions of manufactured products was slowing down. Naturally, the manager did not immediately think that the disappearance of a smoking room as a physical room or dining room in the company's life could contribute to this.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It turned out that programmers are used to solving individual tasks at work, focusing on software code. But the questions that require creative solutions, interaction between them, they are used to solving in the smoking room or dining room.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:50.000
When it was not, there were fewer appropriate solutions. How much time has passed since the company moved and how long has it been until the company's head and HR director together solved this small problem by allocating the appropriate premises is difficult to say.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:10.000
But similar approaches to designing physical rooms should also be taken into account and can bring certain problems to any organization. For example, I can give you the design studio of Artemiya Lebedeva, which you probably all know well.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:34.000
In her office, there is a notice where employees can sleep during working hours. The company's head thinks that this is also very important because the work is quite creative, not traditional. If a person needs rest, the head will rather provide it so that the employee can then work fully.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So think what you need. It can be a sofa, a cigarette lighter, or a dining room. It depends on what your company specializes in.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Let's summarize. What are the basic factors for motivating work? This is the variety and complexity of the tasks to be solved. This is the responsibility that our employee takes on and feels for the solution to the task you offer him.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:25.000
This is the integrity of the task in terms of including various stages of planning, implementation, control, and making possible changes. These are the features of the goal that we set for our employees.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:45.000
This is the degree of involvement, skills, abilities, and knowledge that our employees have in their heads. And, of course, feedback. How can I, as a manager, competently and positively assess the work performed by my employees?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:15:13.000
How can I guide them smoothly in the necessary direction, strategically guide them, but not restrict their freedom in choosing the tools for achieving the goals set before them?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Universalism is impossible here. An individual approach is necessary for every person, every workplace, every position. And let me remind you once again that designing a job not only motivates. These tools that we talked about today allow you to keep high-performance employees.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I can say, based on the data of the McKinsey poll, which we talked about, that less than 10% of respondents believe that their companies know who is a high-performance employee and encourage high-performance employees.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:17.000
We must identify these employees, we must approach the design issues as carefully and fully as possible. It is their work that is very difficult to keep, and the company is always in great need.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Therefore, we must remember that there are critical points in the career of every employee. This is the beginning of a career, this is a crisis of promotion, and this is a crisis of fatigue.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:44.000
To consolidate the material you have passed, you need to pause your video projector and complete the task 9.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000
To consolidate the material you have passed, you need to pause your video projector and complete the task 9.
