00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Let's discuss the quantitative approach of management science,

00:07.000 --> 00:19.000
or quantitative approach to management analysis, quantitative approach to the management system.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
What is the main idea in this approach?

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
We have discussed Taylor's approach, Foyle's approach, the approach of the relationship between people,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
and we have been discussing this for at least an hour and a half.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
But the main idea is that we speak.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
We give different words, we give different examples, we give the opinions of certain authors,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
we address our own experience, but these are all words.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes, we are constantly focused on economic results, yes, we are constantly focused on business processes,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
yes, we are constantly focused on the goals that are in front of us,

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
but we still do it word for word, without any numbers.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, in modern terms, this is so-called humanitarian knowledge or social knowledge.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
This is what is necessary.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
And, of course, when we study management, we need to be able to provide material,

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
to be able to present ourselves, to present our idea, to present the company.

01:35.000 --> 01:48.000
That is, the ability to present material, the ability to communicate, the ability to build a relationship is very important.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And, of course, in no case does anyone deny this.

01:52.000 --> 02:02.000
But as for the middle of the 20th century, this time was associated with the development

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
and widespread implementation of the results of natural sciences.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
At this time, computer technology from the 1940s and the 20th century appeared,

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
software appeared, automatic tracking devices appeared.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
As for the middle of the 20th century, this is post-war period.

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
And the war period led to the introduction and development of various dispatch systems,

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
radar systems, notification systems, warning systems, information transmission systems, information processing systems,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
information control systems.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
The middle of the 20th century is the time of the development of information theory.

02:49.000 --> 03:01.000
This is the time of formalization of both natural sciences and humanitarian knowledge.

03:02.000 --> 03:12.000
Naturally, if we are talking about management, many supporters of the management concept theorists

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
have said that it would be good to switch from all the existing words to their mathematical expression.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
Because someone says it well, someone has said something so wonderful that we sit and open our mouths,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
and then we think, what did we talk about for two hours?

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
On the other hand, if we take the principle of the same foil, we have listed more than a dozen,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
but again, we remembered something, we did not remember something.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
The problem is one.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
What are the criteria that will prove to us that this principle is really successful,

03:50.000 --> 04:00.000
this is not successful, on what basis can we evaluate, compare and find out which of them is more important,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
which of them is more significant, which of them is dominant, on which it should be based.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
The problem of measurement arises.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
In business, this is also a very important problem.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
I have invested a certain amount of money, how much will I get in the end, what is the delta, what is the profit,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
what are the taxes, what are the prospects.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
Business likes to count, and this is natural, in the end, the whole business is tied to getting the result.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You all know this very well.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So, the quantitative school of management science, or quantitative approach,

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
it just set the task that there is a lot of management concepts that justified themselves.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
A very important aspect, it was justified.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
We talked about the basic concepts.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Of course, at the same time, there were different approaches, which we can't even find in textbooks now,

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
because they were all-time, they did not have any impact on management, so they were forgotten.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
But there are these concepts, their introduction led to any results.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
But why is the introduction of, for example, the concept of Foyol, the concept of Taylor,

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
the concept of the Dankrin of human relations, in some organizations, in some enterprises, in one production,

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
gives wonderful results, in another production, gives even better results,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
in the third production, the results do not change at all.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
We introduce the same thing.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
So, the problem depends on the fact that, perhaps, these or other approaches are introduced by different people,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
who have different levels of competence in the introduction.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Naturally, we are interested in attracting those people,

05:50.000 --> 06:01.000
who we will pay, but who will introduce those or other management approaches, so that we get the desired result.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
How to measure these people, how to measure specialists?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
How, first, to select the concepts that we want to introduce,

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
which will be useful for our production, for our tasks, for our market sector?

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
How, after the chosen concept, to select those consultants, who successfully introduce them?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And how to evaluate the results of the introduction?

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
The return of investment, the same, in education, in development, in assessment, in motivation,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
in the final results that we get.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
To do this, we need to create certain quantitative mathematical models.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
This is the main task of the quantitative approach.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
In fact, it does not offer fundamentally new ideas.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
It's the same Taylor, it's the same Fayol, it's the same Rieslinger-Mayoz, the Declaration of Human Relations,

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
but the quantitative approach tries to form and build a model of each of these approaches.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
A mathematical model, a symbolic model, a model that gives the possibility of measurement,

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
gives the possibility of empirical justification, and what else is very important, a model that is operational.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Introduction of a concept is correct, but it is very general.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
What should I introduce?

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
What processes, what operations, what steps, stages of action should I take?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
What steps can I skip?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
What steps should I focus more attention on?

07:42.000 --> 07:52.000
The model is good because it gives a visible list of steps, a visible list of actions,

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
and I can follow the steps, what I do, how I do it, and not move on to the next step

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
if I see that my previous step has not yet been done.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
It's unacceptable to skip.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
It's very important, obviously, in education.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
If, for example, a person has no idea about debit and credit,

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
it's pointless to start a discussion with him about different accounting and economic approaches and ideas.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
He needs to be taught about himself.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
The same thing with management.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
Before introducing some final points, like team formation,

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
a scalar chain of management, system approaches, and result-oriented approaches,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
it's important to understand if a person knows what these terms mean.

08:42.000 --> 08:51.000
That's why a key approach is a task to formalize the approaches already recommended by the management,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
to build a mathematical model.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Of course, the closer we get to the end of the 20th century,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
the more we see that the number of approaches that emerged in the middle of the 20th century

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
continues to this day.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Today, new ideas and approaches emerge.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
At the end, we'll talk about the tendency of learning organizations.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
This is one of the ways to develop a number of approaches.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Another model.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
There are quite a lot of management models today.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Each model claims to solve certain tasks.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And it does it better than other models.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
These models need to be translated into mathematical language,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
and then presented with logical schemes.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Either yes or no.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
In the sense that there are certain branches of solutions,

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
and if you follow the corresponding transition, you'll get the next step.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
If you don't make a transition from one action to another, it's pointless to develop further.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
So, we're talking about building a tree of solutions,

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
known from mathematics, management, and mechanisms,

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
where visually and especially with the help of modern computing,

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
you can imagine the transition stages to achieve the goal.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Complex moments, complex aspects.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
We'll talk about the tree of solutions,

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
and we'll talk about the system approach in management a bit later.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Besides the tree of solutions,

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
you can use various modeling methods in the conditions of uncertainty.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
There are a lot of statistical methods in mathematics.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Stochastic methods.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Discrete analysis.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Variational analysis.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Factorial analysis.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Cluster analysis.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
All of these are complex mathematical methods.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
It's something that takes years to understand,

11:07.000 --> 11:17.000
but you don't need to go deep into the process of modeling to apply it.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
We need results.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
We can hire consultants to do all of this,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
and then we'll get some recommendations

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
based on the models we can use.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
These recommendations can be clear,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
they can be paradoxical, they can be unexpected.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
But to get them, there are professional specialists who do this.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
We'll pay them for this,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
in order to get normal recommendations and implement them.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Modern management is a very complex system,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
professionally, as we've talked about,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
and it requires hiring different specialists.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
Just like Fayol talked about the need to divide the work,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
it's pointless to look for a specialist

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
who can deal with all mathematical methods.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
There are good theorists, good practitioners,

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
great implementers of these or other solutions.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
We need to implement the recommendations we are given.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
As for the models,

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
there is a common model of goal management.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
When certain tasks are set,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
certain goals are set,

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
and then I track not the process that leads to their solution,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
but the final results I get,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
and the boundaries that can be cut off,

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
different wrong approaches, different wrong results.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Budgeting is a problem that is very important

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
in terms of financing the management system,

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
and which allows me to set priorities,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
to organize motivation,

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
to build relationships between people, suppliers,

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
different departments of one organization.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
Again, there are different mathematical methods

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
that exist today,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
as well as management methods,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
for example, quality circles,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
which we'll talk about in the conclusion,

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
we'll consider the fashionable theory of quality management, etc.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
But when we talk about quantitative management,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
we shouldn't forget that the model is just one of the forms of reality.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
The model can be very beautiful,

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
but the results it gives us may seem very small.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Therefore, the criterion is practice,

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
the practical business result we get.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I want to draw your attention to the fact

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
that the task of quantitative management

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
is not to create new concepts,

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
but to formalize existing concepts that justify themselves,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to model them,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
so that we have an opportunity to measure

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
and control the implementation process itself,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
and to get the desired result.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
As for this school,

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
there are different management strategies

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
that were implemented in the 20th century

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
within this quantitative management school.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
As for these approaches,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
they are described in the materials

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
you received for our course,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
they are described in the literature.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
And, accordingly, these are different ways

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
of implementing quantitative approaches.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Here on the slide you can see these directions.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
These are the directions that were widely developed

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
from the 60s to the 90s,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
and which, in one way or another,

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
try to quantitatively reflect the realities of the business of that time,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
as well as the realities that appeared in business,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
and which must be taken into account.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
These are different concepts and ideas

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
that we can familiarize ourselves with,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
and we can apply them.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But these are specific options that can be known,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
but which are not as fundamental as the methodology of the approach

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
that we are considering.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Therefore, now we move on to the next approach,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
which is associated with management,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
which has had a significant impact on management.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
This is the so-called process approach to management,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
associated with Porter.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
The approach he proposed has received a lot of attention.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Why?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Again, we talked about this at the beginning.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
If we consider a business process or any activity,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
it is always characterized by two characteristics.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
The process, the method of achieving some results,

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
and the result, what I eventually achieved.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
As for management,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
these two processes are presented particularly clearly.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
There are wonderful managers and wonderful managers

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
who are very good at creating something.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
A new organization,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
a new structure system in the organization,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
new departments,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
new structures and their introduction into the market.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
They like to organize processes.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
When something has already been achieved,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
these people cannot stop

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
and cannot support the state of the system

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
at the level achieved, at the achieved results,

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
in order for the system to reproduce the desired results.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
These people need to constantly change something,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
constantly bring in some innovations, etc.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
As long as the organization or process is being created,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
these people are very successful,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
they are in their place.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
But when the result is achieved,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
already a good result,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
already a desired result,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
the result is brought to the market,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
then if we start to bring in some new additions,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
then the situation is getting worse.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
From the point of view of the economy,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
because the product is in demand,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
and then it is brought in by some changes,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
and it is not a fact that the changes

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
will be used by the same consumer demand as before.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
After all, consumers are people,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
they also get used to something.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
And if we see constant changes,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
it does not always suit us.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
For example, we can take the Microsoft Office program,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
which is constantly changing.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
We get used to some Office,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
and we use it.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Then another Office appears.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Of course, it retains all the previous features

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and adds new ones,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
but changes are taking place,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
including the usual functions.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The hotkeys are changing,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
the way to call functions is changing,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
the usual system of actions is changing.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And what does it lead to?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
We know that every new Office,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
for example, the 2007 Office,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
has a huge number of new advantages

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
that may be interesting to us.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
But nevertheless,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
we are already used to the previous Office,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
and we are already working on automatism.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
And, accordingly, for a very long time

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
we will work on the old Office

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
and prevent our employees

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
from switching to other programs.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
The same problem is with reading files

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
in older versions, which often arise.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
This is a process situation,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
a process of constant change.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And there are other people

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
who find it very difficult to create something,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
very difficult to change something,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
very difficult to be present and lead.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
We are talking about management,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
about the process of change,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
about the process of innovation.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
But if there is already a well-established system

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
where the control function is necessary,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
in the sense that we talked about,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
the control of the constant feedback

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
with the results we get,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
the planning function,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
there are already some plans,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
the organization of these plans in different ways,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
the organization of the already existing result,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and the function of the implementation

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
of the already developed, justified motivation schemes,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
then these people are in their place.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
But if there are some changes,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
then, accordingly, they cannot be rebuilt.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
There are what are called process people

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
and there are result people.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
And depending on those tasks,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
depending on those circumstances

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
that arise, both good and bad,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
As for the theories that we have considered,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
starting from Taylor, Fayol,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
the control of thought

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
or the doctrine of human relations,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
in fact, these are resultive theories.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
The main thing here is the achieved result.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Even quantitative theory is also a resultive theory.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
We are building a model of achieving

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
certain results.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Porter pays attention to the process itself.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And this is very much in demand.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Why?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Because modern business,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
as we have repeatedly said,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
as you know it perfectly,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
is a constantly changing thing.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Norms are changing, rules are changing,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
normative acts, documents, and so on, are changing.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
And you can't get the same result all the time.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
In the end, the form of tax accountability changes,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and, accordingly, it is necessary to constantly

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
redo something.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
That's why the social and economic demands

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
that business has,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
that management has,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
are so complex that the modern conditions

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
require a process approach.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
That's why the idea of process management

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
proposed by Porter

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
has very well met the needs of the time.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
It was proposed in the second half of the 20th century,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
and since then it has been a success,

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
and modern management is often a process management.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
At the same time, this process approach

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
is based on relatively simple ideas.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Any approach is good in its simplicity.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
We can use some very sophisticated,

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
very sophisticated theoretical approach to management.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It may look very beautiful on paper,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
but how to implement it?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
It is very easy to implement,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
and it is clear how to achieve it.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
As for Porter,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
it has three main processes in any business.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
The first one is the main processes.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
That is, the whole set of processes,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
the whole set of activities,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
the whole set of operational steps

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
that are aimed at achieving the result

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
that my company is engaged in.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
If it is production,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
then it is the production process of cars,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
medicines, computers,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
what the company does.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
If it is services,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
then it is the process of providing services.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
That is, when the methods of achieving the results

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
that I sell are prescribed,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
the main processes of the business

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
that bring me profit,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
the main processes in which I invest money

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
in order to get a return

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
But, of course,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
the main processes do not exist in a vacuum.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I constantly draw attention to the fact

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
that the whole business exists among other people,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
that the whole business exists in society,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
in the state, in its social and political institutions.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
So, all these main processes

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
are associated with the methods of action

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
that support these processes.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Or this is what Porter calls auxiliary processes.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
If we produce something,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
we need some details.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
These details are produced in another company,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
in another place.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And, accordingly,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I need to organize contractual relations with this company.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I need to organize delivery,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I need to organize storage,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I need to organize the export from the warehouse

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
at the right time,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
the right amount of details.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
I need to organize it so that these details

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
are as much as necessary,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
so that the warehouses are not overfilled,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
so that there is no loss for my company.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
This is the whole combination of logistics,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
the combination of additional sources of financing,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
the combination of additional activities.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
These are all auxiliary processes.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
This is what improves, optimizes,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
adds, develops the main processes,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
speeds them up,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
increases their effectiveness,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
increases their output.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Naturally, without auxiliary processes,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
the main processes are impossible.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
But without the main processes,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
the auxiliary processes are pointless.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
If I don't use the telecommunications workpiece,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
then why do I need the warehouses

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
if they are not necessarily needed?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
It is very important that the main auxiliary processes

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
are not mutually dependent,

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
because they are based on each other,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
they support each other,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
and the violation of communication between them

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
leads to the fact that we will not get what we want.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
The third type of processes

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
that Porter highlights

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
are the management processes.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Porter comes from the fact that

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
the whole business is about interacting with people.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Therefore, management is needed,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
which will organize the main process itself,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
the main processes that are produced.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Management is needed,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
which will organize the implementation,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
interaction, functional auxiliary processes

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
that are necessary for the main processes,

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
and, accordingly, it is necessary to organize

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
the management communication here.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
In the end, management processes are needed

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
to modernize both the main processes

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
and the auxiliary ones,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
to introduce innovations,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
to introduce new innovations,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
to make new proposals and promote them on the market.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
This is the whole complexity of management processes,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
which we have already discussed.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
In principle, Porter did not say anything new.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
This was the case with Taylor and Fayol,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
and even more so in the doctrine of human relations.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
This can be traced in every strategy

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
of the management of the 20th century,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
but the main achievement of Porter

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
is that he focused his attention

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
on the need to take into account the processes.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Usually, business people

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
are focused on the result,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
but this is a general approach.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
As for the result,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
it is realized through processes,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
and these processes are constantly changing.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
And it is in these processes

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
that the feedback from the social-economic environment,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
from the social-technical environment,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
from political values,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
moral values, aesthetic values, etc.,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
are formed by the psychology of consumer needs.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Porter, proposing his process theory,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
focuses on the fact that

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
management or management system

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
leads to the result,

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
but this is a strategy.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
This is how the business process ends.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
And we need constant tactical processes,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
what is happening today, now.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
And this is where the process management is important.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
We need to manage the current processes,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
we need to coordinate the current processes,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
we need to modify the current processes,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
the connections between them,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
the dependencies between them,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
the order of everything that exists.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Porter's concept is based on

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
the fact that it has been widely developed,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and further approaches to management

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
are based on recognition

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
not only of the result,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
which is what the predecessors had,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
but also of the processes.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
In fact, Porter has leveled this connection,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
and the processes have the same meaning,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
the same meaning,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
the same meaning,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
the same attention,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
the same relevance as the results

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
that the traditional business was based on.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
And based on this process-result relationship

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
emerged about 10-15 years later,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
after Porter's process concept,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
which began to be implemented very quickly

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
and received general recognition,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
a situational approach emerged in management,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
which, on the one hand,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
pays attention to the processes

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
that are implemented in business

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
depending on the situation,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
and, on the other hand,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
considers the whole set of processes

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
related to the result.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
As for the situational approach in business,

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
it is the approach that is currently

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
being implemented in the management system,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
both in production and in the service sector,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
and which is currently

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
a working system,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
a logical conclusion

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
of all those concepts

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
that we have discussed.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
And this is the approach

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
of all those concepts

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
that we have discussed before,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
those concepts that are presented

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
on the slide that we are looking at today

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
from the point of view of the evolution

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
of management thinking in the 20th century.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
What is the situational approach to management?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
The situational approach to management

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
is based on a simple basic idea.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
There is no business at all,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
there is no business result at all,

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
there is no business process at all.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Any business, any business activity

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
is implemented by living people

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
in specific conditions,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
in specific circumstances,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
in specific means,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
in specific possibilities,

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
and it is not a business.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
In this regard, we can evaluate management,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
we can consider management,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
we can modify management as a management system

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
only in application to those specific situations

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
in which it is implemented,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
to those specific actions that take place in it.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Accordingly, what steps

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
should a manager take

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
based on the situational approach?

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
The first step is that

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
a manager should be a professional.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Remember, when we just started

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
talking about management,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
we emphasized that it is a professional activity.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The situational approach,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
as a generalization of the entire

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
historical experience of management,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
is a very broad concept.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
The situational approach,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
since it includes both quantitative

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
and personalization approaches,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
suggests that professionalism means

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
that a manager should know

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
the means of professional management.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
In fact, he should have the theory,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
the experience in management that he has developed.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
He should know the system analysis,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
the planning methods,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
the control methods,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
the quantitative methods of decision-making.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
That is, professional management today

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
is not a humanitarian who can speak well,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
but a specialist who has not only

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
humanitarian methods of presenting information,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
presentations, communication, communication,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
but also the method of psychological analysis.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
But this is a specialist who can provide

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
a mathematical quantitative justification

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
of the proposed solutions, plans,

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
and projects.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
A professional manager is a specialist

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
of a wide profile, both humanitarian

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
and, of course, mathematical.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
So, the first is professionalism.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
A manager should be able to predict

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
the possible consequences of each of his actions,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
of those or other methods,

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
of those or other approaches.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Moreover, he should predict

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
not only positive results,

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
as they say,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
we all like to do this,

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
but also possible negative consequences.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Yes, we are now increasing our share in the market,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
but will the anti-monopoly service

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
pay attention to us after that?

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Will we become monopolists?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
From the point of view of business,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
this is wonderful,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
but from the point of view of social control,

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
social contact,

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
there are other difficulties.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
The second step of the social approach

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
requires a manager

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
to be able to plan,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
organize,

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
and control the results

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
he has received.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
And, again, we work with people,

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
so we must introduce different motivational schemes.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
We need to predict

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
whether this new motivational scheme

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
will lead to difficulties

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
in achieving the final result,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
whether it will cause a conflict within the organization,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
whether it will give negative results

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
instead of positive ones.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Yes, it is difficult to predict,

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
but this is what professionalism is all about.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
This is what a professional is all about,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
and this is what a manager of experience

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
is all about.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
The next step,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
which is presented to the manager

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
in the social approach,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
is that we need to interpret the situation correctly.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
I must be able to analyze

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
the business processes that exist,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
the market analysis,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
the brand analysis,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
the development prospects,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
so that I can build the right planning

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
and organization based on this analysis.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Based on this analysis,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
I can build the controlling events

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
and the motivational schemes

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
that I will implement.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
And finally,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
the next step in the management

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
is to be able to implement specific techniques

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
that I use for the specific business.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Any novelty is always a risk.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I can already have an approach

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
that has already justified itself,

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
which brings a very good result so far.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
How much should it be changed?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
How much should it be changed?

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Now or later,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
when this approach

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
will be taken over by other companies

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
and something will need to be changed

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
in order to gain a place in the market.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
At the same time,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
all the changes in the management

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
will still lead to some deviations,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
very rarely you can change

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
the management of a company.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Very rarely it can happen

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
that we have only positive effects.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Someone will quit,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
someone will agree,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
someone will prevent the introduction of something new.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
A person is used to base on what he is already used to.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
And a person always opposes,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
opposes the new.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
How many new actions,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
how many new skills will be successful for me?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Here I am a doc,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
and I don't know what will happen next.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
These are the four main principles

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
that are implemented in the situational approach.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
As for the situational approach,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
it immerses in business,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
analyzes business,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
considers business

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
from the point of view of the broad means

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
in which it is imposed,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
both the external environment of the organization

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
and the internal environment of the organization.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Let's look at this slide.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Any organization is placed

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
in some external social conditions.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
This is a state,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
this is a city,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
these are the authorities,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
these are the legislative, executive,

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
legal norms, etc.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
But the main thing is that any organization

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
is a part of a larger system.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Based on the situational approach,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
we can say that the functionality of the system

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
depends on the adequate functioning

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
of the elements included in it.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
When we talk about an organization

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
as a system,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
we should always mean the necessary resources.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Resources that we get from outside.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
The raw materials from which we make

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
the products of the company.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
The staff, the people who work in this company,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
who bring their identity to this company,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
their identity, their specifics.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
These are directly connected

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
to the final result we will get.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
The capital we invest in the company.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
The technologies we use in the company.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Technology is a very important element

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
of any organization.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Industrial intelligence, industrial espionage

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
are aimed at learning about the changes in technology.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
To learn about the information ideas,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
the information that the company possesses.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
In terms of resources,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
any organization includes

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
a certain process of transformation.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
The work itself.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Never will a particular work

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
become a final detail

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
if it is not equipped

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
with the professional skills of the people

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
who work in it.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Management activity.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
We are talking about the fact that in order to get

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
the desired results,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
the right organization is needed.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
The right management relationship is built.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
There is a certain technological chain.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
A certain technological process

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
is tied to the final result of the production.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
There are specific goals

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
that are realized at each specific part of the production.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
In order to get the final goal,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
in order to get an Audi car,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
it is necessary to have its internal details

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
and internal parts made,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
correctly composed,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
connected and fitted to each other.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Naturally, as we have been pointing out,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
the output of any organization

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
is some goods and services

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
for which this organization is formed.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
These funds are invested

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
in order to get a profit,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
to get the investment results

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
that I make.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
And the organization

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
of the team building

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
is based on the human factor.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
It depends on the organization

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
of the human relationship,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
the motivation of the staff,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
the implementation of various

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
motivational schemes,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
the system of team building,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
the organization of the team,

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
the team building team.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
This is where the need for a certain output comes in.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And when we get the output,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
we have a very important condition

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
that is the need to maintain feedback.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Feedback that allows us

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
to see whether we are on the right track

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
and what else needs to be added

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
in order to improve

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
the outcome we get.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Naturally, at every stage

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
of the functioning of this system

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
that is immersed in the external environment,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
different situational conditions are determined.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
And in order to maintain feedback,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
we need to take into account

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
the features of the organization.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
The external environment factors include

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
environmental factors, macroeconomic factors,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
legislative, social, demographic.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
These are all the conditions

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
that are really related to the functioning of our organization.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Natural and climatic factors are also included.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Depending on whether it is sunny or rainy outside,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
my motivation also depends on this.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
If it's raining outside,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't want to go out of the warm room.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
If it's sunny outside,

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I want to go to a resort.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
I don't think about work.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
I don't want to work now.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
On the other hand,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
in addition to the external factors,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
we need to take into account

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
the players that are present in this environment.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
These are the suppliers of resources,

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
their relations,

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
whether the contracts are paid,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
how quickly they can provide me with the resources I need.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
If I suddenly need to change something,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
how satisfied are they with the needs?

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
The same applies to the suppliers of services.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Services and material production

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
are two interconnected things.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
If I need some details,

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I need to agree with the logistics company

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
about their delivery, storage, etc.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
These are the services that are closely connected

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
to the production of goods.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
It's no coincidence that we talk about

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
business in production and business in service delivery.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Naturally, we are directly connected

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
with the partners we interact with,

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
with the controlling agencies

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
that check whether we have filled in the tax documents,

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
how we have dispatched the goods, etc.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
We are directly connected to the consumers.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
In the end, the consumers are the people

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
who pay us for the products we have produced.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
If our result is the best,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
but it is not in the best condition,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
then we are not in the best condition.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
We are in the worst condition.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
If my result is the best,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
but it is not in the best condition,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
then it will be a loss for me.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
It will not bring me profit,

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
but it will bring me problems.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Therefore, we need to be able

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
to fight for the consumers.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
At the same time, there are competitors

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
for the same resources and consumers.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
In our age of information,

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
PR and advertising are of great importance.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
They interact with the media.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
The media form the preferences of the consumers,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
the relations of the consumers,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
the prejudices of the consumers,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
the priorities of the consumers,

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
the relations to certain products.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Consequently, they are the ones

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
who determine the business results

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
that we want to get

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
with the well-made production,

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
with the well-made management system.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
The media can both raise the company

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
in the open and destroy it.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
We live in a social world

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
and we have to be careful

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
about the media.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
All these factors should be taken into account.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
It is not for nothing that now

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
PR departments are being created

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
in large corporations,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
marketing departments,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
communication departments,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
advertising departments,

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
and promotion of mass media.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Yes, it is a big investment,

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
but it is not a big investment

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
that will pay off in any case

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
if the company plans to exist

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
in the market and beyond.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
As for these factors of the external environment,

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
they are presented in a clear way

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
so that you can see the connections

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
that exist, the elements that exist.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
I would also like to draw your attention

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
to the fact that these factors

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
have different meanings

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
depending on the situation

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
and the impact on the business.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Some factors directly affect

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
the results of my business,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
the profit that I get

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
as a result of the investments.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
There are also factors of indirect impact.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
If the direct impact is direct

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
and I should focus on it,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
then the indirect impact is delayed.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
It seems that today,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
right now, it does not affect

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
the functioning of my business,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
but on the other hand,

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
not taking into account these factors,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
it can lead to me being

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
in a losing or winning position

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
after a while.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
First of all, these are political factors.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Whatever we produce,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
be it toothbrushes, cars, shoes,

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
it is still based on the political conditions

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
that exist.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
If we have a stable economy

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
where the policy is directed

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
to support economic relations

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
and economic development,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
it is a favorable condition for business development.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
If we have a totalitarian economy

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
or a state-controlled economy,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
it does not always lead to positive results

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
because in this situation,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
in addition to my own business interests,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
which are obvious,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
I need to get a profit

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
and pay off the investments.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
There are also political demands

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
related to the problem of import,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
export, redistribution of financial flows,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
election problems, etc.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
These are not business factors,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
but they are factors that

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
significantly affect even the most successful business.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
The same policy implements

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
a normative legal basis for business.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
If the rules of the game change constantly,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
like in the 90s,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
where we all lived,

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
it is difficult to live by the law.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
There is always an opportunity

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
to exert pressure

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
on the business community

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
because of the changed legal norms.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
The same applies to economic factors.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
There is a stable economy,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
there is a period of social transformations,

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
there are transition periods

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
when the requirements are changed,

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
the state of accountability is changed,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
subsidies are changed,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
the number of employees is destroyed,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
the connections that have been formed

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
for decades are destroyed,

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
and the entire production system

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
and management system have to be re-established.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Not everyone is ready for this.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Let's remember the 90s in Russia,

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
the fruits of which we will reap today.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
But again, we can talk about

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
socio-cultural factors,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
the mass media has launched a campaign

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
about genetically modified products.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
A huge number of people

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
do not understand what it is.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
But this abbreviation GMO,

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
genetically modified objects,

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
is known to all old people,

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
they cannot understand what it is,

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
how dangerous it is.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
This is a socio-cultural factor.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Natural factors.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Let's remember the disasters

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
that are happening now with the weather.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
A very hot summer,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
cold winters.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
No wonder that today,

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
because the summer was harsh,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
the price of grain is changing,

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
and the price of other products

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
is increasing with all the consequences

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
that come from it.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Both social and economic.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
And of course,

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
when we talk about indirect impact,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
we should not forget about scientific and technical progress.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
As for Western business,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Western management,

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
they invest in scientific research

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
to outrun their competitors.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Because today, as we have already said,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
the profit and share of the market

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
is obtained by the one who managed

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
to bring to this market what will be in demand.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
In Russia,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
for the last 15 years,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
little attention was paid to scientific research,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
and we have hopelessly lagged behind the West.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Nevertheless,

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
today there are attempts

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
to change the picture,

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
in particular,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
we are talking about nanotechnology.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
This is what will be used by the state,

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
and this is what can be used

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
as an indirect factor in the development of business

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
in the perspective of possible investments.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
This is the situation

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
that is associated with the external impact

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
on a particular business company.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
But,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
we are talking about the fact

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
that the company,

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
in addition to external impact,

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
also has internal functions.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
This is what we have touched upon,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
starting with Fayol,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
and especially in the school of human relations.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
This is the company's mission,

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
what does the company expect?

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
To get a quick profit,

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
and then we'll see,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
or does it expect to exist for a long time,

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
and then we'll see.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
To form its own history,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
its own brands,

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
its own relations,

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
its own clients,

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
its own approaches,

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
its own structure,

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
how the staff is selected,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
how the staff is trained,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
how the staff is evaluated,

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
how the staff trajectory is formed,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
what culture exists in the company,

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
what corporate culture,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
what corporate ethics,

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
what form of clothing,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
what form of relations,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
what form of interaction and promotion

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
along the bureaucratic ladder

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
that exists in any company,

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
what strategy exists in the company,

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
does the company have a long-term strategy,

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
so that the staff knows

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
that the company is supposed to exist for a long time,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
like Japanese companies,

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
and, accordingly,

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
you can make your own development from this company.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Either this company is 7-minute,

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
or this company is for a certain period of time,

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
what structure does the company have?

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Subordination structure, department structure,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
department structure,

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
management structure that exists in it,

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
what management styles exist,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
are they authoritarian, democratic,

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
or liberal,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
in what industry does the company develop,

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
and in what area does it function,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
what kind of knowledge,

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
what kind of professionalism is needed in the company,

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
what is the stage of the organization's development,

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
is it a newly created company,

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
is it a company that has already recommended itself,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
is this company at the stage of development,

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
or at the stage of decline,

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
what is the stage of the life cycle in this company,

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
because all these are important factors of the internal environment

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
that have a significant impact on the organization's development.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
that have a significant impact on the organization's development.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
All these factors reflect the situation.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
These factors can be listed for a long time,

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
and in the literature that is offered to you,

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
other factors are described there.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
The main thing is that, of course,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
we have talked a lot about external factors,

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
but internal factors play a significant and fundamental role

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
in the organization's development,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
in the organization's management structure,

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
because there is no abstract organization.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
An organization is specific people,

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
specific managers, specific owners,

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
specific style and management system

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
that exist in this organization,

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
and with the most favorable external situation,

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
if there is no qualified staff in the organization,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
if there is no qualified management system in the organization,

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
if there is no qualified management system in the organization,

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
we cannot achieve results in the most favorable situation,

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
we cannot achieve results in the most favorable situation,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
simply because not everything is fine

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
within the organization itself.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
From this point of view,

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
in the literature there are many different approaches

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
that allow to get the most of the results.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
The most of the results

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
from the point of view of how the parameters of the organization,

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
the relationship within the organization,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
the external situation,

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
the external economic conditions of the organization

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
correspond to the situational requirements that are presented.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
As for these approaches,

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
we will consider two of them,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
but you can look at other approaches

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
in the literature that is offered to you.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
Because there are many approaches,

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
there are many models,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
and their application depends on the specific conditions,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
on the specificity of the organization,

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
and it is very difficult to offer some general schemes

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
that will be applicable in each case.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
In particular,

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Harold Leavitt was offered

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
four alternative approaches

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
that can be used to assess

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
the efficiency of the organization

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
and the degree of its prospective.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
The picture you see on the slide

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
was named the Leavitt Diamond

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
simply because the presence of solid,

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
rigid relationships

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
provides for rigid archaeological models.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
If some of their elements

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
are weak or some connection is insufficient,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
the organization collapses and collapses like a house of cards.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Diamond is a substance

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
that has the strongest structure,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
and this strength is provided

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
by the connections that exist between the atoms.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
The same thing exists between the variables

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
that are highlighted by the diamond.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The first variable is the mission of the company.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
What is the task of the company?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Is it long-term or short-term?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
What is the scope of the market sector?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
What does it want to achieve?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
After the organization's mission is determined,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
what structure exists within the organization

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
to achieve the goals set by the company?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
What is the structure of the organization?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
What are the technologies that the company owns?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
What are the competitive advantages

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that these technologies provide?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Are they outdated or innovative?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Do these technologies provide the opportunity

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
for the company to get the desired result

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
that will be in demand?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And of course,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
what is the structure of the organization?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
What is the structure of the organization?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
What is the structure of the organization?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And of course,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
the basis of everything is the personnel.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Those people who work in the organization,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
those people who realize and perform its missions,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
those people who function in the created structure,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
those people who realize any technologies.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Each of these four elements is essential

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
in terms of organizing internal business processes

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
that lead to a specific result,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
a specific service that we introduce to the market.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Almas Leavitt is a model

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that is described in such variables

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
that we can track,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
operationalize within each company

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and calculate how much of this

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
information is available

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and how well these variables are interconnected

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and how much they provide us

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
with the competitive advantages

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
in terms of achieving

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the business result that interests us.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
the business result that interests us.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
If Leavitt deals with the structure of the organization

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and its description through variables,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
then it is necessary to understand

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
that McKinsey, another researcher,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
proposed a ladder model

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
as a result of the analysis of business processes

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and all those situational processes.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It was called the McKinsey ladder

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
that shows that at any time

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
each company has some alternative development.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It is very important

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
that the business model

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and the requirements of the consumer

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
constantly change.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The business is successful

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
if it is able to catch these changes

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
and offer services, goods,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
services, goods in time

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and not to be afraid

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
of the consequences of these changes.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
The business is successful

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
if it can offer services, goods

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
that are in demand now.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The task of the managers

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
is to identify these alternatives

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
because the problem is the alternative

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
that management faces.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The performer works on a specific production,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
performs specific actions in specific conditions

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and he can be initiative in his place,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
but the manager has a common picture

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and a common situation.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
The manager determines specific strategies

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and development prospects

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
depending on which the performer's activity changes.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
As for McKinsey,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
it is based on the fact that there is a business in the present time.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
As we can see in the lower left corner of the slide.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
There is a business in the present time.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We can start from the existing competitive environment

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
and set a specific tactical task

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
to be successful in this moment,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
in this condition.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But if we think about alternatives,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
if we think about the future,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
if we think about the goals set again,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
we should consider the possibilities

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
of moving to a new competitive environment,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the possibilities of changing the market

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and analyzing the prospects

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
that are emerging in the market

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
in order to satisfy these prospects.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The business exists in a specific geographical location

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and here we should think about

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
what we can talk about

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
in terms of expanding the business.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
The opening of new production

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
in new places, new countries,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
in new cities.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
How to find out

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
in those geographical conditions

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
depending on those climate features

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
what products are in demand.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
For example, what shoes to produce

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
in the North or on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
which of them will be in demand

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and what new products can be offered.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Besides the geographical structure,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
we should pay attention to the business structure.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
There are some business interactions,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
business connections.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
On the other hand,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
we should think about merging

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
or merging with other companies,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
including them, buying those companies

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
in order to expand the market

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and take a bigger position

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
in the market environment,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
in the production environment that exists.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Again, we can analyze the existing value system

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
that exists in the company

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
in terms of the relationship

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
to the product production

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and we can think about forming

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
a new value system

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
in order to satisfy the consumer's need

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
to buy not just Indian tea,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
which was 20 years ago,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
but all modern teas that exist,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
like Karkade, Lipton,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
tea in teapots, etc.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Depending on the advertising

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
that exists, aggressive advertising,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
big media,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
consumers' needs are formed,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
as we have already discussed,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and a lot of money can be invested

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
to satisfy the consumer's needs

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and to make him buy those products

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and use those services

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
that he doesn't have a significant need for,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
but it is specially designed.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
We can consider an alternative

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
to increase sales,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
attract new consumers,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and expand the market.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
McKinsey's ladder shows

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
that business is constantly changing

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and this model allows us

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
to analyze the changes that will come

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
and to be together with the market

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
not when they will be expanded

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and everyone will stop to satisfy them,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
but in advance.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
The ability to anticipate

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
the requests that arise

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and to imagine

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
the quality of a successful business

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
that will lead you to the business elite

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
or to the business of the future

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
will be the most important thing

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
that will help us to understand

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
the change in the market

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and the change in the business.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
We have discussed two models

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
that relate to the situation

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
in business.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
There are many other models,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
but my goal is to explain

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
how to perceive the tasks

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and how to analyze and evaluate them.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
These are the circumstances

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
that relate to the situation approach.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
At this stage we have discussed

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
the key evolutionary ideas

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
of management thinking

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
that were formed

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
during the 19th century

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and that have an impact

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
on the management of today.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
At the end of our meeting

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I would like to talk about the prospects.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Yes, it is good.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We have discussed the economic approach,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
the classical approach,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
the quantitative approach,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
the systematic approach,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
and the theory of strategies.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We see that changes are constantly taking place

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and we need to react to the external environment

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
in order to get the desired results.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
What are the trends

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
in the management world?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Where can we be

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
in the current business environment

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
or work ahead of the times?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It is very difficult to make forecasts

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and to give an analysis

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
that relates to the existing business environment.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
It is because it is the area

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
that has not yet developed.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
These forecasts can be realized

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
or not.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
But there are trends

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
that are actively developing today

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and that are being addressed

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
by more and more organizations.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And significant funds are being invested

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
in order to make possible innovations

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and investments.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Today I invest funds

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
so that they bring me profit soon.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
One of the significant trends

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
in the development of management

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
today is the so-called

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
electronic or virtual business.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The wide introduction

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
of information technologies,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
the introduction of computer technology,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
the development of the Internet,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
the development of electronic communications,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
the development of telecommunications

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
led to the fact that in order to get the necessary information

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
and to organize any interaction,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it is no longer necessary

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
to constantly maintain direct contact with someone,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
to call on the phone, and so on.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Today there are a lot of tasks,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
a lot of business processes and functions

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
that can be carried out electronically.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Payments, service provision,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
search for information,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
building of interaction.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Today all this is realized

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
with the help of software

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
that is not only imaginable,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
but also virtual in terms of the use

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
of modern information and telecommunications technologies.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Today it is no longer necessary

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
to come to work.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Today it is enough to have a computer

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
and with the help of a computer

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
you can organize those or other business processes

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
that give a concrete, tangible result.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Today there are more and more organizations

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
that deal with electronic business.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
In terms of virtual stores,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
in terms of service provision,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
there is no need to look for something

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
in stores and enterprises.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
It is enough to go to the computer,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
find the services you are interested in

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
and pay for them.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Again, it is not necessary to pay in cash,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
you can pay with electronic payment methods.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And this service is delivered to your home.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
A very promising and promising business

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that is being implemented today.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
This business is not only about design

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and development of websites,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
but also about sales, training,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
remote learning.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
This is what we are doing today.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
This is also an electronic business.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You have a disk

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
and you use this disk to interact with me

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
in order to get the knowledge

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
that you need

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
in order to get more results

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
from the business you are engaged in,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
to get more profit

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
from the investments you make.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
The organization of electronic business

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
is a very broad sphere of activity

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
that is gaining billions of dollars today.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Bill Gates is the richest man on the planet,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
who made this wealth for himself

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
actually on software.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
We all use the results

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
that Microsoft has achieved.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
You can treat them differently,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
but this is a fact.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
That is why virtual business

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
or electronic business

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
is gaining more and more popularity

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
from the management point of view.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
The organization of management system is very interesting.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
How to organize the interaction and management

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
of those employees who sit on computers.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
There is a lot of literature

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
where you can learn a lot

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
from the sources I have suggested.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
This is the most promising

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
trend of the development of modern management.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Not to mention that the management system

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
can be implemented

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
with the help of electronic interaction.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Today, the same manager

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
can communicate with the help of e-mail,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
e-mails, e-mails.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
We know that a lot of organizations

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
are functioning quite successfully.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Moreover, where such a system of e-communication is implemented,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
the problem of time management

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
is solved very positively.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The manager has more time

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
not to solve specific problems,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
but to deal with strategic aspects of his business.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
This is a separate and wide area of research.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The next trend of modern management

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
is connected with the information,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
with the knowledge that people possess,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
thanks to which we get

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
the desired results of the competition.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
We have already said many times

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
that today,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
thanks to the wide development

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
of information technologies,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
information becomes material,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
which acquires value.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Moreover, each company has its own

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
important knowledge, important information,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
important technologies,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
which make up the company's specific activity,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
which make up the basis of its efficiency

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
on the market,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
thanks to which it has a competitive advantage

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
over other companies.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
In this regard,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the management of knowledge

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
has become a very serious trend in modern management.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Knowledge management is closely related

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
to the creation of so-called

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
training organizations.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The idea of training organizations

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
was introduced by Peter Senge, Chris Argyris,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
and you can read more about it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
in the literature that I have suggested.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The main idea is that

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
if an organization does not try

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
to pay attention to feedback,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
if an organization does not try

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
to reflect the changes

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
that occur in the external environment,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
and what concerns the training organizations,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
this is also a development of situational approach.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
The organization is in the environment,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
this is the first time,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and in this environment there is information

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
about the organization needed for its development.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And the organization has an internal environment

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
in which people with their knowledge are located,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
and this is the only case

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
when we invest funds in training and development,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
and not only for individual employees,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
but for all the employees of the organization,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
when the organization is able to introduce innovations,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
change either technological,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
informational, organizational,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
controlling, planning chains,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
only in this case

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
the organization will have

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
undisputed competitive advantage on the market.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It is with such qualities that the training organization has.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
You can see a comparison

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
between a traditional organization

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
and a training organization on this slide.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
This is a summarized slide

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
that shows the characteristics of the organization

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
according to the criteria that are usually applied.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
We can pay attention to the following.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
The main emphasis is made

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
on the knowledge that the organization has

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
through the people in this organization,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and secondly, on the ability to apply this knowledge,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
to receive this knowledge,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
to develop this knowledge,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
to make innovations

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
in order to achieve the goals

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
that are set by the organization.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The training organization is, in fact,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
the idea of the mid-90s,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
which today is getting more and more developed,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and to a large extent it is related to the development

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
of the virtual business itself,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
which we talked about today.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But the main thing here is that the emphasis is made on people.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It is emphasized once again that all successes

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
are based on the knowledge of the staff

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
that works in this organization,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
on the knowledge of the manager

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
whose system is represented in the organization,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
on the reflection of the achievements

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
that are on the market today,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
and on the implementation of the innovations

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
that will bring us any results tomorrow.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Another trend is the so-called

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
total quality management.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
This trend was born in the 80s,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
in the 90s of the last century.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It was born in Japan.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
This is the achievement that came to us from Japan,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
and gradually this total quality management

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
is gaining more and more popularity.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
No wonder Japanese goods

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
have become synonymous with quality.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Of course, I mean real Japanese goods,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
not the fake ones that are made for them.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Moreover, all those Chinese fake goods

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
that are made under brand labels

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
use trust, respect,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
and a certain attitude to the confidence

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
in the quality of Japanese goods

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
that they have.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So, indeed, this quality management

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
has revolutionized not only management,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
but also consumer psychology.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Because today the consumer

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
wants not just to get the goods

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
that suit him,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
but to get the goods of the appropriate quality.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Simply because it also affects

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
your social status,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
it indicates your status,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
what kind of goods you can use.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You can drive a Jeep,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
you can drive a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
These are different cars,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
but their qualities are different.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
As for the overall quality management,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
it is precisely the philosophy of management.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And the main idea of this philosophy

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
is that if you want to achieve

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
a certain quality of a product,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
you should constantly improve

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
the quality of the product.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Pay attention, you can't supply

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
a new product,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
you can supply a product

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that has been in demand for a long time,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
but the product of the appropriate quality

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
is a Japanese TV and a Rubin TV.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Both are washed,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
but for some reason we prefer

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Japanese technology, not Russian.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I just want to draw your attention to this.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Moreover, in addition to constant improvement

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
of quality,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
a quick reaction to change

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
customer needs and expectations is also necessary.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Customers want the plate to be silver,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
let's give them a silver plate.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Customers want different pictures

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
on the car.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Pay attention, today we see

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
more and more cars with these pictures.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
This is quality management

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
in the sense that we want a car.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
After all, the picture has no influence

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
on its driving qualities,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
reliability, crash tests.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But we want this car with a Jaguar

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
or someone else.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
This is a response to the demand

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
that is presented to you.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
The idea of new approaches

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
to management

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
in the framework of quality management

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
is in the concept of general quality management.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
First of all,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
the main attention is paid to the client.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
That is, the client is the one

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
around whom the market

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
and production start to rotate.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Not business results,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but the client with his needs.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Because the client pays,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
which means that the client will provide business results.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
This is a centralized business.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
We care about continuous self-improvement.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
If we release something

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
and it is sold,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
it does not mean that we can relax a little.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
We must improve what is already in demand.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Again, the important thing is

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
that when we talk about quality management,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
we focus on the process.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
We get the result.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But the process is important.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
How quickly we get this result.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
What components we use

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
to get the result.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
From the point of view of ecological purity,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
which is now a problem for all consumers.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
From the point of view of genetically modified objects,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
which we have already talked about.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Return to natural food, etc.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The production process is important.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
We can get something quickly,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
but due to the fact that more time is needed,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
it will be more qualitatively,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
which means more in demand.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
The tendency to improve quality

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
is realized by the fact that it is necessary

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
to improve the quality of everything

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
that is done by the organization.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Cars should be of the same level.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
There should be a particular parking lot.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
If you buy equipment,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
you should buy the most perfect equipment.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Despite the fact that the opportunities

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
that equipment can provide may not be in demand.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But still, from the point of view of improving

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
the quality of everything that is done by the organization,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
it is a cost of this process.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
When we talk about quality,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
it is important to talk about measurements.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Everything should be very well adjusted to each other.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
There should be no gaps in the product,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
no rounded corners, or something else.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
The product should be assembled not on a knee,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
but should be a high-tech version.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
From the point of view that everything is adjusted,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
the quality of the product should be the highest.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
This is the most important thing.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It is very important to pass the authority

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
to the workers.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The worker should feel that he is responsible

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
for the high quality of each element

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
that is made by him.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
The quality of the product depends on the quality

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
that is inside.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
The quality of the product should be the highest.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
This is a real trend.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
The workers should discuss

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
and monitor the quality of each work.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
If someone made a mistake,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
the overall quality of the product

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
that is made will decrease.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
This is the third approach

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
that is being implemented today.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
As for the management perspective,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
we have focused on three main approaches.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Of course, this does not mean

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
that there are no other directions.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
In the literature that is offered to you,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
you can familiarize yourself with other trends.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
The three that we have discussed today

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
are the most important ones.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
The first one is the management perspective.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
The second one is the management perspective.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
The third one is the management perspective.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
The fourth one is the management perspective.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Let's sum up our meeting.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
We have discussed the main categories

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and approaches that exist in the modern management.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We have discussed the main categories

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and approaches that exist in the modern management.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
We have discussed the history of the emergence

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
of management as a scientific discipline.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
We have discussed the main concepts,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
approaches and systems that exist in management.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
We have discussed their positive and negative sides.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
The main thing is that each of these concepts

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
depends on the specifics of the tasks

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
that are presented to the company.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It is pointless to look for a perfect concept

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
that will immediately give us the desired results.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It is pointless to look for a perfect concept

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
that will immediately give us the desired results.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
We need to start from the situation,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
