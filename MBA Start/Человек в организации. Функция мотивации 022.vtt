00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
The last stage is self-expression. It is not always achieved, not everyone needs it.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
For example, work that allows you to develop your abilities, your potential.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Or complex work, work that allows you to make decisions on your own.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
In principle, these are already the leaders of the higher link.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Work that allows them to make decisions on their own.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
This is like a disease, like a strong drug.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
In general, leadership is really a drug.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
The ability to solve complex problems is often fast.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Once we read with our colleagues, with managers of the higher link,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
how much time they often spend on making complex decisions.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
These are top managers.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Managers who have the right to solve strategic issues,

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
budget issues, which can be changed by a simple stroke of a pen.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Often on very serious things, after some work.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
How much time they spend.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
After thinking, many said, sometimes half a minute, sometimes one and a half.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
That is, seconds.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Literally, once I take responsibility, I made a decision.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
This is a drug, but it is very important for people of this kind.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Creative work, of course, is also a certain drug, self-expression.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
And getting new knowledge and information.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Let's go back to the IT sector.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Getting new knowledge and information is not only self-expression for them.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
This is a necessary need.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Otherwise, they just miss the market.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
That is, what will be fashionable in three years,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
they must know now and understand how to apply it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
If they find out exactly in three years,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
they will not be late for three years in competitive wrestling.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Maslow, bricks.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
All the rest are built on this brick.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Alderfer.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
He reworked the hierarchy of needs a little.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
We remember, right?

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Freud, Jung and others reworked his theory.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
Pavlov, behaviorists, reworked, added to his theory.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
The same thing here.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Brick, pyramid, brick, pyramid.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
What did he change?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
He proposed to highlight three main groups of needs.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
What are these groups?

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
In general, this theory is called, in abbreviated form, ERG.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
English abbreviation.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
In Russian, the first is existence, that is, существование.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
The second is relatedness, that is, it is an object.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I translate it simply from English,

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
because in the text you will see a slightly more scientific translation.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
And the needs of growth.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Growth is just development.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
So, existential, that is, existing needs.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
This is the satisfaction of basic needs.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
What are our basic needs?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Remember, the first is the second stage.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
The first and the second.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Physiology, air, water, food and safety.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Polyclinic, stable salary, pension, safety.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The second is social.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Belonging.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
This is the third and fourth stage.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
The third is belonging, the fourth is social.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
We establish this, we maintain significant contacts,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
connections, interact with other people.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
And these two stages are combined into one.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So, the first and the second are existential needs.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
The third and the fourth are social needs.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
And the fifth is the needs for self-expression.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Here is self-improvement, personal growth, needs.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Here he added the need for self-respect.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
What did Alderfer do?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
He simplified the Maslow theory.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
If we remember this theory,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
there are not five steps, but only three.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
From the point of view of mathematics,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
it is easier to remember three than five.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
From the point of view of content,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
it is the same, by and large.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
The next one is the Maclean theory.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
The leading role of consciousness in determining human behavior.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
How interesting!

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Here something already sounds from what we have already considered.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Conscious, unconscious.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Here is the leading role of consciousness.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
A person has three main important needs.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
What are they?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Here, with Maslow, he does not interfere.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
This is something separate, completely separate.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
In that slide, there are four theories.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Comments under his theory.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
In comparison with Maslow's theory,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
you will not find a blue highlight.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Because he really has a difference.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
What are the three important needs?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Power, success and involvement.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
Involvement, by the way, correlates with Maslow's needs.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Power, the desire to influence other people.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Self-esteem, according to Maslow.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
It sounds a little different from Maclean.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
Maybe even more rigid, more principled, more emphasized.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What kind of people are they?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Who have such needs?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
These are good orators.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
They demand high attention from others.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Leaders who call for themselves.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Leaders are energetic people.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
They attract people to themselves.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
They lead people.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Success, bringing work to a successful completion.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
People focused on the result.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Look how everything is interconnected.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
We had types of corporate cultures.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
The culture of power, the culture of achievements,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
the task, the result.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And here it is reflected.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
You can't consider motivation separately.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
A person in the company culture.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Everything is together.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Everything is interconnected.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Power, success, corporate culture,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
which chooses people who have needs in power,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
in management, in success.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And involvement.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
These are people who identify themselves with the company.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
They are involved in what is happening in the company.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
What is being done there.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
They build relationships.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
They provide assistance.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
They are ideal in communication.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
These are people who are communicative, sociable.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Everyone is absolutely interesting to them.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
These are the three interesting needs that Maclean highlighted.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
They are worth considering.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And the theory of two factors.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
This is the theory of Herzberg.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
The theory was created based on interviews

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
taken at various workplaces in different professional groups

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and in different countries.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
The interviewers were asked to describe the situation

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
in which they felt complete satisfaction

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
and, on the contrary, dissatisfaction with their work.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
The interviews were really interesting.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I imagine what the difficult surveys were,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
how difficult it was to bring them together

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and to draw some results.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
He successfully did it and drew the theory of two factors.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
The answers were classified into two groups.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Studying the collected material,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Herzberg came to the conclusion

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
that satisfaction and dissatisfaction with work

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
are caused by various factors.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The motivating factors are motivators.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
The feeling of satisfaction from work is career growth.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Responsibility, positive assessment of achievements,

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
work content, work as a main motivator.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And the factors of the working conditions are hygienic factors,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
dissatisfaction with work,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
increased salary compared to competitors.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't like it because I know that

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
competitors pay more for the same work I do.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Indeed, everyone is watching each other.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
We need to pay attention to this.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
There is no secret in the market.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Although everyone is very careful about their salaries,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
we have a very good information leak.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Benefits, social status, guarantees

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and influence on personal life.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
This has become very popular in recent years.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
It is called life and work balance.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
That is, the balance between work and personal life.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Many companies take this balance

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
between work and home as a value

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
in their values, in their guidelines.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
They guarantee their employees this unique balance.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
They don't have to work until death.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
They don't have to work for years,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
but for an intense period of time.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Sometimes people need to sleep,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
go to visit, rest, spend the evening with friends.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
That is, it is already indecent to work in the duodera.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
It is wrong, ineffective.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
This is where this life and work balance comes from.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
It is also interesting, it is from the two-factor theory.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
In order to effectively motivate subordinates,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
the manager must understand the essence of the problem.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
The essence of the problem in the process.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
That is, if the theory that we just talked about,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
four, the basic subject of the Maslow's,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
were called substantive,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
then the next theory that we will talk about

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
is the process theory of motivation.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
There are substantive content,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
certain needs and process.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
A person invests his work,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
certain efforts,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
which depend not only on his needs,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
but on certain aspects of the working situation.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
A person distributes efforts to achieve various goals

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
and chooses a specific type of behavior.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
The process theory of motivation

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
considers the influence of these two factors

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
on the behavior of a person.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
There are three basic process theories of motivation.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What are they?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The theory of expectation.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
The presence of an active need is not the only and necessary condition.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
How interesting, the presence of a need is not the necessary condition for motivation.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
The theory of justice.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
And the model of Porter-Lowler.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
We will talk about them later.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
The theory of expectation.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
The essence.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
Why does a person choose a certain line of behavior?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
The theory of expectation of Viktor Vrum

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
is based on the fact that

11:54.000 --> 12:05.000
active needs are not the necessary condition

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
for motivation of a person to work.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
What are the keys to this theory?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
The result, validity and expectation.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
What is the result?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
What are the keys?

12:25.000 --> 12:33.000
The result is anything related to the need of behavior at work.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
For example, stress.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
I am stressed because I got paid at work.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Respect from colleagues.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
This is related to the need and the consequence of behavior at work.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Validity.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Subjective satisfaction with the result.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Subjective.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And expectation.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Expectation of successful performance of the task

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
under the condition of applying the appropriate efforts.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
I apply efforts and expect a reward.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
These are my efforts and my expectations for a reward.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
Employees form expectations regarding the results of their behavior

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
using preliminary experience.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
They decide whether it is possible or not to do something meaningful for them.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Let's take a salesman as an example.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
He is a successful salesman.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
He thinks that if he makes more than 9 deals per week,

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
and his percentage depends on the quantity and volume of the produced product,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
he will get a reward.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
It is likely that he will make a few more calls to potential buyers.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It is likely, if he is motivated.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
But when a salesman thinks that the product is well used,

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
that additional sales transactions will not change the result,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
that there will be no reward,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
that he can leave work in the afternoon for additional efforts,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and so on,

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
will he make additional efforts?

14:26.000 --> 14:36.000
If a person is 100% sure that his additional efforts will lead to additional expectations,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
that is, they are realized,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
that he made efforts and his expectations were met,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
then he will do it.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
He will satisfy his needs and he will work effectively.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
If he is not sure, he will not work effectively.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
The theory of justice.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
The main postulates of this theory.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Employees evaluate their relationships by comparison.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
The theory of justice is one of the most effective theories.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We always look in the neighbor's pocket.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Always.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
And rarely when we compare something other than salary.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I am in marketing, he is in marketing.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
We do the same thing.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I think so.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
We do the same thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
He thinks it can be different.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
He does better, more, more qualified.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Subjective approach.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I have my own subjective approach.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
The theory of justice.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Since we are in the same position,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
because our position is called Aditakov,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
marketing manager,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
we must get the same salary.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
To be fair.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
If I do not see justice,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I am not satisfied,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
then I will try to restore this justice.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I will hire my manager,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
raise my salary.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
What should I do to get a raise?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Sidor in another department gets other money.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
There are two options.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Either I will be fired or I will get a raise.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Until people start to think

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
that they get a fair reward,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
they will try to reduce the intensity of work.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
While I go to my manager to get a raise,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
what is my efficiency?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It is close to zero.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
I am effectively engaged in the theory of justice

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
towards myself, my beloved.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But not in terms of efficiency of my work.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
By the way, about salaries.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Salary reviews in large companies

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
are held twice a year.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
IT specialists compare themselves

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
with IT specialists in the market,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
banks with banks, etc.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Now more and more professional companies

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
make such reviews.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Hey Group, which offers these reviews,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
has been launched.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Watson White is a global supplier of salary reviews.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
More and more industries are included

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
in this review on the Russian market.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
They hold this review twice a year.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
It is very useful for employers.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Because you can always tell your employees,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
my dear, I have an official document

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
that says that I pay you more than the market.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
You will have good arguments.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
The other question is whether he will calm down

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
after this or not.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It all depends on the person.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
But it is always good to have such an argument on the table.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Porter-Lowry model.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
The model contains features,

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
both the theory of expectation and the theory of justice.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
As usual, the picture is the same,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
just a slightly different topic,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
but the very same.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
The basis is the subject,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
and they argue with it, improve, finish.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The same here.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
What have they changed in these two theories?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And what have they come to?

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Lyman Porter and Edward Lowler

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
have developed a complex process theory of motivation,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
including elements of the theory of expectation

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
and the theory of justice.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
What are the five variables they have laid down as a basis?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
These are the efforts,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
the perception,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
the results,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
the reward itself

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
for all this above-mentioned

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
natural satisfaction.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I spent effort,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
my perception was that I am so effective,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
so irreplaceable in general,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I have phenomenal results,

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
well, in principle, the reward suits me,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
but suddenly I find out

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
that Vasya Vasichkin from the neighboring department

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
got a reward of $100 more than me.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
So my satisfaction level will be zero,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
and all my efforts from the previous four points will be reduced to zero,

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
because the theory of justice will just rumble in me,

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
and the theory of expectation will melt like smoke.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
The results achieved depend on the efforts,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
abilities, characteristic features,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and the realization of one's role.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
The level of effort is determined by the value of the reward

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and the degree of confidence,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
the degree of confidence is very important,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
that this level of effort

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
will really bring with it

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
a certain level of reward.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
Where misunderstandings can occur,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
misunderstandings,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
it is really the efforts spent and the results obtained.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
It seems to me that my boss thinks differently,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
so my reward is like this,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
it is not what I expected.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And in this theory, of course,

20:15.000 --> 20:23.000
a certain ratio is established between the reward and the results.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
And this ratio is very important to calculate correctly,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
to position it correctly,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
and to convey it correctly to the employee.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
If you want to get this kind of bonus,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
describe clearly what it should do and how.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
And at each stage, what result do you expect from it?

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
Then he will consider that he got it fairly

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
or he did not get it fairly.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
Because, as a rule, we have to explain when a person has not received it.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
When he received it, in principle, there are no questions according to his expectations.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Then it will be easier for you to explain to your employee

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
that the theory of his expectations, your theory of justice,

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
are in full correlation with each other

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
and there should be a complete mutual understanding

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
that if he had made more efforts in these and these places,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
then his expectations in terms of reward would be justified to a greater extent.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
Let's continue the conversation about the model of Porter-Lowler.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
They explained the motivation mechanism as follows.

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
The results achieved by the employee depend on three variables.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
1. The efforts spent.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
2. Abilities.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
3. Characteristic features of a person.

21:56.000 --> 22:08.000
And here consciousness plays its role in this process of achieving the result.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
So, the efforts spent, abilities and characteristic features of a person.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Speaking from the employee's point of view,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
what does the employee always take into account?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
The efforts spent.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And what does the supervisor take into account, comparing the employees?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Only the efforts spent? No.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Abilities.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
One is more capable than the other.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Or one has one ability, the other has another.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Someone is very motor,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
and starts the project easily.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
But in order to continue the project,

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
to do routine work, for example, documentation,

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
one needs people with different abilities and characteristics.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
For example, if you have cholera at the beginning,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
then you have bloodsuckers and melancholics.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
Therefore, the characteristic features of a person play a very important role in achieving the results.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Hence, some people are more successful and achieve greater results,

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
others are less successful and achieve less results.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
Is it necessary that those who achieve less results are not in their place,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
do not do their job,

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
and in general, should we ask whether it is possible to change them to more successful ones?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The question is complex.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Maybe.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Or maybe not.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Because not all people can be equally successful.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
And not every person can be equally successful from year to year.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
There are always ups and downs for every person.

23:57.000 --> 24:05.000
And one more interesting point to pay attention to.

24:05.000 --> 24:14.000
The level of effort spent depends on the value of the reward.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
And on how much a person believes in this connection between his or her expenses and efforts

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and the possibility of receiving this reward.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
A very important remark.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
The value of the reward.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
If a person is not interested in his or her 100$ bonus,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
because it is not money for him,

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
he will not spend the maximum of his efforts very effectively.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
If the 100$ bonus is a matter of life and death,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
the result will be completely different.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
If the value of the reward is not money,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
but, for example, if a person does it,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
he will have prospects for career growth,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
up the ladder.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And for him this value

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
will be extremely effective.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
If he does not have such a goal,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
he does not want to make a career,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I met many such people,

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
because they are interested in developing at a professional level.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
By the way, salaries are also moving in two directions.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Here we have a career vector and a vector of professionalism.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
If before the higher the manager in the position, the more salary,

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
now colossal salaries are paid by professionals.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
For this, you do not need to occupy a high position in management,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
it is enough to be a professional in your field, a guru,

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
to get more than a top manager.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
That is, the value of the reward.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
If a career prospect opens up for me,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
and I am interested in it,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I will work.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
If not, then no.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
And it is very important to determine

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
what other achievements,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
requirements, levels of the result,

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
can actually attract internal rewards.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
What else is important for a person?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
We have already talked about the award.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
We have already talked about the praise,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
promotion in the service.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
That is, if I am awarded for my efforts throughout the campaign,

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
then yes, I think that such a goal is worthy of my efforts.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Here is such a model,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
combining the theory of expectation with the theory of justice.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
It was created, by the way, very interesting.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Again, it is applicable.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
How many people, how many theories,

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
how many theories, how many different adherents of one or another approach.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Actually, each model is interesting,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
applicable in practice.

27:01.000 --> 27:10.000
I think that some of the listed things we have studied today,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
you will take to arms,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
you have already used something,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
you will use something.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
In any case, these are existing models,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
they work and are applied in practice in companies.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
In conclusion, we will talk a little,

27:28.000 --> 27:35.000
we will summarize and talk about what we have studied today

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
and how we can use it.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
The first questions are probably those

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
that the head of any link should ask himself.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
On motivation.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
After listening, analyzing the whole material,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
think and ask yourself,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
what do my subordinates need?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Here are two directions.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
The first one.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
What do my subordinates and the list need?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
What do they need?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
For example, more attention from the head,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
that is, from me.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Pay attention to details,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
to some informal groups,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
that is, to determine what is interesting for them.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Probably, use an annual interview for this,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
or just talk to people,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
arrange a meeting, discuss.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
The second step that prompts this question,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
the second option is

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Do I know what they need at all?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Maybe you know and will quickly write a list.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Or you didn't think about it at all.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Do they need something?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
They get paid, what else do they need?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Everything is fine.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Think about it.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
In what world are the needs satisfied

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
during the activities

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
aimed at achieving the goals of the organization?

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
That is, your organization has some goals

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and there are people.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
And how much these goals and needs of people

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
who work in the organization are satisfied?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
If people are satisfied,

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
it is clear that the organization will achieve these goals.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Another question.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
If the satisfaction of work

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
and productivity of subordinates has increased,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
why did this happen?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Good question, really.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
And if they did not grow, why did it happen?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
When they grew up,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
they usually ask

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
why the efficiency of your department has fallen.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Answer me quickly. Why?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And they never ask so strictly,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
why are you so effective?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Interestingly, in my practice,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
there were several cases

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
when Western managers asked managers

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
why they had such big sales this year,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
even with a claim in the voice.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The completely broken manager said,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
what do you not like?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
We sell so much more than planned.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
A very reasonable answer.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
You had the wrong budget.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You lowered the budget.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
The budget should be different.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
If the budget was not 100, but 120,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
and the implementation is 125,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
then the bonus would be only 5%

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
for the re-implementation of the budget of 120.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Otherwise, it turns out 25,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and the budget is 100.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Everything is interconnected.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And not always very effective work

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
can please the management.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Somewhere it will be exciting

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
when the organization is formed,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and somewhere it will not.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Something was really wrongly planned.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
When you ask questions,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
other questions arise reasonably.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
How to measure the results of work?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Can you measure it?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
How can you measure it?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And if you can measure,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
how to give them an assessment,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
and how often should you give an assessment?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And how much we have succeeded

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
in achieving our goals.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And if we have not advanced enough,

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
then we know why and what to do

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
so as not to fail next year in business,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
and not to be out of the market at all,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
not to leave it,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
not to lose a piece of your market,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
your interest, your margin.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
These questions are very correct.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And really, to measure the result of work,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
yes, it is finance, but it is not only finance.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Remember, we talked about

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
when the depth of the hierarchy,

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
the depth of the structure is studied,

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
then the question of the organizational health index arises.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
The health index and surveys

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
help us measure the result of work,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
the motivation of the staff,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
and the assessment of the work of people.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
All these things,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
all these surveys, reviews,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
give us an opportunity to see

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
a picture of all our victories and defeats.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
And it gives us a good opportunity

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
to analyze what we need to do,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
how to act correctly,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
or at least where to look for answers

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
to these very difficult questions.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
And the questions that often depend on them

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
are whether to live or not to live in the company,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and whether to continue in the market.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
The next group of such, in general,

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
is no longer questions, but advice,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
although, probably,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
you can still say information for reflection.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Some advice on satisfying social needs of the staff.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Now we will repeat a little

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
what we have managed to study.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Remember, social needs.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
This is the third, fourth stage in the Maslow's Pyramid.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
So, in order to satisfy these needs of the staff,

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
what do you need to do as a manager?

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Give the employees a job

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
that would help them communicate.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
That is, if you see that you have employees

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
who have a strong need,

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
that is, it is important for them as air,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
as the first physiological thing.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
For them, communication is air.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Try to find an application for them.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
Maybe they will be engaged in corporate newspapers.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Maybe they will be engaged in corporate trips,

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
even in the organization of some insurance, something else.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Maybe, even if it is optional,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
maybe it is not even necessary,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
he does his job,

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
but it will give him an opportunity to express himself.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
Create a team spirit.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
We have already talked about team building.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It is really important.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
Of course, hold meetings with your employees.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
It is very important to inform your employees

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
about what is happening in the company.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Why is it important?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It gives you an opportunity,

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
in addition to satisfying the social needs of your staff,

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
to understand the feedback,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
what worries them, what bothers them,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and to prevent rumors.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
This is also a very interesting topic.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Rumors in the organization are sometimes created on purpose,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
sometimes they are cultivated.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
This is a completely separate topic.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
But they also need to be controlled.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
They also need to be controlled,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
they also need to be kept on the pulse.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
These meetings will help to manage these things.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Do not try to destroy the existing informal groups.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
Unless, of course, they bring some negative component to the organization,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
or do not cause damage.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It is not worth it.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
On the contrary, take the most out of this benefit.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
And, of course, create some conditions for the members of your organization

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
outside of its framework.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Corporate parties, for example.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
A great option.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Satisfaction of the needs in respect of the staff.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
How can this be done?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Offer subordinate more substantive work.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
For example, without adding a deposit,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
without changing the position,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
just say,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
seeing that a person has such a huge rush,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
say, listen, I need help.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
Help in this direction, in this project.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Can you help?

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Your knowledge is irreplaceable.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
We respect you.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Your level is very important.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
The person will be happy.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
If a person has this need, he will be happy.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
He will gladly go and do everything there.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And will be satisfied.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
And will not require a reward,

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
because the reward for him is the respect and trust he has.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
This is already a reward.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
Provide your employees with a positive feedback

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
on the results achieved.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Remember, we talked about the fact that there is a knot,

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
a gingerbread, a reward and a punishment.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And that it is better to refuse punishment.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Right.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
It is better to encourage.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I encouraged these people.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
I would like to encourage others too.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
They will try.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
What are they worse at?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
They also want to be good.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Attract your employees to make decisions.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Trust and respect.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Consult.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Learn their opinion.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Often they can suggest the perfect options

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
to get out of some difficult situations.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Often they seem to be dead ends.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Our people are very smart, talented and creative.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
When you ask them why they are silent,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
they say that no one asked.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Ideas are amazing.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
And, of course, there is a tendency to delegate

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
to those who have additional rights and powers.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
And, of course, they will ask you for your responsibilities.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
If I trust you, delegate, I will ask you.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
You will answer me.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I will not cover you, but you will answer me.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Not for me, but for yourself.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
As a manager, I am responsible for all the mistakes of the department.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And the manager who says that he is not a fool

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
will never say that.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He will say that he is to blame.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Because you are the manager, you are paid.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
As a manager, you must take all the risks.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
But this delegation...

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
It is clear that if something goes wrong,

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
the manager will be punished for the project he lost.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Even for delegating.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
But you must be able to take this blow.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This is professionalism.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
And another important point.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
If there is an opportunity to promote employees on the career ladder.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Again, the hierarchy in the company.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
22 steps, 6 steps.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
You can promote more, you can promote less.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
But you can promote inside the steps.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
Remember, we just talked about the career ladder up and professional.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
A professional can be a junior, senior, a leader, a guru.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Let's say, we have already drawn several steps on this flat line.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
There is such an opportunity to promote.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Even if it is a ladder, but still a certain career ladder.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
And the salary, of course, also depends on it.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
And training is a great motivator.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
Training, people raise their level, competence, qualification and communicate.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
By the way, training can also be attributed to the satisfaction of socialization needs.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
During training, if people from different departments are mixed,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
they often even get to know each other.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
After working for several years in the company, they do not know each other,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
because they have never had to touch.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
The needs in self-expression of the staff.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
How to satisfy them?

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Provide the subordinates with the opportunity to learn and develop.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Look, the learning and development with a red thread goes through all the needs.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
We respect you, we trust you, we teach you.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
We believe that you are loyal, we believe that you will not leave us.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
We invest money in you, we count on you.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Socialization.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
You can communicate with people, you can show yourself, look at others, compare.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Self-expression.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
During training, you can show yourself, you will be noticed,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
maybe we will look at you with different eyes.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
Training is a very motivating factor from different sides.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
The main thing is to use it correctly.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And the results of training.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
Give the subordinates a difficult job, requiring full return from them.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
This is a great trust and, of course, a colossal self-expression of people.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Because something new is absolutely for them,

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
mobilizes and they are more effective.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
Not only what they did routinely, but this is what captures them,

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
again, those who are motivated by it.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
And to learn, to develop creative abilities in every possible way.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
If the company has the opportunity, to direct these people to some different projects.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
Well, that's all for today, dear colleagues.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
I hope that your time was not wasted in vain.

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
In any case, I really hope that all the material that we discussed with you today

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
will be useful to you and that the lecture was interesting.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
It seems to me that I will not make any special recommendations

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
on reading books and literature on this topic.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Because, again, I repeat, read the sources.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It is very interesting.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
Actually, it will be your communication with the author.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
If we remember Munchausen, then remember when he said,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
I communicate directly with Shakespeare.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
Please, communicate directly, if you are interested, with Freud, Maslow, with other theorists.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
Because, probably, this will be the most correct communication,

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
not through the prism of someone else's perception.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
It will be only you and only the person who was the founder of the theory.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And, of course, I advise you to read the founders.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
Because everyone else worked on it, reworked it,

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
but in any case, the basis was laid by some specific theorist.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
So, start working with him, if he is interesting for you.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
And, in principle, all the knowledge that you have received today

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
will be more than enough for you as managers

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
in order to, first of all, look at yourself,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
at what kind of person you are, in what company you work,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
what style of management you have,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
how you work with your subordinates,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
whether you know how to motivate them, whether you know how to listen to them,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
how you recruited your staff,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
how you plan your employees' career growth.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
That is, all those aspects that are very important, vital factors for your subordinates,

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
for your employees, and for you in relation to your management.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Thank you very much for your attention.
