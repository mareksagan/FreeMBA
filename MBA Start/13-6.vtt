00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Good afternoon, my name is Oksana Samarina, I am the head of the Kovacheng department at the Moscow Business School.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
So, I would like to say a few words about myself.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I have been working in the field of training and development of staff for many years.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
I was engaged in training, individual consulting, everything related to training staff, assessment.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
And now I have switched to coaching.

00:34.000 --> 00:43.000
Coaching is probably a well-known word for many, but I would like to clarify it a little.

00:43.000 --> 00:56.000
Today, at our lecture, I would like to discuss such blocks as what coaching is, what method is it, how we can apply it in our practice,

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
what is coach management, how to implement it at our enterprise, and what benefits we will get in this regard.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Next, I would like to discuss such a topic as coaching in the implementation of organizational changes.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
And move on to the topic of how to plan and set goals that will follow organizational changes.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
And also a very important point is how to conduct coaching.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Coaching of the subordinate and coaching of the manager.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
These are the main blocks that we will study today.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Coaching

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
So, the first one. What is coaching?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
The word is quite well-known.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Surely, many have heard about it and even, perhaps, tried it somehow.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But nevertheless, what is it?

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
In fact, there is no definition of coaching.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Each author tries to do it in his own way.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Each author tries to introduce something of his own into the definition of this name.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Nevertheless, each of those who tries to do it agrees on one thing.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Namely, coaching is a method that helps to determine and achieve goals in the best way.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
This is a method that focuses on the result, on getting this result and on striving for the goal.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
This is the most important thing.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
There are also many definitions that are quite cumbersome, which may not be quite understandable.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
But nevertheless, I would like to emphasize one thing.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
This is a method of determining and achieving goals.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And with minimal effort to achieve the maximum results.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
And now I would like to talk to you about how to build a relationship in coaching.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
How to build a relationship between a coach and a nurse?

03:06.000 --> 03:18.000
After all, it is really very important, in fact, if a coach has confidence that every person has a huge potential.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
That every person is a creator and he already has the maximum opportunities.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
This is a very important coach's confidence.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Without this confidence, you probably should not even do coaching.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And then.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
A very important point is mutual trust between the coach and his nurse.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
Because if there is no mutual understanding, if there is no trust between these two people, then the coaching process will not work.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
It will be anything but coaching.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
Moreover, it is very important that if the coach and his nurse interact, there should be mutual trust between them.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
This is necessary.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And another very important point.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
After all, coaching is not a direct approach.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
This is a rather soft style.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
And for the manager, for the coach, maybe not everyone will like it.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
Rather, it is a very important and valuable quality of a coach, which is external in the organization.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Or it is a coach who works inside the company and supports this style.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
The style of non-directivity.

04:36.000 --> 04:46.000
And another very important point is that in coaching, a professional coach does not give advice.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
He guides and asks questions.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
But in no case is he an expert.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
There is such a direction as expert coaching, which we will talk about in the future.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
But nevertheless, I would like to emphasize once again that a coach is not the one who gives advice.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
This is not the one who gives instructions.

05:07.000 --> 05:17.000
This is the one who listens to you and asks special questions in order to clarify the goal that is important for you.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
To outline certain steps and ways to achieve this goal.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Next, I would like to point out that in coaching we do not focus on problems.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
We are talking about tasks.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
This is a big and fundamental difference.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Because coaching is aimed at the action now, at the action in the future.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
And in no case at how it was in the past.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
Remember, we live now and we think about how we will achieve our goals in the future.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
Therefore, a very important point is that the focus is on the present and the focus is on the future.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
And here it is very important for us that we do not think about what mistakes we made before.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
We forget what we did or did not do before.

06:11.000 --> 06:23.000
The focus is on the goal and the focus is on what we can do to improve our activity and to achieve the goal that we strive for.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
It happens very often that the nanny says,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't want to be late for work anymore.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
I don't want to watch my subordinates not doing their job anymore.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And when you ask the question, what do you want?

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
Then the answer is again, I don't want my subordinates to behave this way.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay, what do you want?

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
And then the coaching begins, when the manager says, I want them to come on time.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
This is the focus on the task.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
We focus on the problem, on what I don't want.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And we focus our attention on the task.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What do I want?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
What do I want to achieve?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
What task do I want to solve?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And what goal do I want to achieve?

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Another very important principle of coaching is confidentiality.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
If the coach is working with his client,

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
then there must be a 100% guarantee that all the information that the coach received from his client,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
from his subordinate, will remain between them.

07:38.000 --> 07:48.000
Unless it was discussed in advance that any parts of the information provided to the coach can be disclosed to the client.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Otherwise, there is no way.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
That is, our rule is this, compliance with absolute and complete confidentiality.

07:56.000 --> 08:07.000
Only in these conditions can our client, our subordinate, be absolutely sure that he can tell us everything he wants.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
And he can be absolutely calm that it will remain between him and the coach.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
This is, you know, similar to the relationship of friends.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Because when I trust a friend with some important information,

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
I want to be sure that this information will remain between us and that no one else will find out about it.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That is why I can trust him.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Our task is to become the same friends at this moment for our subordinate,

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
so that he opens up and has the opportunity to trust us completely.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And he was absolutely sure that absolute confidentiality was guaranteed to him.

08:45.000 --> 08:54.000
So, we, professional coaches, use the concept of basic coaching in our work.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What is it?

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
We are deeply confident that every person has a very great potential.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
So great that sometimes it is even difficult to realize what we can and what we can.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
But nevertheless, what prevents us?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
These are obstacles.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
And not so much external obstacles, but rather internal ones.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
This is some kind of uncertainty, this is fear to act.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
It is possible, on the contrary, to like the aspiration, to make an impression,

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
which at a certain moment can block our abilities.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
Remember when fear blocked your knowledge at the same exam or at the same test?

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Remember when you wanted to make some great impression, and suddenly it didn't work out?

09:46.000 --> 09:55.000
It's just that your potential was lower than usual due to the fact that you felt internal obstacles.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
So, the goal of coaching is to minimize these obstacles and maximize potential.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
To increase potential by reducing obstacles, both internal and external.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
What do we mean when we say external obstacles?

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
External obstacles can be elementary, at work, if so.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
I can't move up the career ladder because I don't have an education or something else.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
But all these issues are quite solvable and all these obstacles can be overcome.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
And a coach has the right to instill this confidence in his subordinate.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yes, you can overcome it.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
Yes, it is such an obstacle that may seem difficult now, but in the future you will definitely overcome it.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
And now I would like to draw our attention to the slide on which we could see the coaching results.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Let's take a look at it.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
So, the companies that ordered coaching for their managers noted improvements in performance,

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
in quality, strengthening of the organization, in customer service,

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
reduction of customer complaints, lack of current managers,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
reduction of costs and overall profitability.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
You can continue to read this slide.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And we move on to the next material.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
So, what are the goals of coaching?

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
We have already discussed what coaching is and what are its goals.

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
The goal of coaching in a company, in business processes, is, first of all, to achieve the result.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
To achieve the goal, the one that was initially stated.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
It is very important for us to understand that there are goals, there are goals for goals,

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
and in each goal there are certain small goals that we must pass in order to get to the desired state.

12:03.000 --> 12:12.000
There is a desired state and there is a starting state from which we want to move to the desired state.

12:12.000 --> 12:21.000
The goal of coaching is to help a person move from where he is now to where he wants to be.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The same is true for a company.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
A company that wants to move to a new high-quality state,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
that wants to make certain changes,

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
invites a coach to stimulate these changes,

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
to achieve the result that it would like.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And so we can summarize.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
A coach does not give advice.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
A coach will not tell you what, how and in what order to do it.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
A coach is not the person who will come to your company,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
do everything himself and you will only have to reap the fruits.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Rather, not like that.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Let's remember Socrates.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
He said that he was a money-grubbing grandmother of knowledge.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
I can help you to learn, but I cannot force you to do it.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
The same is true here.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
Coaching is very close to the expression of Socrates.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
A coach can contribute to the education and development,

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
but he cannot do this development and education for you.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
He can stimulate you, he can cheer you up,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
he can motivate you,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
he can develop a plan and control of all these actions with you.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
But the actions will be for you.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
For the person who turned to the coach

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
or for the company that turned to the coach to make changes.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Let's talk about the development in coaching.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
In fact, the goal of coaching is the resultiveness of achieving the goal.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And yet, what else is going on?

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
Coaching allows you to develop awareness, responsibility and self-confidence.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Let's imagine,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
only what we are aware of, we can control.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Only what we take responsibility for is our decision.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
This is the decision that we have made for ourselves and that we are obliged to fulfill.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
It often happens that the head assigns certain tasks to his subordinates,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
and he ignores them.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Why? Why doesn't he take responsibility for himself?

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
And he can take responsibility only when he is internally agreeable with this decision,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
when he himself wants to fulfill it,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and then he will do it in the best way.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And this is one of the tasks of coaching.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
To make a person take responsibility for the task assigned to him

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
and to fulfill it in the best way.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
Another important point that we also talked about is the development of self-confidence.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
Only a person who is confident in himself is capable of great achievements.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
A person who realizes his resources,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
who realizes his goals,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
who takes responsibility for his achievements,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
is really a person who can achieve his goals

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
and who is stimulated and inspired by these goals

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
and makes this path to the goal attractive.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
This is also motivation.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
That's why I would like to stop at the moment

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
what is coaching and who is a coach?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And how is it different from the rest?

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Coaching is a method that came to us from sports,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
from sports training.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
In English, it means coaching.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
It is individual coaching.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Coaching is to achieve a certain result.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
A coach can be called a coach,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
but this concept is much broader.

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
And that's why the word coaching is not translated into Russian.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
In our Russian language, we have not yet come up with a term

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
that could replace the word coaching.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Coaching is not mentorship.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It is not mentorship.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It is not coaching.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
It is exactly coaching.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
This is the coaching that we have just discussed.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
This is a method that allows you to determine and achieve goals.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
It is a coach who stimulates you to achieve these goals.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
It is a coach who inspires you to achieve these goals.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
But he does not give advice.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
If it is an external coach,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
if it is an internal coach who works with the manager.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
We will also talk about the topic

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
when a coach is a manager

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
and how he can build this coaching interaction.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
So, coach management.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Our next topic.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
Let's think about how it differs from just management.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Management is management.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
And what is coach management?

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
First of all, the basis of coach management is

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
that questions gradually come to replace the directives.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
Or it is a combination of directions with additional questions.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
When a manager gives a task to a subordinate,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
one of his tasks is to check

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
how true his subordinate understood this task.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
How much resources he has now

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
in order to complete this task.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And what can help this subordinate

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
to approach this task even more responsibly,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
with even more full return.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
So, coach management is based on the fact

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
that more and more questions should come to replace the directions.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
And we mostly ask open questions in coaching.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
You know the difference between open and closed questions.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Open questions are those

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
that are unlikely to be answered unambiguously.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Open questions stimulate.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
Open questions encourage to give a detailed and full answer.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
They stimulate us to think and be active.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
So, let's summarize.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
What does a coach do?

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
First of all, he gives a task to his subordinate

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
and asks questions.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
How clear is the task?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Does the subordinate have all the resources

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
and necessary funds to complete this task?

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
How does the subordinate plan to complete this task?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
And what is the deadline?

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Of course, there should be good and wonderful interaction

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
and trust between the coach and his subordinate.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
Otherwise, the coach will not get a sincere answer from the subordinate.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
If there is trust in the relationship

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
between the coach and the subordinate,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
then by giving the task to the subordinate

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
and asking him about the results

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
and how much it is feasible for him,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
the coach can get the following answer.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I don't have the resources now.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
I don't quite understand this task.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
If the coach can clarify his task,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
if he can give the opportunity to this person

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
to find time to complete the task,

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
then most likely the task will be successful.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
I want to emphasize once again

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
that only in the relationship of trust

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
between the coach and his subordinate

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
it is possible that this process will go smoothly

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
and the goal will be more effective.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
The task of any coach, including the coach,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
is to maintain control,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
that is, to control how the task is performed,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
to highlight certain points

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
after which the subordinate should receive feedback

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
and talk about the progress in this project.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
It is perfectly clear that the coach

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
should perform his functions,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
issue orders,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
use questions and control the activity.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
These are the necessary conditions.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
So, the coach manager should have an adequate idea

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
whether his subordinate is ready for the coaching.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
If we are talking about the coaching,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
we will see that there are newbies

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
who come to our organization

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
and who most likely need to receive instructions.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
They want to be told and shown what to do.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And most likely for such people

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
it is necessary to have a coach.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And this is a very important point.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
The coach should be able to give the necessary feedback

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
and to tell what needs to be done.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
And most likely for such people

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
coaching is not quite appropriate.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
For them, a tool such as instructions,

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
explanations and mentorship will be more suitable.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
It will be very good if a person has a mentor

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
who will take him to his position step by step,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
tell him and show him what to do

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
in the conditions of this organization.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And then his work will be successful.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
There are other types of employees.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
For example, an employee who is already a specialist.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
He already knows the working conditions well enough,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
he already does a lot on his own,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
he is already motivated enough to work,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
and he can already apply coaching methods.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
In order to specify what he can do even better,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
how he can improve his activity.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And here the task of the manager is to control

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
and direct this employee

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
in order for him to reach a new level of his development.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Develop in this organization,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
realizing his resources, his advantages,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
and working on his disadvantages.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And the third category of employees

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
is the employees who are already experienced.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
These are, so to speak, old-timers

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
who have been working in this organization for a long time,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
and they are probably already occupying

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
high positions.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
They understand and know the whole structure of the organization.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Coaching of setting goals will be relevant for them.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
After all, it is from how well the goal is set

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
and how consciously and planned the goal is,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
that success depends.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And you know, I just had this idea.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Ivan Tsarevich is walking in the desert.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
He is walking for a long time,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
he is tired, he wants to drink.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And suddenly he sees a lake in the distance.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
He sees an oasis.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
He wants to go there.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
He wants to drink water.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
He finally found this water,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
the desolate desert.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
He approaches the lake and suddenly sees

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
that the Gorynych snake is located somewhere near the trees.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Naturally, Ivan Tsarevich grabs the saber

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
and begins to fight with the Gorynych snake.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
He cuts off one head,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
another grows in its place.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And so Ivan Tsarevich and the Gorynych snake fought for a long time.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Then they both got tired.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
They sat down.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
And then the Gorynych snake says,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Ivan, what did you want?

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Ivan says, to drink water.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Then the Gorynych snake says,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
well, you should have drunk.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Why did you come to me?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Thus, I want to confirm once again

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
that the goal should be very clear.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
After all, if the goal of our Ivan Tsarevich

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
was to drink water,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
then first of all he would have done exactly this.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
No other goal would have knocked him down.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
He would not think about anything else now.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
For our leaders,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
especially in the conditions of change in the company,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
it is very important to have a clear goal,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
a clear plan of achievement,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
and not to be distracted by goals that are less important now

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
or goals that are less significant now.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
So, a very important point is

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
setting a goal,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
but we will come back to this later.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
And we move on to the topic of coaching organizational changes.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Many managers

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
have adopted such a sentence by Tom Peters

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
that you need to change or die.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Why is this so important now?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
The pace of the company's growth,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
the pace of interaction,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
the pace of competition is increasing,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
increasing, increasing.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And now it is very important for companies

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
not only to develop,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
but to have time to compete.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
To compete with their competitors,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
to compete for clients.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
It is perfectly clear that there are more and more goods,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
and it is not a secret that they are becoming more and more similar to each other.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
And companies need to stand out in some way.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
To show that they are the leaders.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
That they have the best product.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
That they are worthy of being noticed by clients.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Of course, the pace of growth is very high.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
The pace of competition is high,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
but so are the rates.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And if we talk about the fact that a long-term manager

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
should anticipate,

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
a long-term manager should think about what will happen tomorrow.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Not even today, not yesterday.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
But about how to make it tomorrow.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
What should I do

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
to not only flourish now,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
but also tomorrow,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and in the future, and in a year, and in 10 years.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And this is quite important for us now.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Look at how fast the transmission of messages has increased.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Because if earlier,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
literally 50 years ago,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
people could not even think that they would communicate on mobile phones.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
To communicate, people had to either overcome great distances,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
or use a telegraph, or intercity communication,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
or a phone, which was probably not yet everywhere.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
What is happening now?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Sometimes the manager sits in his office,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
takes a mobile phone and calls his subordinate.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
He may not even call him, but just call him.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Indeed, the pace, even the transmission of messages,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
and communication between people has accelerated.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
If we talk about communication,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
it is becoming more and more electronic.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
A large number of messages are sent by e-mail,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
by SMS.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
There is less personal communication.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And all this tells us that the pace is increasing.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
That the information that is important now

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
should be transmitted by e-mail.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
That changes should happen in a lightning speed.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Only then will we be able to participate in this race.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes, life is such that we must be here in time.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And it is the coaching methods that can help

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
to develop successfully.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
And to develop not only now, but also in the future.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
And it is perfectly clear that changes

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
are not only about the speed of communication,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
but also about the speed of communication.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
And it is perfectly clear that changes in a company

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
can have a completely different nature.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
It can be minor changes,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
which concern one department, for example.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
It can be changes in the entire company structure.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
It can be changes in the management system.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Changes in the managers and top staff.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Whatever they are,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
nevertheless, their implementation

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
is associated with certain difficulties.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Their implementation must be done quickly and effectively.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
No one will want to make changes now

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
just for the sake of changes.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
These changes are ripe,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
these changes are necessary.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
And they can affect both a single person

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
in the company,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
and the entire company, the entire structure in general.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
And we will talk about this too.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
The question is often raised by managers.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
How to manage all this?

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Will the methods I used before

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
work in the current situation?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
What can I do to manage

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
even more effectively?

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
And these are really coaching questions.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
These are questions about how to act

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
and how to do it quickly.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
In particular, this question is often asked.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
How can I restructure my activities

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
so that my company succeeds?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
What can I do as a manager

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
to make something change for the better

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
in my department?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
But these questions are most likely

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
coming from the managers.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
In rare cases, the manager himself

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
thinks about how to improve something

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
at the linear level.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Nevertheless, when the coach works

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
even with the linear staff,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
very interesting topics arise.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
One of the managers asked to conduct

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
a coaching session for the linear staff.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
He said,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
There are only four women working

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
and they are doing their job.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Talk to them.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I would like them to work better.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
When we talked to them,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
when we found out what they do,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
what they want to do

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
and what they could do better,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
it turned out that these are creative enough personalities.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
These are the people who are interested in this company.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
These are the people who know

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
how to improve the interaction in their department

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
and want to improve the interaction with other departments.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
When the manager received the report

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
about our work, he was surprised.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
He said,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Are these four women really capable

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
and ready to improve something?

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
We are coming back to the point

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
that we should believe

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
that our employees have a great potential.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
That these employees can work better.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
That these employees are ready for more.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
We should give them time.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
We should listen to them.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Maybe we should recommend something.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Maybe we should ask for coaching.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
What would you like to change in your work?

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
What do you need to work more effectively?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
What would you like to get from your work in the future?

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
These are quite simple questions,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
but they take people to a completely different level of thinking.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
These are questions that a person does not ask himself every day.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
As a rule, people ask themselves

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
what they want to do.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
What do you want to do?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
What do you want to do?

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
As a rule, people who work in an organization,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
if we are not talking about top management,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
they are in a daily race.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
They have a certain task,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
they have a certain rhythm,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
they are constantly in it.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
And very rarely one of them thinks,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
what can I improve here?

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
What can I do better, more effectively and faster?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
We were considering a scheme

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
that told us that the indicators

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
of the organization's efficiency

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
really improve when we provide coaching.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
It seems like a magical improvement,

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
but nevertheless,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
the simplicity of these questions is powerful.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
Try to answer this question.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
How can you improve your activity?

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
What can you do faster,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
better or more effectively?

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Do you have any suggestions

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
that you would like to introduce

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
to the work of your group,

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
your organization,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
in order to improve the activity

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
of the whole organization?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
What do you need

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
to be more successful in this organization?

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
I assure you,

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
you will get very interesting answers.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
At least, think about it.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
It is really important.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
So, the topic we are going to discuss

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
is organizational changes.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
And if we define

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
what organizational changes are,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
it is a process of transition

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
of the system to a new quality state.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
To a new quality state.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
And this state is connected

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
with the ideas of where to develop,

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
what to move to,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
and what is the goal of these changes.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
So, organizational changes

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
are going to a new level.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
And to a new level with the original request.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
If we talk about the development

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
of the sales department,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
the changes in the sales department

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
can influence the productivity

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
and profitability.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
The quality is expressed in the fact

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
that people will work more,

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
and the company will get more profit.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Of course, we need to work on it.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
It is unlikely that we want

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
this department to work better

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
and it will work better.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
No, we need to work on it.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
And we need to do it

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
so that our employees feel more strength,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
more confidence that they can do it.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
And we, as managers, can do it.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
We can inspire these employees

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
to work with more dedication,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
with more interest,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
and not only material.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
And if we talk about the goals of these changes,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
then it is, first of all,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
achieving success.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
It is improving the organization

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
and it is a good indicator.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
But still, if we talk about the changes,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
they are very connected with the problems.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Because if we introduce something new

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
in the organization,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
we usually face resistance

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
from the employees.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Whatever these employees are,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
but as a rule, any change,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
any innovation can face an obstacle,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
resistance from the employees.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And these problems need to be solved again.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
So, if we think about

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
what is the process of organizational changes,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Please, look at the slide.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Here we see that any changes

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
that we plan to introduce

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
occur together with the solution.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Yes, there are changes,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
then the solution of these changes,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
but nevertheless, we usually face problems.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
And to solve these problems,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
we plan some changes again.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
And so on, to infinity.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
That is, by introducing these changes,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
we not only achieve success,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
but also a side effect.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
There are difficulties that we face

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
and that need to be solved.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Thus, we can say that the process

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
of organizational changes

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
is not paradoxically unchanged.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
That only by constantly changing something

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
in the company,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
constantly maintaining this rhythm

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Companies that operate in the old way

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
are usually not successful.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Our task is to ensure

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
continuity of this process.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
To do everything necessary

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
to make changes happen.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
And to make these changes,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
which will even be accompanied by difficulties,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
to be overcome.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
A simple example.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
In one of the companies,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
CRM system was introduced.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Of course, this is a change in the company.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
This is a new introduction.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
What do you think the employees' reaction was?

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
More than half refused to work with this system.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
They even, one might say,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
sabotaged this system.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
So, we had to think again.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
What to do to make our employees

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
want to use this system?

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
To make them use it successfully?

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
Here is a new task.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
What can we do to make them

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
start using it?

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
And to make it fast,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
effective and easy?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
It took some time,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
and all employees switched to CRM system.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
But the HR department had to try.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
They had to come up with motivation factors,

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
and the CEO had to try

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
to implement these changes.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
It also cost some money.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
This is a small illustration

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
that changes should be continuous.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
We are introducing something new in our company.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Even if we are successful now,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
we have to think about the future.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
We have to think about tomorrow.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
What else should we do tomorrow

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
to make our company successful?

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
What can I do personally?

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
How can I influence my employees?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
What questions can I ask them?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
How can I motivate them

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
to move in a single mode?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
So that each employee knows their job

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
and does it well.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
How to promote employees?

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
How to punish them?

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
This is the CEO's task.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
I'd like to move on to the topic

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
of changing the coaching formula.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
We've talked about changes in the company.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
If we take the coaching position,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
we can consider such factors.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
There is a usual action,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
an old-fashioned action,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
the way we always work.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
People are creatures

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
that get used to this status quo.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
They did it yesterday,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
they do it today,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
and they want to do it tomorrow.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
This is quite strong.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
This is what makes them resist the change.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
But what can we do in coaching

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
to make this aspiration

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
to change and improvement exist?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
One of such elements is

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
dissatisfaction with the current situation.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
This is one of the key elements.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
If you are satisfied with everything,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
if your company is doing great

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
and you don't want to change anything,

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
changes will happen

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
as they say, with a creak.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
These changes will be less effective

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
than we'd like,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
and maybe not necessary.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
The basic thing we should say

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
is dissatisfaction with the current situation.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Next,

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
it's understanding how important

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
this change is and what it will lead to.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
If we understand that

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
the same service system

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
will make it easier

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
to track the base,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
to communicate with clients,

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
to simplify the turnover system,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
these are all advantages.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Tell your employees about these advantages.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Explain to them why it's so important.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
This is the second element.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Understanding the goal,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
what we are making these changes for.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
The third element is a clear action plan.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
These are planned steps

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
to achieve the goal.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
What should we do?

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
What steps should we take

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
to reach the goal?

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Of course,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
the sum of these three elements,

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
dissatisfaction with the current situation,

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
a clear goal and a plan,

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
these three elements should be more important.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
They should be stronger

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
than the desire to be a status quo

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
and to act in the old way.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
This is a good tool for the manager

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
to implement these tools of change,

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
to act more actively

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
and to understand what we are doing.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
As we said,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
only what is realized,

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
only what a person really wants to do,

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
he will do.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
If this is not the case,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
we can only stimulate this person to achieve.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
But we cannot force him.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
You know, there is an expression,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
you can bring a horse to the pond,

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
but it is impossible to force it to drink.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
So,

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
we should be guided by this formula of change.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I will repeat it again.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Dissatisfaction with the current situation,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
a clear goal and a plan.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
These are the things we need to implement changes.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Now we will talk about the coaching steps

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
in organizational changes.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
The first thing to say

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
is that we should be prepared for the diagnosis.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
Before implementing something new in the organization,

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
including coaching,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
we should understand

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
how ready the organization is for it,

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
what organizational changes are planned to be implemented,

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
and how ready the employees are for coach management.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
The second point of this program

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
is coaching for determining goals.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
We have already discussed this point,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
but now we will discuss it in more detail.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
The third point is planning.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Coaching at the planning stage.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
And the fourth stage is feedback.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Feedback to both the supervisor

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
and the supervisor

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
in the sense that

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
the supervisor is not the only one

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
who is responsible for the changes.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
The coach is also responsible for the changes.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
The supervisor is responsible for the changes.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
These are the four basic blocks

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
that we will regulate in the system

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
that needs to be changed.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
The company itself

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
should determine

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
what changes are needed,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
what changes are needed now,

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
and accordingly invite the coach,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
who will be able to determine

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
the important points

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
that concern coaching.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
I would like to draw your attention

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
to the next slide,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
where we will see how to apply coaching

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
at the analysis stage.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
At this stage, the coach asks a number of questions.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
These may be questions like

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
What is the sphere of the organization's activity

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
or the team's division

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
or the committee's needs

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
in the changes above all?

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Why are the changes in this area so important?

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
How will the changes in the selected sphere

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
affect the other areas of the company's activity?

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
Why are these changes needed now?

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Are the selected structures ready for the changes?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
What consequences can there be

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
due to the implementation of these changes?

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
It is natural that there are a lot of questions

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
that should be asked at the diagnostic stage.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
But first of all,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
the supervisor, who wishes to implement

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
the changes,

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
should answer these questions.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
If we consider an example

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
from a trading company,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
where the supervisor invited a coach

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
to implement the changes in his company,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
what can be done better?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
He already had experience

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
in implementing changes,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
both successful and not so successful,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
and at this stage he decided

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
to use the help and support of the coach.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
What did we do at this stage?

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
We asked him questions.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Which sphere of the company's activity

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
should be changed first?

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Perhaps, by changing something

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
in this system of the organization,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
you can influence the change.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
He mentioned several categories

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
that need to be changed in his company.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
In particular,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
it was the qualification of the staff

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
who worked in the sales department.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
His qualification of these employees

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
did not quite suit him.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
And, accordingly,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
it was one of the main tasks

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
that he wanted to solve.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
But he had no idea

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
how to do it.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Of course, there were tasks

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
that were in line with this.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
It was the increase of motivation

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
of the employees and the achievement

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
of new goals.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
But first of all,

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
what could he do

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
to make the processes

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
in this department more effective?

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
What could he do

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
to make the processes

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
in this department more effective?

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
So that the employees

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
could better cope with their duties.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Here, of course,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
we came to the conclusion

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
that instead of the new employees

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
who would naturally be associated

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
with new costs,

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
we should work with those

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
who are already there.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
We should work with those people

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
who are already in the department.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
We should stimulate them to work.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Some of these employees

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
needed to be trained.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
For some of them,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
we should have given instructions

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
as for new employees.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
For some of them,

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
we should have stimulated them

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
by changing their motivation.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
As a result, the head came to the conclusion

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
that the motivation for these employees

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
should be varied.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
And together we have chosen

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
such a system of motivation

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
that was really adequate

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
at this stage of development.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Which could really stimulate

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
these employees to work better.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
From the conversation of the employees

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
I can say that the new employees

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
are not satisfied with the new instructions.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
The instructions that were sent down

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
were not always acceptable.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
But as you understand,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
quite often the managers

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
do not ask how much you like it.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
They send instructions

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
and then face difficulties.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
And the coaching approach

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
helps to find the compromise

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
when the manager is satisfied

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
with the way the employees work

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
and with their motivation.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
And the employees are satisfied

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
with the system that was built.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
In particular,

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
we conducted team coaching

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
where these employees

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
conducted some kind of brainstorming

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
in the presence of their manager.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
The employees themselves determined

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
what their motivation would be.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
What would they like to have?

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
How would they like to work?

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
And what motivation would they like to have?

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
It's a multi-stage process.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
And it was quite successful.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
The manager and the employees

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
were satisfied.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
It's one of those moments

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
when everyone wins.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
The manager and the employees.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
But the organization also wins.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
The organization gets more profit.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
It gets loyal employees.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
It gets employees

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
who are ready to work here.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Employees who won't leave the company.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
They created their own motivation.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
It all came from them.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
These are the employees

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
who will stay in the organization.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Because besides the material factors

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
there are also non-material factors.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
The employees felt more free here.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
They felt respected.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
They were considered.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
And it's good enough.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
Because directives don't always work.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
Directives nowadays

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
can't be as effective

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
as they were a few years ago.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
That's why coaching can help.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
It's really easy.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
You ask questions, get answers

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
and change your actions.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
But that's what you should strive for.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
It's the non-directive approach

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
that makes the shift from the directive

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
to the place of instructions.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Questions.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
Questions that can stimulate

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
both the leaders, employees and the organization.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Next.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
I'd like to move on to the topic of goals.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
The goal in the organization.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
The goal set by the leader.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
The goal that the whole team will strive for.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
So, if we talk about

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
the goal set by the leader

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
the first question to ask is

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
what do you want to achieve?

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
What result do you want to achieve?

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
These are questions that

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
are constantly in the leader's head.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
How do I achieve a certain goal?

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
How do I achieve a certain goal?

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
How do I reach a new level of profitability?

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
How do I expand my influence?

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
How do I take a bigger share in the market?

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
All of this is really important.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
But what happens next?

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Usually, everyone acts

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
based on their past experience.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
Last year I did this and that.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
I'll do it now.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
But the actions I did last year

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
will lead to the same success.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Maybe they will, maybe they won't.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
So, you need to define your goal clearly.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Remember how it was with Ivan Tsarevich

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
and Zmei Gorynych.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
The clear goal should be so clear

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
so clear that there is no thought

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
that you can strive for something else.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
We achieve what we pay more attention to.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
So, in coaching there is a concept

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
called the final result format.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
Of course, you are familiar with the basic blocks

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
of this format.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
I'll give you a brief description.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
The first thing you need in the final result format

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
as a method of building goals

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
is to formulate this goal positively.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
What is positive?

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
If we talk about the goal of improvement

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
of a department or a company

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
then this goal is

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
a new market

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
or a goal of achieving new effects

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
or a new product market.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
But this is not a goal

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
that we say

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
we don't want to lag behind anymore

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
we don't want to be lazy anymore

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
we don't want to be late anymore.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
This is not a goal.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
This is more like a complaint

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
that we won't work with.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
The goal here is

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
what we want.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
And the goal is stated in the terms of the future.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
This is a goal that is

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
a little bit ahead.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
This is a goal that we will reach.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
So, in short

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
the goal is to bring the company to a new level.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
The goal is to increase the income.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
The goal is to bring a new product.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
These are goals that are formulated positively.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
The second point

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
that is a component of the final result

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
is that it is important

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
that this goal is within your control.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So that the goal you set

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
you can achieve it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So that its achievement depends on you

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
as a leader.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Because if we set a goal

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
that for some reason

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
we can't control now

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
then its probability of achieving it is really small.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
A leader, when setting a certain goal

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
must mean

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
what he can control.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And in no case choose goals

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
that are not under his control.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
If we talk about middle managers

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
not everyone can be controlled by the resources of the organization.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Not everyone can sign certain documents.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Not every leader can be

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
financed.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So if we set a certain goal

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
then we need to think about

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
whether it is within my control

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
or within the control of my employees.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And they have access to all the necessary resources.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And it is very important here

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
even if this goal is not under your control

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
think about how you can

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
transfer what is not under your control

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
to the control zone.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Let's say

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
if at this moment

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
you don't have access to certain documents

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
that are necessary for changes

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
what can you do to get access to them?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
What specific steps should be taken

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
to get these documents

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
or this information?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
So the second very important point

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
is the goal within my control

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
at least 50%.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
If this is not the case

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
then we won't be able to work

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
within the control zone.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Next, probably everyone knows

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
the formula SMART.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
We won't dwell on it in detail

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
we will just comment on it.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
SMART is the ability to set smart goals

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
that are specific enough

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
that are measurable

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that are achievable

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and that are determined in time.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is the SMART that you most likely use.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And it is great that it is so.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I would like to move on

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
to the next stage of the final result format.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It is environmentalism.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
What is environmentalism?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
We are all used to think that ecology is nature

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
ecology is the environment

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
but what do we mean by this

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
when we use the term environmentalism?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Environmentalism means

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
that the result of achieving this goal

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
will be positive for us.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That despite the fact

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
that there may be some side effects

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
some problems with changes

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
we will still achieve

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
some positive changes

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
that will help us

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
to neutralize these small problems.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Ecology is a very important factor.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Many companies strive for changes

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and implement these changes

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and only then start thinking

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
about how it all affected them.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
There is one example of a company

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
that had several branches

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
scattered around the Moscow region.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The head office was in Moscow

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and several branches in the Moscow region.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The head office decided

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that the most important thing for us

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
is to implement the assessment system

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
for all employees.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And this has started to be actively implemented.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The head office saw a positive effect

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and decided that it was necessary

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
to implement the same changes

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
in all branches in the Moscow region

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
to implement this assessment system.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But the only thing that no one thought about

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
was whether the implementation

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
of the assessment system in the branches

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
would bring the same positive effect.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Did they take into account

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
that completely different people work there?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
That the level of development of these branches

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
may not correspond to the level

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
of development of the Moscow office?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Nevertheless, these changes were made.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
This assessment system began to be implemented

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and implemented and implemented.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Colossal funds were spent.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
What is the result?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Two of these branches in the Moscow region

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
were closed

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
because people working there

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
were not ready for this.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Let's think about

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
how environmentally friendly

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
this change was for the company.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Did this company acquire something

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
that could be harmful to the organization?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Before implementing changes,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
before setting this goal for yourself,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it is necessary to think very clearly

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
about environmental friendliness.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Will something happen that I don't want?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Will something happen

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
that could interfere with the organization?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Providing these factors,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
we really win.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
There are many other ways

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
to make the same change.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It is worth thinking about these,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
about this law of environmental friendliness.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
These are the components

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
of the final result format.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I will repeat them again briefly.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
The final result format

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
is based on the following principles.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
The goal must be formulated positively.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
The goal must be in the zone of personal control.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The goal must meet the criteria of SMART.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The goal must be environmentally friendly.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
These are the basic principles

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
with which we work when setting a goal.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I would like to tell you

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
about the process of setting a goal.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I would like to tell you about the study

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
conducted by Edwin Locke in 1996.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
This scientist published a study

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
that he conducted for 30 years.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
A large number of people took part in it,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
from children to famous scientists.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
In this study, he pursued the goal

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
of understanding the environment

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and the environment.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
He wanted to understand

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
how people set goals for themselves

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and why they are so important.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I would like to share some results

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
of this study with you.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
In particular, he said that the more difficult

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
the goal a person sets for himself,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the more significant his sense of achievement is.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
A person gets more confidence

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
when he achieves this goal.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
The more specific the goal is,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
the easier it is to achieve.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
This is also important.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You should set your goals specifically.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The goal should be both specific and difficult.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Then it calls,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
it stimulates,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and the achievement of this goal

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
is a real satisfaction.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yes, I was able to do it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yes, it was a challenge for me,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
but I achieved it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It greatly affects self-esteem.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
The goal should be important for a person.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It should be not only difficult,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
but also important.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It should be achievable.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
We will achieve it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Another important point is

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
to get feedback.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
How much have I already achieved this goal?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
How good did I do it?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It is good when feedback,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
when assessment comes from a person

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
who is really dear to you,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
whose opinion you value,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
who is important to you.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Of course, the achievement of any goal,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
as you probably imagine,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
is connected with the fact

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
that you feel satisfied,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
confident and ready to move on.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Now I would like to move on

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
to the next topic,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
namely, coaching at the planning stage.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Please pay attention to the next slide.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
This is the William Bless system.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You are probably familiar with it.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
It covers two important categories

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
as important and urgent.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
We need to define

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and arrange our priorities.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Look, here we have such factors

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
on one axis.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
On the other axis there are factors

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
as important and unimportant.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
On the other axis there are urgent and non-urgent.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
There are things that are

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
important and urgent.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
They need to be done urgently.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
These are the burning questions

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
that need to be solved right now.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Along with this, there are other things

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
that are important enough

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
but not so urgent.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
These are the prevention questions.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There are also things

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
that can be called urgent

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
but not so important.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Here we see such events

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
as meetings,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
yes, they are really urgent

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and they need to be done right now

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
but maybe they are not so important.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
These are correspondence, calls.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And finally, if we look at the next slide,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
these are not urgent and not important things.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
These are the things

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
that your time will probably eat up.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
These are the things

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
that you might not have done.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
These are the so-called breaks.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
In accordance with this,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
the resources of the organization

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
can be placed in priority.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The resources will be allocated

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
to the important tasks.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Consider this scheme more carefully.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It is worth using.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Here you need to choose

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and plan for yourself

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
what tasks you can decide

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
as important and urgent,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
what tasks you can decide

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
as important and not so urgent.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Ask yourself these questions.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Plan your time.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
It is a really powerful tool for planning.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It is a tool that leads

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
to the distribution of priorities.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And when your priorities are set,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
the goal is much more achievable.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You know exactly what and why

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and in what order you need to do it.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And now I would like to give you a task.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And now I would like to give you a task.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Imagine that the project

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that you have just thought up,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
that you are working on,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
what result do you want to achieve

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
in one month,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
in six months,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
in six months,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
in a year,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
in five years,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
in ten years.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Have you thought about

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
what changes you need to make

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
in ten years to be successful

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
in ten years to be successful

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
in ten years to be successful

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
during all this time?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And if you consider your project,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
try to plan it not for one day,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
not for a week, but for a month.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
What will be the result of your work in a month?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
What will be the result of your work in a month?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
What will be the result of your work in a month?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
What will be the result of your work in a month?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Write it down.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Think about it.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Think about the stages you need to go through

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
in order to achieve your goals

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
in accordance with your planning.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And if we talk about

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
any plan,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
any task that is planned,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
it should have certain characteristics.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And this plan

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
should be short enough.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
You don't need to write plans for many, many, many sheets.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Shortness is the sister of talent.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
So, the plan is short, clear,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and it lists the steps that need to be taken

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
on the way to the goal.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Also, here is a very important point.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
If we make a plan for the whole organization,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
how much do we consider the opinions of the employees?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Their resources, their occupancy,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
their abilities, their capabilities.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Think about it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And then,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
does this plan correspond to the style,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
to the layout of your organization?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Are you all ready

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
to take it as a guide to action

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and to implement it for the whole team?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
After all, the actions of the whole team

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
will bring a really effective result.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
The actions of one person will not always be so effective.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Naturally, in this plan

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
we should specify all the necessary resources.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
If we need something additional,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
the plan should contain it.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
If we plan the development of our organization,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
increase in volume,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
income,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
then, accordingly, we should think about

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
what we need,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
what resources and what funds

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
we need to attract now

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
to increase the profit.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Perhaps, what specialists should be attracted,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
what information base should be obtained

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
to make all these changes

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
in accordance with the plan.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And a very important point is

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
to allocate the responsible people

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
to each of the blocks of our plan.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's not a secret that one department

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
is responsible for a certain function,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
another department is responsible for completely different functions.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Marketing department, sales department, personnel department

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
all have different functions.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
If you plan changes in the company,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
if they affect all these departments,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
then plan the responsible people

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and make sure that they are in control of these people

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
who are the driving force of these changes.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
So, the characteristics of the plan

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
are really very important

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and should be used actively.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The tool seems to be quite simple,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but nevertheless,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
as often happens,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
something simple works well.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Try to implement it.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Try to plan it

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
and make sure that this method works.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And now we move on to the next topic,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
namely, feedback in coaching.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
What is feedback?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
How do we provide feedback to our employees?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
After all, if you think about it,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
feedback is not a criticism.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Feedback is a developing tool.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Of course, you can say,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Ivanov, you did it wrong,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Petrov, you did it wrong.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But will their actions change after that?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Will Ivanov do everything right,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and Petrov do everything perfectly?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
What needs to be done

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
to make feedback a result of improvement?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Understanding feedback

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
is a two-way process,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
in which both those who give it

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and those who receive it are involved.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And the rules of feedback

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
are rules that should be observed.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So, in your feedback,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
for example, for an employee,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
use the following model.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
First, analyze the employee's actions.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
What did he do?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And how well did he do this job?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
This is an analysis of his activity.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Next, what is the effect

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
of the work that the employee did?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And the next point is,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
what can be improved here?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
What can be done better next time?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
What can be done better next time

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
to avoid possible mistakes

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
and to do something more effective

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and more effective?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Think about it.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
If you give feedback to your employee

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
and say,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
what did you do

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
in your actions at the exhibition?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You were standing at the stand,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
you were talking to the visitors,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
you were giving out booklets.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Great! What is the effect of your activity?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Most likely, the answer is the following.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I gave out so many booklets,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I talked to so many people.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And what else?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
What is the result?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
What can you do better next time?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
How can you show yourself in a different way

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
to achieve more effect?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
How else can you show yourself?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
If you just stand at the stand

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
and give out booklets,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
what else can you do?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Talk to people who visit this exhibition,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
maybe.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It is known that some people even sign contracts

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
at the exhibition.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
There is no limit to perfection.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You should always think about your feedback,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
what can be improved.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
These are three basic blocks

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
of developing feedback.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
As a rule, the effect of feedback

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
is the employee's inspiration,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
what can he do differently from the critics?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
If the employee is criticized,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
if he is told that he did everything wrong,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
does he have a desire to do something else?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Most likely, no.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
If you go the other way,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
if you give the employee a developing feedback,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
you will notice how inspired he is.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
It is really so.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
The employee will be grateful to you

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
for your hard work,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
for your opinion,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
for your interest in what he can do better.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Of course, all this should happen

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
in a system of normal relationships,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
relationships of trust and openness.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
The employees also have a feeling

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
that they are appreciated,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
that they are needed.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
If the management is interested in my work,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
if the management is so attentive to my work,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
they appreciate me, they value me.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
This is also an important factor

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
of the loyalty of our staff.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And the last question we ask the employee is

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
what can you do better?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Maybe I can help you with something.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
These questions really stimulate

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
this employee to do something better,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
to find some ways

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
how I can act better,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
how I can show myself better.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Accordingly, the employee who has improved something

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
feels joy,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
feels pride for himself,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
for his work.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And the employee who has improved something

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
feels pride for himself.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Will this employee want to work with you further?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
He will.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Any person wants recognition

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
and any person wants positive feedback.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Accordingly, feedback is a really powerful tool.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It is really worth using.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Coaching of the subordinate

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Coaching of the subordinate

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Now our topic is

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
coaching of the subordinate.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
What can we say here?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
When do we need coaching of the subordinate?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
We have already talked about

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
what type of employee needs coaching.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Most likely, it is not worth involving

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
the employee who has just joined our company.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The employee who needs to adapt

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and get some knowledge

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and skills of working in this system.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and get some knowledge and skills of working in this system.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Most likely, coaching is necessary for employees

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
who are already in the business,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
who are ready to work.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And here we need to understand

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
which employee needs this support

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
and which does not.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Maybe there are employees who are doing great without coaching

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
who are already working well

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and there is no need to change anything.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and there is no need to change anything.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Look at your subordinates.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Maybe some of them need this feedback

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
and need coaching.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Look at your subordinates who are ready to grow

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
and who need this help and support

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and look at their abilities

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and you will be of help

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
not only to this person,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
but to the whole company.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
When one employee's potential grows

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
it can have an impact on the whole company's potential

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
because his actions lead to the success of the whole company.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Of course, if you see that the employee

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
is on the contrary, maybe a bit lazy

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
or somehow started to work worse than before

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
you should also pay attention to him

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and ask him some coaching questions.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
What's going on?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Maybe you are missing something?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Maybe you need to do something now?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Or what can I do for you?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Such employees who are a bit lazy

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
also need our attention

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
because they have such a great potential

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
as well as the employees who are ahead of their time.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And our task is to develop this potential in them.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And it's worth coaching these employees too.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
What do we need to do?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
What do we need to do?

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
What do we need to do?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
What can you use to determine

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
which employee needs coaching?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The first and quite obvious measurement

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is the assessment results

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and assessment results,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
maybe annual.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
If you look at these results

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
you will probably understand

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
who should be touched

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and who should really do coaching.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
One of the factors is regular meetings.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
You meet with your employees,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
you communicate with people

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and you can understand perfectly well

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
that one of them is active,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
successful

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
and the other one is not very active.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
If a person is not very active

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
it's worth paying attention to him.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Of course, one of the important functions

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
of a coach as a leader

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
is observance.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Observe your employees.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Observe what's going on with them.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Maybe something has changed.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
If you notice and correct all these changes

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
the success of the whole company

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
and your personal success

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
will be much more natural.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Pay attention to this.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Let's look at the probability

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
of a positive result from coaching

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
for some of our subordinates.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Pay attention to how often

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
the behavior that requires correction

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
is changing.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
As you have already noticed,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
maybe some of your subordinates

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
became less effective.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Maybe some of the people

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
paid less attention to the important tasks

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
of the company.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Or maybe a salesman from the sales department

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
who used to be a winner

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
and now has bad results.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
What he sells now

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
may not be what he is capable of.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
The second axis is how deep

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
the cause of this behavior lies.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Pay attention to this.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
If this behavior is rare

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
and it's just a reaction

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
to a particular situation

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
it's easy to change it

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
even with the help of coaching methods.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
But if this behavior

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
is often shown

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
and you notice that it's a manifestation

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
of this person's character

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
it will be difficult to change it

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
even if it's not possible at all.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Such characteristics should be

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
considered by HR services

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
when they hire a person.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
They should consider the characteristics

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and behavioral functions

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
that this person has,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
values and beliefs.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
In accordance with this

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
coaching should be done.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
For a beginner coaching manager

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
it's easier to work with people

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
who were in the first square.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The behavior that is needed

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
in the correction is not shown often

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
and it's not characteristic of this person.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It's a kind of a surge.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Then it's easy to adjust it

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
even for beginners.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Let's move on to the next topic.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Our topic is called

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Coaching of a Manager.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
The coaching of a manager

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
differs from the coaching of a subordinate.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Here a professional coach

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and a manager are in a partnership.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Here a coach will ask

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
such questions to a manager.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What is the purpose of the change?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Why is it valuable and important for the company?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
What results do you want to achieve?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
What role does the coach play here?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
It's perfectly clear that

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
if the goal is to increase the profit,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
then within half an hour

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
during which the coach works with the manager

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
this goal will not be achieved.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
The result of this change

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
will be a plan,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
a clear goal,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
clear steps to this goal,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
motivation,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and the power to act.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
But not the increase of the profit.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Here is a distribution of responsibility.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
The coach is responsible for

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
building up the coaching process,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
to ask the necessary questions

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and get answers from the manager.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But the management takes the implementation

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
of this plan and strategy on itself.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And here is only the support

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
feedback from the coach

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
at a certain point.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
What did you achieve now?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
How do I evaluate it?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Is it good enough?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Yes, I can move on.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Or what I achieved now is not good enough?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Then maybe I should go back a little

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and see what went wrong.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
What happened here that

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
did not allow this result to manifest?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And the tasks that the managers

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
want to solve for themselves with coaching

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
could be the following.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It can be communication improvement

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
with the managers and employees.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
It can even be presentation skills,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
communication skills with people.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
It is really an important point for the manager.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
It can also be a request to improve

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
their management skills,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
planning, organization and control.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It is also an important point for the manager.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
After all, the manager,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
while being continuously in the process

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
of managing the organization,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
performs many functions.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
And each of them he must perform efficiently.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Naturally, we support the manager in this.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
We stimulate and guide them.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Naturally, the potential of a person,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
the potential of a leader is needed in this recovery.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Some managers ask me

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
about the consideration of a mission

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and vision for their company.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
In one case,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
a manager of a well-known company

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
invited us to his office

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
and said,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
«Our mission is already formed.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Do you have it already?»

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
«Yes, it is already formed.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It is in the upper drawer of my table.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
What is it like?»

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
«I don't remember. I'll get it and see».

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Is it a mission if a person doesn't remember it

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and doesn't know how it is formulated?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It is unlikely.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
What is really important,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
what stimulates and moves,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
just like vision,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
is that a manager must have a vision

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
of what he is going to,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
what he leads the whole organization to.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
If a person has this vision,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
if he already knows what result he wants to achieve,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
then he can inspire and guide his subordinates.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
If he doesn't know what he is moving to,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
who can he inspire?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Can he do it at all?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
He doesn't seem to be very inspired.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Maybe he is just here

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
until he finds another place.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
This is also a very important point.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
It is the point that determines a manager.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
A vision is a manager.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Of course, employees must also take part

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
in its formation.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
But a priori, it is a manager's function.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Coaching can be very useful here.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
We talked about coaching for a manager

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
who conducts professional coaching.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But if we think about the fact

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that there is no coaching in the company

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
at the moment,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
there are several managers

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
who already have some basic knowledge

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
and coaching skills.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Can they conduct coaching for each other?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
They can.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
But there are also some points

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
that should be taken into account.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Coaching will be effective for two managers

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
only when they work

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
within the same organization.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
When their status in the company

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
is approximately equal.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It should not be a general manager

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
and a warehouse manager.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It should be a commercial manager

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
or a executive manager.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
These are people who are on the same hierarchy.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Again, if one of the managers

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
decides that he needs a coach,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
he needs a person

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
with whom he can discuss everything,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
someone he can trust,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and the same person

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
who has information about this organization.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Here, too, it is necessary to be guided

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
by the fact that the coach, the manager

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
and the manager who needs coaching

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
are different people.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
If one of them is fast, active

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
and the other is slow and calm,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
it is unlikely that they will be comfortable

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
conducting a coaching session.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
If you need coaching as a manager,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
try to find a manager

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
of your organization

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
who is about the same as you

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Think about who you could trust,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
who you could be sincere with,

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
who you could discuss the issues

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
that are really important to you,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
who from the managers of your company

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
you would like to get feedback from,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
how to evaluate your activities

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
in order to correct your actions

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
and be more effective later.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And, of course, if such interaction

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
will take place,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
it is rather a sign of your success,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
a sign of your development,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
when you, as a person, are ready

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
to trust,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
to work on yourself

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
and to share the information

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
that concerns you

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
and to be ready to receive feedback.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Even developing feedback

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
may not always be pleasant,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
but it is important and necessary

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
to correct your actions

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
and to be more effective later.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
So, today we have discussed

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
some blocks of coaching

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
in the management of changes.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I would like to briefly summarize

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
that coaching is really

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
a very strong and powerful tool

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
in managing changes in the company.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Those organizations that have already

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
introduced this method

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
for their team members

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
really get great results.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
People like to work in the company

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
that interests them.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
People work with more dedication

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
in the company where they are listened to,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
where they are perceived

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
and where they get positive feedback.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
As you have already understood,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
coaching can be done

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
at the level of a subordinate manager

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
or a subordinate subordinate

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
or a manager manager.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
You just need to act

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
based on the coaching principles

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
that we have discussed.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
So, today we have discussed

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
the coaching of organizational changes.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I sincerely wish you

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
to use these methods

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and to get great results.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
After all, every company

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
that introduces this method

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
really achieves success.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
You can already use this knowledge,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
develop these skills in yourself

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
and apply them to your organization.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Thank you for your attention!
