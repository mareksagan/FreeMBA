00:05.000 --> 00:15.000
The next limited resource is the ability to do psychoanalysis, knowledge of psychology.

00:16.000 --> 00:28.000
The ability to carefully carry out a pre-project analysis of the members of our team or the future team,

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
and the members of our team, with whom we will have to work in the project.

00:35.000 --> 00:44.000
The ability to put on the skin of another person, to live in his image.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
The ability to empathize.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
This ability is called empathy in psychology.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Empathy is the ability to empathize.

00:59.000 --> 01:12.000
A professional manager must have these resources, he must understand psychology, and he must have elements of empathy.

01:12.000 --> 01:28.000
Before starting to work in a team with our employees, with other participants, we must live in the image of these employees, these participants.

01:29.000 --> 01:40.000
If we do not know who we are dealing with, in what language to speak, what concepts to use,

01:40.000 --> 01:53.000
then we can hardly call our communication skills, our process of interaction with the members of the team successful.

01:54.000 --> 02:07.000
All this leads to the development of our limited resource, knowledge of psychology, psychoanalysis, and the possession of elements of empathy.

02:07.000 --> 02:21.000
If we return to the basic definition of the project, we will see that this resource is very much in demand.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
Let's remember that a project is an event aimed at creating a new product or service.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
This means that there is an element of novelty in any project.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Now let's live in the image of limited resources.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
First, the client, the participant of the project, and then the performer or general contractor.

02:51.000 --> 03:05.000
If we carefully analyze this situation, then we become clear about the implementation of the turnover document, the production case, and so on.

03:06.000 --> 03:22.000
It is clear that when the project is implemented, the client should not and cannot create a professional, high-quality technical task for the final product.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
It seems to me that the situation is very interesting.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
If we consider the interaction of two participants in the project, the client and the performer,

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
the performer, the contractor, approaches the client and asks,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
«Tell me what you want. Give me a technical task».

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Not «I want this, I don't know that, I will go there, I don't know where».

03:50.000 --> 04:00.000
It seems to me that the requirements of the performer, the general contractor, are very reasonable.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
The technical task should be prepared by the client.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
However, if we carefully analyze the essence of the project, we will see that this approach is flawed.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Why? Because there is always an element of novelty in the project.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Even if it is small in some projects, it is there.

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
And when the client approaches this new element, it is new for him, he does not know it, he does not understand it.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
He describes this element incorrectly, wrongly.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
And these inaccuracies in the technical task will then emerge at the final phase of the project

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
and can emerge with very, very large negative consequences.

04:54.000 --> 05:03.000
It is clear that the client cannot and should not create this part of the technical task.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
He must delegate this responsibility to the professional.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
And he did not choose this organization, these specialists, as a general contractor or performer in vain.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
And they position themselves as professionals in this sphere, which is relatively new for the client.

05:28.000 --> 05:40.000
From this we come to the conclusion that the technical task as a product should be formed jointly with the client and the performer.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
Moreover, if we consider the formal side, then the consequences are very interesting.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
If the client fully develops the technical task and gives it to the performer,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
then the situation usually unfolds as follows.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
The performer, without much effort, does everything in accordance with the technical task.

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
He will do both the part that is described by the client and which is new for the client.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And there are probably some inaccuracies.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
They must be, by definition, a property of the project.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
The performer will do it as a result, and there will be mistakes.

06:28.000 --> 06:46.000
And the performer has a legal basis to close his shortcomings or appeal to the fact that he did everything in accordance with the technical task that the client gave him.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
As they say, the performer says the following proverb.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
You have seen what you have bought, eat at least as much as you can.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
This is it.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Where did it come from?

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
From the fact that the client did not fully understand what a project is, what project activity is.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
If he had allocated a little resource in this direction and thought about it, analyzed it,

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
he would have drawn up a draft of the technical task or a sketch and given it to the general contractor,

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
so that he would modify it and then return it to the approval or approval.

07:38.000 --> 07:51.000
Moreover, in complex projects, experienced customers fully delegate this responsibility for the technical task to the general contractor.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Moreover, a resource is allocated in terms of time and finances, and this work is paid for.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Why?

08:00.000 --> 08:12.000
Because a correct, professionally designed technical task contains a significant part of the solutions to the problems that are aimed at achieving the goal of the project.

08:13.000 --> 08:29.000
As many teachers say in our high school, a correctly formulated task or question contains more than half of the answer to this question.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
So, the technical task is, in fact, the formulation of the task, the formulation of the question.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
And the quality of the technical task also depends on the success of the project.

08:44.000 --> 08:55.000
Thus, we understand that by embodying the image of the customer, the image of the performer, the general contractor,

08:55.000 --> 09:12.000
we immediately get a correction of our specific actions aimed at successfully reaching the project results.

09:12.000 --> 09:26.000
This is done in order to minimize the conceptual risks of the project, which are often dominant in project activities.

09:27.000 --> 09:42.000
The next quality that a project manager should have is that he must understand the essence of leadership.

09:43.000 --> 09:55.000
If we look at the formation of a team of professionals, which can provide the maximum efficiency of the project,

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
we understand that we are talking about the maximum ROI, the return of investment to the project,

10:02.000 --> 10:18.000
then a project manager should strive to have a team of leaders in a particular area, which is involved in project management,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
and, above all, in the subject area.

10:22.000 --> 10:33.000
It often happens that in practice, managers look at the leaders with some kind of jealous attitude.

10:33.000 --> 10:48.000
It often happens that, due to their weakness, managers simply can't stand the fact that leaders appear in the team.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
And they identify leadership.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
In fact, leadership and leadership are two different entities.

11:00.000 --> 11:14.000
We can make a brief analogy, although it is not exactly one-to-one, but we can compare the following situation.

11:14.000 --> 11:25.000
A dog has a leader, and he leads the whole team.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
All dogs in the team unconditionally obey the leader.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
But the one who sits on the sledges controls all this.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
That is, the ratio between leadership and leadership is approximately clear.

11:46.000 --> 12:00.000
Although I emphasize that this is not exactly a one-to-one comparison, but the shades of the ratio between leadership and leadership are approximately clear.

12:00.000 --> 12:13.000
On the other hand, a project manager is a person who is responsible for the administrative implementation of the project,

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
for the most effective organization and coordination of the project.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
He has administrative and financial levers of management.

12:25.000 --> 12:34.000
As for the subject matter of the project implementation, as for the narrow areas of activity,

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
of course, he delegates this to his team members at the professional level.

12:45.000 --> 13:03.000
And, of course, if professionals are formed in the team, then they should focus on leadership in these areas of business, in these areas of the subject matter of the project.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
And on leadership in a good understanding of this word, on leadership on a large scale.

13:10.000 --> 13:19.000
That is, if we have a specialist in the project, a builder, an engineer-builder,

13:19.000 --> 13:38.000
then, of course, he must perceive himself as a professional and at the same time strive to be an objective professional of the front line in this area of business, in this area of activity.

13:39.000 --> 13:52.000
We should not somehow push or slow the aspirations of our team members to leadership.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
On the contrary, we should instill the aspiration for leadership.

13:58.000 --> 14:13.000
And if we have a team of project members, really from the leaders in certain areas, then the project will be implemented with maximum efficiency.

14:14.000 --> 14:28.000
It is clear that the project leader should be a leader in the area of interaction within the team, first of all.

14:28.000 --> 14:50.000
The project leader should create working conditions and activities for the team members in such a way that they reach the forefront of their professional field and become leaders.

14:51.000 --> 15:03.000
Next, we will briefly consider some of the main roles in the project team and their functions.

15:04.000 --> 15:24.000
Here on this slide you see an example of the organizational structure of the project team, or as we also say in project management, the Organization Breakdown Structure, OBS of the project.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
Or sometimes we say that we are talking about the project office of the project.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
There is also the concept of the project office of the enterprise, and we will discuss this aspect later.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Now we are talking about the project office of the project.

15:45.000 --> 15:57.000
Here is a structured hierarchical scheme of the team members, roles, subordinates,

15:57.000 --> 16:21.000
plus a table that carefully describes the functions of each role, plus information about the phone, fax, email, coordinates, physical coordinates of the location of this person.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
All this in total can be called a project office.

16:25.000 --> 16:44.000
In general, this structure describes the content of the entire team, and in this team, the red dots are those members who are engaged in management.

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
Management is a significant part of their functions.

16:53.000 --> 17:07.000
In general, together with this part of the project management team, other employees and performers make up the project team.

17:07.000 --> 17:29.000
If we talk about the hierarchical approach to the formation of this project structure, then the project experience shows that the method of unification in project management is more effective than the democratic management methods in the project team.

17:30.000 --> 17:53.000
For example, if we manage the project using a democratic method, a democratic body, let's say 12 people gather as a team and manage the project, then such an approach, such a technology will be less effective if one person manages the project.

17:54.000 --> 18:10.000
But at the same time, we must understand that the method of unification will be most effective if the head of the team is a high-level professional manager.

18:10.000 --> 18:25.000
He is able to manage the project, organize the work in the team and successfully achieve the goals of the project.

18:25.000 --> 18:45.000
In large and complex projects, the professionalism of the project manager is very much in demand.

18:45.000 --> 19:00.000
In such a situation, in tandem with the project manager, the owners of the enterprise or the management of the enterprise put the curator of the project.

19:00.000 --> 19:17.000
This role is most often introduced in projects where we are talking about a large-scale, large-capacity resources, large budget and high priority of the project.

19:17.000 --> 19:30.000
The management wants to insure the process of the project, because the project manager may not be professional enough.

19:30.000 --> 19:44.000
The situation may be similar to the situation in the Soviet Union, when the commissar worked with the commander.

19:44.000 --> 19:55.000
This analogy is not entirely justified, but nevertheless, there is this element of the commander and the commissar.

19:55.000 --> 20:10.000
Sometimes in some organizations, this tandem is introduced in such a way that the levers of project management are divided as follows.

20:10.000 --> 20:25.000
The project manager has administrative levers of management, and the curator of the project is financial and economic.

20:25.000 --> 20:45.000
The project manager is only engaged in administration, he can make suggestions and issue orders to change the team members, to introduce a certain role, to change functions, to divide functions, and so on.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
But in this situation, the curator is the actual manager of the budget.

20:54.000 --> 21:19.000
Sometimes the role of the curator combines the functions of a person who makes a responsible decision in the so-called stages of the project, or in significant points in time, or in the process of transition from one phase of the project to another.

21:20.000 --> 21:32.000
In English-speaking literature, this role is often called a gatekeeper.

21:32.000 --> 21:47.000
And from the point of view of project management, this is a person who really makes decisions when the project goes through these gates between phases, between one phase to another.

21:47.000 --> 22:07.000
If it is necessary to carefully and accurately analyze and justify the purposefulness of the project transition from one phase to another, justify the next costs of the budget, resources,

22:07.000 --> 22:23.000
then in this situation, the role of the curator of the project is already used, and the curator of the project has the authority to make decisions about the transition from one phase to another.

22:23.000 --> 22:38.000
Nevertheless, if the professionalism of the project manager is sufficient, then it is preferable to have a structure in which the philosophy of unanimity is used.

22:38.000 --> 22:52.000
This approach provides the maximum efficiency of the project, that is, the maximum return on investment, profitability, and maximum dividends.

22:52.000 --> 23:14.000
And then we consider the role of the project manager as the only responsible performer for the overall coordination, for the overall achievement of the project goal, for the overall success of the project implementation.

23:14.000 --> 23:27.000
Each project can be considered from the point of view of the subject area of design and the project management.

23:27.000 --> 23:40.000
The structure of the project team or organizational structure of the project can also be divided into two parts, the subject area and the project management.

23:40.000 --> 23:57.000
Both branches are subject to the project manager, and the subject branch is headed by an expert in complex projects.

23:57.000 --> 24:24.000
I emphasize that in this course we mainly consider complex projects, so that listeners can understand that for such types of projects, complex and complex, such techniques are used.

24:24.000 --> 24:37.000
And when it comes to less complex projects, you can always reduce all these technological and methodological costs.

24:37.000 --> 24:47.000
Therefore, we consider our projects from the point of view of complexity.

24:47.000 --> 24:59.000
In complex projects, we can always exclude the sub-projects, or we understand that any such complex project consists of individual bricks.

24:59.000 --> 25:17.000
And if we talk about the concept of the project, its result, product or service, then it can also be formed from separate modules in such projects.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
All this can be woven into a complex structure.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
And here the role of the expert is in demand.

25:26.000 --> 25:35.000
An expert is a responsible performer for the development of the architecture or concept of the project in the subject area.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
The next role is the chief engineer of the project, or often abbreviated as a HIP.

25:43.000 --> 26:01.000
The chief engineer of the project is responsible for the implementation of the concept of the project developed by the expert.

26:01.000 --> 26:23.000
The chief engineer of the project makes all these conceptual decisions, organizes technical decisions and directs the implementation of the project in separate directions.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
The next level, as you can see on the slide, is the engineers in separate directions.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
And they specialize in a narrower area.

26:36.000 --> 26:47.000
As we say, they are responsible for a separate project cell, for a separate component, or for the system, or for the project.

26:48.000 --> 26:56.000
And all this is about the subject component.

26:56.000 --> 27:14.000
For example, if we talk about the creation of a local computing network of a large building, let's say 18 floors, then this part consists of different subsystems.

27:14.000 --> 27:37.000
For example, horizontal and vertical SKS, active network equipment, server economy, workstations, basic software, applied software, up to the fact that it is used separately for the information security system.

27:38.000 --> 27:50.000
That is, this whole project in the subject area can be made up of separate modules, of separate subsystems.

27:50.000 --> 28:00.000
And the implementation of this project in the subject area is headed by a separate engineer for each component.

28:00.000 --> 28:12.000
And then the engineers of the brigade go to the executors, who implement the project.

28:12.000 --> 28:26.000
As for the branch of management, in complex projects, the role of the main project manager is usually highlighted, or GMP.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Sometimes this role is called the project's leading manager.

28:31.000 --> 28:43.000
If the project is really very complex and there are 50 people in the project team, sometimes there are 200 or more people in the project team,

28:43.000 --> 28:56.000
then the functions in the project are limited to a narrower volume, as we say, they are cut more narrowly.

28:57.000 --> 29:13.000
And then the roles in the project are limited by separate functions, and there are more and more of these roles.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
That is, depending on the scale of the project, we introduce one or another role.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
The larger the project, the more roles in the project team.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
The smaller the project, the fewer roles in the project team.

29:30.000 --> 29:38.000
It is clear that in a very simple project, the entire project team can be expressed in one person,

29:38.000 --> 29:49.000
and this person will combine the roles of the project manager, the expert, the chief engineer, the chief manager, and so on.

29:50.000 --> 30:03.000
But we said that we would consider projects that are complex and complex, and in these projects, the project teams are also quite large,

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
and the differentiation in functions, in roles, is quite narrow.

30:09.000 --> 30:23.000
In large projects, in some situations, the main project managers are also included as the managerial branch,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
this is the project manager.

30:25.000 --> 30:34.000
In this slide, the project is not so large-scale, and the branch of management of the project's main manager is headed there.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
And this project manager is subordinate to the following team members.

30:41.000 --> 30:52.000
This is the project administrator, coordinator, line managers, and other managers, for example, the manager-economist,

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
manager-lawyer, manager-security, and so on.

30:57.000 --> 31:05.000
It all depends on the project's functional orientation and how complex it is.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Now we will briefly discuss the main roles.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
So, the project administrator.

31:11.000 --> 31:21.000
This person is responsible for the implementation of the project turnover document.

31:22.000 --> 31:34.000
The project administrator is responsible for the organization, creation, and provision of the database,

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
which works with the turnover document, with the documentation.

31:40.000 --> 31:51.000
In enterprises without project management, and in which large and complex projects are implemented,

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
there are often conflicts of the following kind.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
For example, we have 50 people in the team, and one of the team members, the administrator,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
needed some document.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
And this person starts looking for who has this document.

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
In the end, he finds who is calling this person, and at the other end of the line, he answers,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
where are you? In Khurgada.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That is, he went on vacation.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Where is this document?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
In my safe.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh, damn, I forgot the key.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I have it here.

32:33.000 --> 32:42.000
And the situation is that we take the autogen, start cutting this safe, and there is no document.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
And the whole process is delayed.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
What is it?

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
This is a reduction in the project's efficiency.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Read ROI.

32:54.000 --> 33:01.000
It is clear that we are devaluing not only in the sense of profitability, but also other dividends.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
For example, the rename of the organization.

33:05.000 --> 33:14.000
If another legal entity has requested such a document, and we cannot find it within two weeks,

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
while we are positioned as general contractors, specialists in the field of management,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
it is clear what we are talking about.

33:23.000 --> 33:30.000
And how other legal and physical entities will react to us after that.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
In the same organizations where the project management system is present,

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
and where the project management system works, at least partially,

33:41.000 --> 33:50.000
other technologies are used to eliminate these shortcomings and sources of risk.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Management risks.

33:52.000 --> 34:02.000
In these organizations, as a rule, a database is formed for any complex project that is opening up.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
And it is formed very clearly and structurally.

34:07.000 --> 34:14.000
All sections are distributed and built in a certain hierarchy.

34:14.000 --> 34:25.000
All sections have a certain access right only to those participants who have a relationship to this section, and so on.

34:26.000 --> 34:35.000
This database includes all the documents that were developed in the initiation phase,

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
planning, execution of the project, and completion.

34:39.000 --> 34:47.000
That is, there are all the documents that describe the project, the project documentation.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
We put everything there.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
This database includes technical tasks, the technical work of the project,

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
the invoice, invoice accounts, financial and economic documentation,

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
correspondence, external and internal,

35:08.000 --> 35:16.000
templates, forms, and regulatory documents that relate to this project.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
In the West, many companies have a kind of electronic circulation document.

35:24.000 --> 35:37.000
And there, specialists have long come to the conclusion that this kind of circulation document is more effective, fast, and reliable.

35:37.000 --> 35:44.000
Let's say, if you use a paper circulation document, then, of course, it is a precious pleasure.

35:45.000 --> 35:56.000
Because all the documents that are on paper, of course, we can translate them into electronic form and use them in the electronic version.

35:56.000 --> 36:05.000
In many organizations in the West, there are no printers, no faxes, no other xero-copying equipment.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
In general, the circulation document is not paper.

36:09.000 --> 36:29.000
In this situation, the role of the project administrator is due to the fact that this person is engaged in the escort of the electronic circulation document, database, and so on.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
In Russia, we often use a mixed circulation document.

36:34.000 --> 36:46.000
For a number of reasons, we use both a paper and an electronic circulation document.

36:47.000 --> 37:02.000
Nevertheless, if an organization switches to project management methods, and if it strives to increase the performance of management,

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
then it understands that it cannot do without an electronic circulation document.

37:09.000 --> 37:20.000
And in this situation, the project administrator can use any documents, even if they are on paper, they are translated into electronic form.

37:21.000 --> 37:33.000
In this situation, if one of the team members needs a particular document, then, in accordance with the rights of access, he can take this document at any time.

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
He understands where it is, there is a clear description of the structure, database, circulation document scheme.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
In this situation, the efficiency of the production process increases significantly.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
The project administrator monitors the current state of the database.

37:55.000 --> 38:05.000
If a new document appears, it must be transferred to the database within a given time.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
The next role is the project coordinator.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
The project coordinator is usually responsible for two directions.

38:18.000 --> 38:41.000
The first direction is that this person, this role, functions as a function of the organization and the organization of events, discussions, meetings, etc.

38:42.000 --> 38:57.000
This person clarifies the initiative of the event, the agenda, who will make reports from which organizations,

38:57.000 --> 39:09.000
then he will agree with the participants, legal and physical persons, the time and place of this event.

39:09.000 --> 39:16.000
This person is responsible for the organization, he can be responsible for the organization of the event,

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
demonstration materials, distribution materials, up to the coffee break.

39:22.000 --> 39:38.000
And, of course, he is responsible for the result of this event, and this result is usually expressed in the protocol of the meeting or meeting.

39:39.000 --> 39:53.000
As we have already said, the management's axiom states that we must move from ambiguity to unambiguity.

39:53.000 --> 40:02.000
This means that such events as meetings must have some result at the end,

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
and this is often the protocol of meetings.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
In other words, there was no meeting without a protocol of meetings.

40:13.000 --> 40:26.000
That is, if we did not see the protocol of the meeting, then the resources that were spent on the implementation of this event were thrown into the wind.

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
This is from the point of view of the quality of the document, the turnover, accountability and the general business of the project.

40:36.000 --> 40:47.000
On the other hand, having received the protocol, the responsible performer, in this situation the coordinator of the project,

40:47.000 --> 40:57.000
is obliged to transfer this result to another process at the entrance, namely, to the project administrator.

40:57.000 --> 41:06.000
That is, the project administrator is obliged to receive the protocol and place it in the corresponding section of the database.

41:07.000 --> 41:14.000
You see that I, considering each of the roles of the team members,

41:14.000 --> 41:27.000
I start describing it with the main function, namely, I say that this role is the responsible performer for this or that function.

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
And on the example of the interaction of the coordinator and the administrator,

41:34.000 --> 41:43.000
we saw how one responsible performer transfers the result of his work to another responsible performer,

41:43.000 --> 41:51.000
and we understand that the processes of interaction and organization of work in the team are very important,

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
and we must carefully schedule, model and implement them.

41:58.000 --> 42:08.000
The second function of the project coordinator is most often the function that he is a responsible performer

42:08.000 --> 42:21.000
or is the entry point, as we often say, of the contact person for this project in this organization.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
I will remind you once again that if we consider a complex project,

42:26.000 --> 42:38.000
then, as a rule, a large number of legal entities, a large number of project participants take part in such projects.

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
For example, if we have an investor, a customer, a general contractor and several subcontractors,

42:46.000 --> 42:57.000
it is clear that for the organization of such a large number of enterprises, it is necessary to clearly distribute,

42:57.000 --> 43:06.000
and with whom we will interact on the issues of this project in such and such an organization.

43:06.000 --> 43:16.000
As a result, the project manager sends an information letter to all legal entities with information

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
that in such and such an organization, the request to contact such and such a person with all the issues,

43:23.000 --> 43:31.000
here are his coordinates, phone number, fax, email, even physical location,

43:31.000 --> 43:41.000
and then we have a systematic interaction between project participants, between legal entities.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
And this function is performed by the project coordinator.

43:47.000 --> 43:56.000
If the project is complex, then in the separate component of the subject area,

43:56.000 --> 44:09.000
the volume of organizational work increases to such an extent that the engineer is a specialist in the subject area.

44:09.000 --> 44:17.000
He cannot cope with all aspects of the organization in this project or in this subsystem.

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
For example, if we have an engineer in the field of network equipment,

44:25.000 --> 44:40.000
and this equipment is very large, then the main function of this role is to make a quality, professional specification for this equipment,

44:40.000 --> 44:50.000
so that this subsystem works reliably, so that it is viable and is coordinated with other subsystems.

44:51.000 --> 45:01.000
And the processes and events that are aimed at tracking the quality of the order of this equipment,

45:01.000 --> 45:09.000
so that there is no failure in the specification when placing this equipment on the order,

45:09.000 --> 45:18.000
so that there are minimum risks among the optimal suppliers,

45:18.000 --> 45:32.000
so that we have minimum risks in the configuration, delivery, sorting, testing, installation of this equipment on the final objects.

45:32.000 --> 45:41.000
Of course, this is a huge amount of work, and it is entrusted to the linear managers in this direction.

45:42.000 --> 45:51.000
As a rule, such linear managers work in tandem with linear engineers in the direction,

45:51.000 --> 46:01.000
and they provide this subsystem, this element of the project,

46:01.000 --> 46:11.000
organizing all processes that are aimed at achieving the general goal of the project.

46:12.000 --> 46:25.000
Thus, we have briefly considered the main roles of the project team members and their main functions.

46:30.000 --> 46:36.000
The third block of the project management discipline is the management process.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
I will briefly remind you what we mean by the process.

46:43.000 --> 46:49.000
We understand the next approach under the process approach.

46:51.000 --> 46:59.000
At the input, we have input information, input data, input resources.

46:59.000 --> 47:11.000
Then we convert these resources, information, data, through technologies, methods, tools and specialized resources.

47:11.000 --> 47:23.000
At the output of the process, we get the result, converted input resources, already in a new form, in a new quality or quantity.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
In general, if we turn to the general philosophy of our approach,

47:30.000 --> 47:42.000
we said at the very beginning that the basis of project management and the approach to projects is as follows.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
We consider the whole project as a single phenomenon.

47:47.000 --> 47:55.000
It is reasonable to consider the project management process as a single one.

47:56.000 --> 48:03.000
Although in many methods, methods and even national standards,

48:03.000 --> 48:16.000
we can see that the description of projects in methodological approaches applies the division of this phenomenon into separate components.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
It is said that several processes can be considered in a project.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
However, we understand that this is not quite a systematic approach.

48:29.000 --> 48:43.000
In our case, a systematic approach will be more effective when we consider the whole process of project management.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
I will briefly remind you what we understand under the systematic approach.

48:50.000 --> 49:02.000
First of all, under the systematic approach, we understand that we cover the phenomenon, the subject that we study,

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
with which we interact, on which we work, in full.

49:07.000 --> 49:14.000
We do not leave any details, all details are taken into account.

49:14.000 --> 49:22.000
This approach can be characterized from the point of view of the coverage.

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
That is, the systematic approach implements the coverage of the object of management.

49:31.000 --> 49:41.000
On the other hand, the systematic approach implies that we study the object of management or manage this object

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
according to a clearly defined strategic and tactical scheme.

49:48.000 --> 49:55.000
In practice, this is realized thanks to the created model of the process,

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
or often called the business process.

50:00.000 --> 50:12.000
Thus, the whole sequence of work on the object, interaction with the object, is clearly regulated and prescribed.

50:12.000 --> 50:19.000
And we can say in this case that we work systematically.

50:20.000 --> 50:30.000
Here are the main parcels when we consider the third block of the project management discipline, the management process.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
Usually, the project management process is divided into 5 stages.

50:37.000 --> 50:45.000
The first stage is initiation, the second is planning, the third is organization and control of the work,

50:45.000 --> 50:52.000
the fourth stage is analysis and regulation, and the fifth stage is completion.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
In short, if we give the general characteristics of these stages,

50:59.000 --> 51:14.000
we can say that the initiation stage allows us to approach the beginning of a particular process

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
or a process as a whole.

51:16.000 --> 51:25.000
At the initiation stage, we consider the strategic purpose of the beginning of the process,

51:25.000 --> 51:35.000
its justification, strategic approaches, technological solutions, methodological solutions.

51:35.000 --> 51:44.000
And in general, we consider whether we have the opportunity to successfully implement the project in the current situation,

51:44.000 --> 51:52.000
taking into account the external and internal factors of the project environment.

51:53.000 --> 51:59.000
All this is the content of the first stage, the initiation stage.

52:00.000 --> 52:10.000
The second stage is planning, the stage of the project management process,

52:10.000 --> 52:19.000
at which we determine how we will organize and execute the project.

52:20.000 --> 52:30.000
The next stage is the implementation of our planned developments,

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
organization and control of the work, and the solution of the tasks,

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
with which we achieve the goal of the project.

52:41.000 --> 52:54.000
During the implementation of these tasks, we carry out an analysis of their implementation and adjust it.

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
We make corrections in order to implement the project more effectively.

53:02.000 --> 53:12.000
Let me remind you that under the term efficiency, we understand that the return on investment,

53:12.000 --> 53:19.000
profitability, dividends will be maximum, that is, the costs will be minimal.

53:19.000 --> 53:26.000
This all applies to the fourth stage of the project management process,

53:26.000 --> 53:39.000
and the fifth stage includes the completion of the project and, in fact, everything related to the completion of the project,

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
not only the project, but also the individual parts of the project, or individual phases of the project, individual sub-processes.

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
That is, we draw up the results, create a final document, analyze the results,

53:55.000 --> 54:04.000
and draw conclusions and recommendations for the next actions,

54:04.000 --> 54:14.000
or for the implementation of sub-processes, or for the implementation of the next projects similar or adjacent to our field of activity.

54:14.000 --> 54:24.000
It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference between the division of the project into phases.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
Phases are related to the life cycle of the project,

54:30.000 --> 54:39.000
and the life cycle of the project and the phases of the project are, first of all, the quantities that affect the chronology,

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
the chronological development of the project, that is, the phases are tied to time.

54:45.000 --> 54:53.000
The stages of the project management process are directly tied to time,

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
and there is no direct dependence on the chronology.

54:57.000 --> 55:07.000
Here the division is based on the content, on the essence of the work that we are doing in the project.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
If we consider the stages of the project management process,

55:11.000 --> 55:22.000
then each of these five stages can prescribe, for example, the phase of planning the project, development,

55:22.000 --> 55:30.000
or the conceptual phase, or the phase of implementation, or the phase of completion.

55:30.000 --> 55:43.000
That is, we can consider each phase of the life cycle in this method, dividing it into five stages.
