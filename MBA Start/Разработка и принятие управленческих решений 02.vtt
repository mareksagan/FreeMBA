WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
So, colleagues, we considered

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.500
a very interesting point, which

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.180
concerned the methods of decision

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.980
making, paid attention,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.000
especially tried to consider

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080
the issues of collegial decision making.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.280
Let us finish everything with it, as

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.000
with a very important moment, summarize

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.100
a little, and move to the light of

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400
the saints of the management decision

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.140
on how to resourcefully provide

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.160
the decision, how to what to strive

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.820
for when making decisions, what

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.100
resource and so on.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.640
Here, questions arise in terms of the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.680
effectiveness of different ways of

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.720
making decisions.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.780
Of course, it turns out that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.940
the most effective function

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.660
is the way this business game.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.980
You can object, I often have

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.660
to hear such objections that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080
these business games, they got tired

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.460
of them, we were rushed to these

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.700
business games, every week a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.000
business game, there in such

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.900
a company was selling, every week

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.060
they were somewhere there

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.700
some games.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.740
The question is, if it is the sales

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.700
department, they are oriented for

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.300
the development of new markets, softly

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.640
speaking, the development, the capture

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.640
of new markets.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.860
How do they solve the task?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.780
Meeting to last one-and-

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.940
a-half, two-three-four hours and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.860
think how to do it?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.160
In the form of a game, of course.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.300
On the other hand, again, if someone was

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.760
tortured by games, business games, I have

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.980
a question, and not whether someone was

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.180
tortured by the meeting?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.960
Usually, there is a difference,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.880
of course, because in the game

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.140
you need to stress, you need

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.480
to think, do something, get

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.820
some result, gain knowledge,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.320
generate some ideas, defend

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.100
your point of view.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.200
At the meeting, activity can be simulated.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.900
You can sit, listen, yes, I agree,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.040
and that’s all.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.940
Or I disagree, or do not justify anything.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520
But I feel that it is not so.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.000
I intuitively feel that it is not so.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.780
Without calculations, without everything, without justification.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.740
There is difference.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.060
And here it is clear that if the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.460
company can conduct brain attack

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.040
itself, although you can invite

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400
the organizers of brain attack,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.900
it is not a matter of course, for

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.160
business games, before we master

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.720
them, you need to pick up such

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.600
a candidacy that will conduct

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.260
with the maximum efficient

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.820
use of time, so that in that unit

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.120
of time while a production

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.060
task, operational or strategic,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.420
was solved, so that it was possible

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.960
at this time and maximize

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.960
the second layer, the game

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.540
layer, which teaches, combines

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660
and so on, and customizes

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.440
the company.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.020
The game layer that relates

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.940
to the training system.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.820
Maybe there are moments.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.520
Now another question about

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.120
the effectiveness of group adoption

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520
when the American model came

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.120
to us, defeated us in Moscow,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.580
the meetings themselves became

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.540
not very relevant.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.440
And those training sessions that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.840
are recommended somewhere,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.920
are being developed

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.120
there, are being proposed, in principle,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.500
they are already principally outdated,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.180
just as outdated, say, steam

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.360
cars at their time.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.340
The vessels can be used today.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.520
Yes, you can not only go to museums,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.160
not only ride the public on the rails at

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.080
the holidays in the park somewhere,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.900
but nevertheless they are already energy

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.600
inefficient and sent to the museum

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.880
for spare routes.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.980
The same can be said with the meeting,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.040
yes, they can be used, yes,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.880
in principle, sometimes they

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.600
are needed, sometimes they are even

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.800
useful, but as such, their

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.300
effectiveness, that is,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300
the feasibility of their use is

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.000
not so high.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.440
If we compare the two decision-

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.760
making models we looked at on

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.980
the example, which looked at the American

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.320
model and the Eastern one, where

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440
there was the Italian mafia and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.240
our structure was Soviet.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.880
If we compare the speed of implementation

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.380
decision making, of course,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.480
the American way of making decisions

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.740
is winning.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.360
On the other hand, if we compare the standard

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.340
of living of those Soviet officials

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.600
who made the decision, and the standard

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.720
of life of those bosses who

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.440
made the decision in that described

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.220
situation, it is clear which of

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280
them lives better.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.380
They will probably benefit from

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.700
a common model, including decision-making.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.440
Although the question is controversial, yet

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.180
there is something to think about.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.340
And it is interesting that when

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.000
everyone makes decisions in the measure

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.060
of their competence, in the measure

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.400
of their powers, in the same example

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.380
as the Italian mafia, the chief

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.560
boss of his organization may actually

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.540
be concerned about taking

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.660
only two decisions.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.120
All other decisions are made by those

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.640
who are to take them – the middle

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.520
and lower levels of management.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.100
He only makes two decisions – whether

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.520
to start a war with the Seventh

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.660
Clan or not, if any complicated

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.660
relationships, go for

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.480
negotiations and so on.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.580
The second question is, when it comes

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.060
to the liquidation or neutralization,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.480
to say gently, of the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.460
law enforcement officer.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.060
No one makes these decisions

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.680
except the chief.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.060
The rest of the decisions, he does

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.000
not do them, they do those who are

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.620
responsible.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.980
In principle, this is the principle of

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.220
delegation of powers, to which we try

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.560
to come, and sooner or later we

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.260
will come to know that everyone is

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.980
only engaged in their own decisions.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.440
But the chief boss has time to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.000
think about strategic issues.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.780
How to develop the organization further?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.580
In which direction to move?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.240
Because current internal issues are

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.300
decided by those who are responsible.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.380
He is more concerned with perspective,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.500
strategy, and so on.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.320
Now, my friends, let’s go

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.100
to the most interesting.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.880
What do we do when making decisions?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.760
Here in many organizations there

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.680
is the same error, unfortunately,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.120
in our country, and not only

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.760
in ours.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.520
We said that management decisions

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.040
can be divided into one system

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.100
of division, it is

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.160
periodic and not periodic.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.940
There are periodic management

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.560
decisions that require periodic

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.780
management decisions that

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.980
arise for one simple reason.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.200
When the assembled persons,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.360
individual or collective

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.220
decision-makers, are engaged in

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.060
the elimination of some of the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.280
consequences.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.120
They fight with the consequences, not with

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.900
the cause.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.760
They try to solve problems once and for all.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.920
All boundaries, all busy with work,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.500
everything they do, make decisions,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.020
consult, make papers, calculate

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.300
something, but constantly eliminate

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.000
these are the consequences.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.400
If we take an example from life,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.320
yes, we take medicine, that is,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.360
our doctors usually eliminate

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.080
the consequences of some disease.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.320
There is something in a person with a stomach,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.620
yes, they gave him pills, like there

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.170
gastritis passed, well.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.650
But a person has kept a lifestyle,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.810
he still drinks Coca-Cola,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.550
Pepsi, uses alcoholic beverages,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.690
so, spicy such food is used

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.770
by everything.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.270
After a while, he returns

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.170
to the doctors with the same.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.370
And again, they eliminate

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.650
the effects of exacerbation of

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.530
his gastritis, again leading

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.990
to fading, to cessation of attacks.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.050
You need to remove the cause.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.470
Looking back a little,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.590
as in many organizations.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.810
Suppose there are monthly at the

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.890
end of a quarter or at the end

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.950
of a month, especially in Soviet times,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.430
were aurals.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.170
Everyone was kicking, performing,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.970
day and night knocking hammer, producing

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.970
foods to fulfill the plan.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.210
Yes, it was done, but it was

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.910
a system error, a system problem

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.590
that could be solved systemically.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.730


00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.790
To make employees material dependence

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.210
on the rhythm of work, so that they

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.850
work at the same rhythm constantly.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.790


00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.350
That is, that there are plans

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.630
not just quarterly, but weekly,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.950
that weekly plans are executed.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.690
Then it is clear, in our country, well,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.530
and in others, too, it is not excluded,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.990
there would be small aurals at the end of the week.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.830
There would be many, but they would be small.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.530
Not as global as “we are presenting

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.230
the end of the quarter,” we need to

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.430
develop a plan, and here two

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.630
people fell ill from a brigade that

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.110
had only five people, two welders,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.150
for example.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.690
I need to cook something there.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.390
This is a disaster for the company.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.530
This is a whole brigade, that is,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.730
the company will remain without a prize.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.210
Where to find a way out?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.550
Again, only in eliminating the

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.990
cause of these aurals.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.390
And when making decisions, first of

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.290
all, I am often asked, but there

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.290
is a need to make a decision, we

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.930
want to do it.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.850
The question why we need to answer

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.250
ourselves for what and why we want

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.490
to do something because back to the first

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.310
minutes of our meeting when we

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.090
asked what is a management

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.210
decision it is first of all the

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.550
choice of a goal here this choice

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.370
of a goal allows us to avoid a lot

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.110
if the goal is chosen socially approved

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.570
by the whole team and broken

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.850
down into tasks under tasks then

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.490
it is easier to go to it then

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.470
remove intermediate some moments

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.550
that lead to disharmony and unnecessary

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.930
processes management decisions.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.530
That is, again, to reduce the cost of

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.970
managerial work on decision-making,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.190
you need to simply technologically

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.690
in the organization of the work cycle

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.930
of the organization itself to remove

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.930
those moments that lead to a

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.430
constant some annoying effect to

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.850
find their cause and to eliminate

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:04.120
once all yes this is what about the

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.060
causes and consequences that is to

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.020
say we find the cause we eliminate

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.740
it further work systematically until

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.800
this problem has arisen again

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.540
in this problem we look for the

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.140
reason why it arose increased

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.900
conflicts in the organization why

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.000
may these conflicts will be possible

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.680
without end to train on non-conflictology

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.640
and train employees to work

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.760
in the conditions of conflict,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.920
you can without end.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.840
On the other hand, you can find out

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.600
if this is caused by the fact that some

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.000
new cadres were adopted, initiating

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.400
conflicts, right?

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.600
And something to do with them, talk to them,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.060
take them out of the state, and so on,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.280
some measures to take once, right?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.460
On the other hand, these conflicts

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.640
may be caused by a change in leadership style.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.500
Maybe they are caused by the fact

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.820
that the information is spread somehow

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.100
not rhythmically, not exactly,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.260
that official information is

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.580
not enough and people are nervous,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.940
or maybe it is the reason for the

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.680
rapid growth of the organization,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.800
and you just need to adjust the

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.340
staff policy, restructure and

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.200
accordingly change the organizational

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.100
culture, corporate culture,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.360
instead of ordering endless

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.380
training on conflict

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.480
elimination.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.120
After all, you can eliminate conflicts

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.040
through training, maybe quite easy

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.560
and simple, but expensive.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.840
And this does not affect, they are less, it

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.280
does not become, although they are conducted

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.920
in this way.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.300
Now on to.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.800
Even more interesting is the moment.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.660
When making decisions, we usually

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.480
said that there is, say, a third group

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.040
in the brain attack, and in general,

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.500
in the scheme itself there is

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.540
a stage when a solution is chosen,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.780
the resource supply of each possible

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.740
option is justified, and something

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.160
of them is chosen

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.400
and implemented.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.320
As a rule, any organization,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.080
if we talk about the optimal

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.740
solution, tries to the desired

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.560
result by minimizing the

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.260
use of available resources.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.330
What resources?

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.550
Financial,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.350
material and technical resources,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.730
energy resources, administrative

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.410
resources, human

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.270
resources.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.670
Furthermore, as a resource, you

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.290
can connect, education, creative

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.210
abilities, desires.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.610
The desire of the team members, the

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.010
desire of the employees to a goal.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.970
That is resources.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.670
Resources are usually lacking.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.770
First of all, we also have to listen

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.570
now, but we don’t have money, we have

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.230
money, if we had money, we would have

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.410
all the issues solved.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.050
In fact, since the Soviet Union

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.290
moved on to the path of restructuring,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.390
acceleration and market economy,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.810
we have fallen into a system where

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.750
the most important deficit is

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.130
the deficit of money.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.270
This is not new in the world

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.590
is not enough money this is the

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.650
number one resource for which actually

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.730
speaking and is created enterprise

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.050
to earn money to get profit income and

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.870
here, of course, when making

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.910
management decisions you need to

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.570
develop such schemes so that without

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.510
spending, that is, by investing

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.930
resources at a minimum we get the

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.910
maximum return if We return to the

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.110
formula of Karl Max, to the formula

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.150
of capitalist production, that

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.870
money is turned into commodity,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.010
and it is turned into

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.670
money-shredder, where as money-

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.450
shredder - it is the original

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.650
money plus delta-money.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.510
We need to strive for the

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.310
delta money to be as much as

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.270
possible, and the initial money invested

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.390
as little as possible, so that for

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.150
each ruble invested they receive

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.030
a return of 10 100 thousand rubles

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.830
a million and then from this

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.830
for every million that we received

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.750
we invested 10 rubles 1 ruble

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.950
1 tenth ruble or 1 hundred rubles

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.930
here is already the highest decision

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.240
making pilot but this is not

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.060
yet the highest pilot the highest

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.480
pilot when we invest zero, and

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.840
we get millions when we don’

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.800
t invest anything.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.700
Such management decisions are

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.000
probably already out of the

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.480
best, most desirable solutions.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.420
When an organization does not

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.260
have any resources, not only money,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.440
but material and technical

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.920
resources, cars, these are production

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.540
capacities, these are buildings,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.540
these are computers, the same.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.480
I forgot to say that information

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.980
resources are needed to introduce

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.800
information wars, to inform the

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.240
population about a potential

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.380
consumer, about something,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.500
about the organization.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.680
And if we translate it with

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.900
this formula of capitalist

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.040
production to all other

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.580
resources, it is desirable

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.180
to make such decisions, and

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.920
let us strive to the

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.380
maximum possible result

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.280
by investing zero resources.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.560
This would be considered the top

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.280
pilot of management activity.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.560
And if the management decision

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.600
is a product of management

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.540
activity, then this is the orientation

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.680
of how to act.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.900
Let us look at the example.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.840
Let us return to the one we have already

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.520
looked at.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.620
The example is Thomas Sawyer.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.730
Hero of America, without investing anything,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.100
achieved the solution of the task

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.130
and received additional resources

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.030
in the form of toys, apples and so on.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.770
On the one hand, this is an example

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.950
of how you can work in a lack

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.890
of resources.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.630
Now let us further aggravate

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.110
this situation and try to

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.470
increase the professionalism

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.550
of the decision-maker even more.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.130
That is, we’ve just talked about

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.290
that when we don’t have resources

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.830
and we get something, it’s the highest

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.450
pilot when we don’t

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.030
have resources.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.070
Not even with zero

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.950
investment.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.950
And now let’s consider the option

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.350
when we can get something, Not just by investing

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.500
nothing, but having a minus there

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.180
instead of zero, when we don’

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.380
t have resources, we lack

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.420
that resource.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.660
That is, when we talked about that assessor,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.080
he had a paint, had a brush, he could

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.520
paint the fence himself, but he did

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.060
it with other people's hands.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.300
That is, he had a resource, a

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.240
minimum investment in paint, he himself

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.580
invested his intellectual resources

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.060
and got the result.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.720
In principle, it could even be

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.740
said in a different way, to transfer

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.020
him to another class of even higher

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.800
pilot when making a management

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.360
decision, that he did not have

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.160
the desire to paint the fence,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.820
there was no desire.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.360
And this lack of desire prompted

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.300
him to the fact that this desire

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.580
appeared in those who painted

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.240
the fence and gave it their toys.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.590
That is, the lack of a resource

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.450
has become a resource.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.030
Now another example, more clear,

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.210
more rigid in this respect.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.810
Once upon a time, again, in the

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.870
Soviet era, there was a system

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.610
called the SEF – Council of

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.490
economic mutual assistance.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.310
And all the countries of the

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.470
CEF somehow gathered,

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.170
because we had electricity produced

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.550
mainly in the Soviet Union, the

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.130
countries in Eastern Europe

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.330
were less powered, and since

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.850
the Soviet Union was a big

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.450
country, and so we made

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.770
this decision together,

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.210
let us do so.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.710
We sell electricity

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.390
to each other.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.310
Let us sell.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.170
That is, from east to west, to

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.530
push the energy west to east and

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.070
so on.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.290
We will put the counts, we will...

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.950
Okay, that is to say, everyone does that.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.090
They sell each other, put the

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.030
counters and calculate.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.630
But here a clever decision was made.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.650
Let’s put two-rate counters.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.170
When the electricity...

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.770
We know that there are

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.050
power loads and peaks.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.850
Somewhere from 6 to 8

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.990
am the peak of electricity consumption

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.510
hostess get up include plates

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.410
there heated light bulbs especially

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.030
in winter people are going to

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.490
be shaved there and so on all

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.590
going to work go in transportation

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.990
enabled electricity city

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.290
consumes a lot of energy that

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.230
is, peak electrons the same peak

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.450
in the evening and day and night

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.110
failures here let's have in

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.690
the night we will be cheap

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.390
electricity accident peak

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.550
expensive put two-rate meters

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.730
on the borders of the states

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.790
and the year worked in this

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.310
mode of electricity sold received

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.390
and so on someone needed

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.690
a year looked at the bills

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.950
asked analyzed told no

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.650
all so that they said

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.890
the Soviet Union was supposedly

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.950
left in their interests

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.350
so there is nothing but

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.810
so-so-so-so-so-so-

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.050
so-so-so-so-so-so-so-

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.390
so-so-so-

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.610
They during the year on

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.890
the counter that shows consumption

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.630
and sales, they bought more

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.590
than they sold.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.950
They don’t have enough electricity,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.350
they buy more.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.650
It lacks its own.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.190
They bought electricity.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.090
And by the price counter, where

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.330
the money, they should have got money.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.990
It is amazing.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.590
The lack of electricity

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:17.240
allowed them to earn from selling

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.140
and buying electricity.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.520
How did they do it?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.040
They simply moved the start of

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.660
the working day on a state-

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.080
wide scale by 2 hours.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.600
While they were sleeping, they were getting

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.940
up, going to work, driving.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.260
And when everyone started to go

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.520
to work, they at this time already

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.720
had a drop in load.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.780
In the morning the same evening here

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.900
is such a simple example now there

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.680
are examples of the relationship

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.500
between resources with each other, that

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.500
is, we approached the fact that

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.500
we need to work without resources, lack

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.100
of resources to turn into a resource,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.560
well here is the example now then

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.880
we will understand it so that we

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.540
show it was and in Soviet times

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.320
remained and in Russian time We know

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.600
that every country is forced,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.160
whether it wants it or not, every

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.440
time in this country to

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.120
produce iron.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.420
It is sinked in the house ore, there

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.160
are still necessary components

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.880
in it, a high temperature

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.500
isined, the ore melts.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.380
And from time to time, iron

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.740
is poured into the wagonette, it will

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.860
be rolled over, spilled on its necessary

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.020
devices, with which the preparations

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.660
are poured out for further

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.620
processing.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.980
So here is what a difficulty, that as

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.240
soon as the extruded iron

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.440
is poured into the wagonette,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.760
it begins to contact with oxygen.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.020
The formula of this iron is iron, ferrum.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.500
At a temperature of about

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.900
1500 degrees, iron is oxidized.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.020
And while the liquid iron is in the

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.620
wagon, the top is covered with a

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.510
shell of oxide.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.790
First, this crust must be eliminated

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.250
in some way when translating, Second,

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.030
it is marriage, iron oxide, that is,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:09.370
the loss of metal in the process itself.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.110
I thought about how to avoid it.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.470
They thought, they thought, they thought.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.930
Close the cover, make a vacuum

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.590
over the car.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.030
That is, it is troublesome, then expensive,

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.110
then difficult to organize, because the

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.270
wagons are moving, something had

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.690
to be done.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.390
I thought we found a technical

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.870
solution.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.010
It is poured into the iron and sleep

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.650
it from above.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.790
When the iron is formed, the garbage does not float

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.010
from above into the house.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.550
When the iron fuses, the garbage is thrown

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.490
somewhere too.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.190
Previously, they were engaged in its recycling,

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.050
putting it into waste, recycling

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.070
some to eliminate.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.230
Now decided not to process this

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.790
garbage, partly, at least, cover

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.230
it with a layer of liquid

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.730
iron from the top.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.370
that is, once he this sludge he was

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.350
and in the dome he is here on

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.000
top he eliminates oxygen contact

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.340
and consequently loss escapes

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.880
losses of the supply and we

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.720
avoid getting the shell 2 that

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.740
is, iron normally spills the sludge

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.180
again float on top cleansing

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.700
smells there already by a technical

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.720
device it is much easier

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.480
and cheaper all that is we again

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.480
found the waste that became

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.540
useful to use, and not

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.400
just the waste that was a zero

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.240
resource, and those waste that

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.840
had to be recycled and on their

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.520
recycling and destruction to spend

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.280
resources, that is, here is the

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.460
technical solution that allows

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.500
the minus to turn into a plus,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.140
now on, let's try, yes, this

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.200
technical solution has been

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.460
further turned into a management,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.580
in an organizational decision,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.640
that is, it was necessary

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.180
to pack this iron

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.540
in a vacuum each time,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.440
here to store it

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.920
And here someone has thought of

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.580
such a solution that changes

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.240
technology, and let’s say, we will

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.840
put this garbage on the bottom

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.640
in empty wagons, it’s light.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.300
The wagon enters, fills with iron,

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.610
the garbage rises up itself, so that

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.770
it does not fall asleep, and it is easier

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.530
to fill an empty wagon, all some

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.150
huge devices are put in, inside

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.170
it no longer appears.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.090
He goes in, goes to sleep,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.830
goes on, and all the same.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.270
Here is an example of an organizational

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.790
solution that implements our

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.330
technical solution.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.270
Further on resources.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.430
Information resources play a

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.290
major role in the organization today.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.930
Especially in an organization that works

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.630
in the market, with consumers, even private,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.810
even corporate, it is

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.950
the presence of a website, the presence

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.130
of an email address for correspondence,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.010
the presence of ACQ.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.670
When Belarusians came to us last year,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.690
they wanted to go to the Moscow

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.390
market, they asked to help,

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.890
we need to go out.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.550
The Moscow City Council was addressed by a official.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.850
The question is, how do I keep in touch with you?

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.190
They give a visit card, there

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.070
is no email address, nor internet.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.050
How to connect with them?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.450
No anyway.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.590
We are sent by fax to all of the offers.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.610
Who would fax today?

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.170
Then he passed, then he didn’t pass,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.450
then it was expensive, it can be

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.890
long, uncomfortable when there

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.370
is an email.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.330
They are not ready to

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.910
develop their information.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.030


00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.590
The decision to go to another market.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.030
Yes, we have good quality,

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.210
high quality products.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.130
We know that in Belarus is

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.690
traditionally high quality

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.230
of trimming, high quality

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.390
of light industry products,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.950
high quality of food products.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.710
You come and ask, do you

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.050
have ISO standards?

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.630
No is.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.730
Why did you come to us?

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.430
You are another country.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.910
We have a high quality, but high.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.670
Now again, the information provision

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.370
of their decisions to enter our

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.070
market is not worked out.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.310
That is to say, we should have information

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.730
that we have ISO standards.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.590
We are here to compete, we want to compete.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.250
I hear objections.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.590
We don’t have the internet, we don’t have it.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.330
Okay, well, there is no optical fiber.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.030
You can not have this site constantly

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.790
maintain there are free sites

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.470
opened it there created and let

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.670
it hang but update it once

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.870
a month allow or once in

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.710
two where there are 34 pages

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.070
literally people can open to

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.050
ensure the activity

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.670
and company well there is not

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.550
something there we do not know

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.490
there but you do not need

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.030
once this neighbors open let

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.550
hanging email the same we have

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.430
no wires on and spent still

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.790
there is a phone Well we have

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.690
this phone node so station

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:37.950
old that they can not provide,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.750
well well, take mail

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.910
in principle enough

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.370
twice a week.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.110
You can arrange with the school

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.570
or even go with someone,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.690
rent these for an hour or two

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.950
hours a week at a club,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.790
internet club, internet cafe,

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.870
and send an employee to

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.370
take the email, you can.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.550
That is, so much, and we in Russia have

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.550
a lot, in the province the habit

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.510
of thinking has already warmed

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.490
the habit of thinking, that

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.870
is, we approach the psychological foundations

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.270
of paralytic decisions.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.190
So much of the habit of thinking

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.690
is standard, that is, routine.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.710
Again, it’s not just my criticism

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.530
of someone.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.210
This is a general system,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.270
it is the qualification of our management

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.230
that we cannot, very hard to

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.530
go beyond the usual decisions.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.710
If we have always done this,

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.790
let’s do it here.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.470
It was not from the internet.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.830
When it happens, we will start.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.850
It is not necessarily possible to go

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.070
somewhere to get this resource, as

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.530
a resource to ensure the adoption and

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.330
implementation of some management decisions.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.490
Now, if we go on, there is a very

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.130
interesting moment that I promised

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.490
to tell you from the beginning.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.250
It is making the right decisions.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.570
Speaking of resource support of

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.190
management solution, one point

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.930
must be noted, that is, we are

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.050
returning again to the optimal solution.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.550
Sometimes it happens, even it happens

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.410
often, just we don’t know about

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.950
it, such situations when

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.810
the optimal solution we need,

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.050
the optimal result, we can’t.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.470
Well, for some reason we can not,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.470
or we can, but at a very high

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.050
cost of available resources.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.210
This happens often.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.370
There is a question, well we are used

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.890
to thinking so, here we need to, before

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.550
we have to do it, and we start doing.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.290
We are spending some resources,

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.990
but we are achieving the task.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.950
This was normal in those conditions

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.990
when we didn’t have resources, when

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.190
we were the richest country and,

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.270
actually, nobody was responsible

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.010
for anything.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.010
In a situation where everyone makes a

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.310
decision, the American model, and

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.870
everyone is responsible for their decision,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.290
it makes sense to consider

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.650
other options to the set goal.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.150
That is, we were given the task

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.710
of reaching some resource, reaching

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.190
some goal.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.610
We calculate the resource

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.110
provision, look, ah, we can’

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.110
t get in.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:05.330
Let’s look at other options,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.730
or maybe we’re not getting

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.730
to the goal.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.850
We can’t get to, let’s say, and

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.910
we didn’t get to the goal of

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.790
5%, right?

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.230
But 20% of the available resources

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.970
were saved, that is, they achieved that

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.870
95% target for 80% of resources.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.110
Beneficial and profitable.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.670
Why not change the original goal and

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.710
not make it different that prevents if

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.230
it is profitable does not interfere

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.470
with anything or vice versa you can

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.270
try to step a little further

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.930
than this goal, let us get 101

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.010
percent of the result, so it is achieved

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.810
we will spend 95 percent of the

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.710
resource but to 100 percent

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.010
of the result we will

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.970
spend 100 percent of the resource.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.350
There are such extreme points, we

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.230
know it, right?

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.750
There are extremes.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.230
That is, discussing some solution

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.050
and, looking at, choosing from

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.590
options, you need to consider those

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.710
solutions that lie next to.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.230
Those moments that lie near the

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.690
point where we should be.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.130
A little closer, a little further away.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:15.610
well well.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.490
Now about the right and wrong decisions.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.530
As I said, only the

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.530
right decisions are made.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.410
Since when?

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.810
Once I read the book of Vladimir Tarasov,

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.390
director of the Tallinn School

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.050
of Managers, “Personal Technology”.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.250
There he had a number of tasks that

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.150
I use with references to the developer.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.630
And including was an interesting

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.170
thought he had, I do not

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.670
shy away to repeat, that all the

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.910
decisions that the LPR or

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.390
manager makes are correct.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.990
My rhetorical question of whether the

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.030
president made the right decision,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.370
having recently resigned the

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.590
government, is the answer to

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.190
such a “right decision.”

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.280
We are just used to our mentality,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.800
again, in our management qualifications,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.800
not to question managers,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.120
to assess decisions correct

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.480
and wrong.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.900
Let us agree once a hour

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.200
that all the decisions we have

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.520
made are right.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.760
And now we will evaluate not

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.960
the decision itself,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.620
but its consequences.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.580
And if the decision we have made to

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.640
ensure the achievement of the goal

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.280
with the minimum use of resources,

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.400
it does not mean that this decision

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.020
is beneficial to us as a whole.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.040
Every decision taken in

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.900
its implementation has

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.200
consequences.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.180
These consequences are

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.360
both positive and negative.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.940
They are close and distant.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.140
That is, if we draw it in the form of

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.560
a matrix, we will see that the consequences

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.700
of decisions lie on the matrix.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:19.180
On the one hand, these are close

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.660
positive consequences and

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.000
distant positive consequences.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.720
The immediate negative consequences

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.140
of our decision and the distant

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.040
negative consequences of our decision.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.700
When we fill out the

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.880
implications of the quadricism

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.140
on this matrix, we can

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.980
then analyze them.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.400
What more, what less?

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.060
Whether this solution is beneficial

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.120
to us in the future, or it is

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.280
only beneficial today in terms

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.200
of the cost of resources, it

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.000
is in any case correct and when

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.900
we choose the most low-cost solution

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.620
today, which requires a minimum

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.840
investment in resources, and

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.420
even better when it is not necessary

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.580
to invest resources, and even

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.900
better when the resource

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.760
is the lack of resources and

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.080
when the planned result will

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.860
have more positive

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.860
decisions, both close and

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.820
remote.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.460
And these positive consequences

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.260
will considerably outweigh the

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.400
negative consequences.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.980
Then we can talk about

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.460
choosing one option.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.180
A simple example.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.700
A person makes a career, has completed

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.160
an MBA course, he is invited by two

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.060
organizations, in one he already works.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.960
He has to decide to stay

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.620
or move.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.200
All these decisions are correct, leaving

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.640
one organization is correct, staying

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.780
in the organization is

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.560
correct, leaving the next organization

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.000
is also correct.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.520
For each decision, a matrix of the

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.360
consequences is made of those that

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.100
were depicted on the slide, where that

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.020
Person writes the consequences

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.040
of those decisions.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.960
First of all, we will agree that neither

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.420
of these solutions needs to provide

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.740
resources, somewhat significant,

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.620
that is, and there, and there,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.500
in three points he can

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.760
get without using any resources.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.880
That is, there, everywhere he is

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.520
invited, he has not communicated

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.380
with anyone, well, the normal situation.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.320
And here, after filling out these three

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.560
matrix, the person planning his career

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.940
begins to evaluate their

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.840
positive and negative consequences.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.560
I think all decisions are correct.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.640
We are also taught when building

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.500
a career to judge decisions,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.700
right or wrong, about moving

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.780
somewhere.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.020
That is, large lists are made, proximity

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.400
to the workplace, flexible schedule,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.920
the possibility of travel,

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.020
the possibility of improving qualifications

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.180
and so on.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.580
Many parameters, they are evaluated

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.160
on a 5- or 10-point scale are calculated,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.560
yes, this is, in fact, inconsequence,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.360
these are the pros of momentary

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.620
solutions, that is, today, that

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.740
is, this is the point

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.600
that you can choose.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:33.100
Here, having compiled three tables

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.700
on resources for these three

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.380
options, how much to get before

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.820
work, what long leave, what

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.100
salary, and so on, having evaluated

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.060
all in a single scale, Man

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.080
chooses the most acceptable

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.080
solution for himself,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.120
which is the desired point

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.200
X.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.580
And here it is from it that we

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.120
must start considering this most

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.440
beneficial option today – the consequences.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.140
After all, in the other option, the

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.480
seven-minute benefits may be less,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.580
but the positive effects are generally

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.990
greater, both close and remote.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:11.920
Of course yes?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.540
Now,, we have learned to make positive

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.020
decisions, the right decisions

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.280
in our lives, in our activities,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.000
and it is time for us to move

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.540
on to how people make decisions.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.500
We considered decision-making, and

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.380
these heuristic creative methods

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.200
were considered more or less in detail.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.360
Mathematical methods we decided not to

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.780
consider, they are given in textbooks,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.480
many of them, these methods.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.700
And now we approach the methods

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.500
that are most often used on the

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.520
ferrally line of control.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.520
These are willful, intuitive,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.820
intuitive-logical, as they are called,

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.280
and so on, in different ways.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.820
That is, any manager starts his

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.340
career, usually from the first

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.300
line, from the lower management.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.800
And success in his promotion depends

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.120
on how he can contact

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.180
those who are above him in his

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.560
position, organize the work

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.400
of his subordinates and contact

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.200
with the same festival managers

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.940
who are with him in the neighborhood,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.600
with whom he coordinates

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.840
plans, develops projects, comes

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.000
together to a meeting,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.440
planners to his mid-manager.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.020
Therefore, a big role in his life

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.160
plays how a person makes decisions,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.940
in what ways.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.620
Knowing the ways of making decisions,

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.580
how a person takes them, here

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.680
you can plan the decision he should

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.740
take, bring him information

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.900
so that he has taken the decision

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.960
we need, it will still be correct

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.080
in any case, the decision we

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.380
need, if it is not very contrary

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.840
to the interests of the

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.100
organization.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.280
And that it would be clear to the person

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.680
who agrees with us, and, in

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.060
fact, does not cause him any

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.720
insults.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.080
Maybe he said something bad.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.240
Let’s talk about these psychological

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.200
features of decision-

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.460
making.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.780
In principle, they are important,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.640
these features, and at the top level of

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.800
management, and on the middle.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.760
They are important outside our

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.840
organization when we communicate with

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.600
our competitors, with our business

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.760
partners, even within the family.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.240
When we communicate with our

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.680
wife, husband, children, parents,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.120
knowing how a person makes

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.380
decisions will help us

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.260
much greater results in life.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.860
So let’s start by considering.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.040
First of all, how different types of

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.760
decisions are made according to

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.760
Jung's typology.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.540
Here are four pairs of personal

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.380
preferences that define a person’

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.100
s life.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.940
The first pair is extrovert and introvert.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.700
It has no importance for decision

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.620
making.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.780
Although extrovert, though introvert,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.120
this function does not work on

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.380
decision making.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.860
Some people prefer to talk,

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.520
especially at meetings,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.240
while others prefer to be silent

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.120
at the same meetings.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.220
The first are extroverts,

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.560
the second are introverts.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.980
The second pair of preferences are

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.720
sensory and intuitive types.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.660
To explain the purpose and task of our

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.800
colleague sensory we need to pay attention

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.420
to the details of the proposed

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.580
options, those that are momentary,

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.920
that is, the little things,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.640
details, details.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.020
When he knows them, it is

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.520
easier to make a decision than

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.320
if we were to tell him about

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.080
the prospects, about some

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.640
big big challenges that fit in.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.500
For him, it is better to break down

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.460
a large task into small tasks,

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.100
on subtasks and work with small

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.000
subtasks that are extremely clear.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.640
It is easy to make decisions in such

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.420
situations.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.440
For a person with the predominance

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.100
of the intuitive type of thinking, it is

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.400
better to talk about prospects, about

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.760
the globality of projects, about opportunities.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.760
He understands this, and it is easier

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.080
for him to make a decision.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.100
It works easier with whole

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.580
images, with whole projects and programs.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.160
Talk about strategies and

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.780
so on.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.180
So what can we do of

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.140
this for the planet?

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.800
First, we know what to talk about

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.660
with different people, different types,

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.220
right?

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.440
On the other hand, when we

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.900
form a group to make a decision,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.160
we know that both are needed.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.860
That is, when forming a group

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.040
for a meeting, a seminar or a business

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.120
game, we need to consider that

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.360
we need both intuitive types who

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.220
see the whole information,

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.120
and sensors who can break it into

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.640
details, into sub-tasks,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.200
specifically to deal with each

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.740
of them.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.580


00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.340
The next pair of personal preferences are logic

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.940
and ethics, according to Jung’s typology.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.580
What is the logic, what is the logic?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.980
Well, logic is guided

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.100
by the profitability

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.840
of any decisions, any

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.260
results, any projects.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.700
If we talk to our colleague

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.600
of the logical type or to a competitor

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.540
or to a partner, we explain

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.300
to him that this is a project,

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.480
we start at that time, such

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.000
a time is required.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.180
The profit of it is this:

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.040
we invest so much, we get so much.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.840
We invest money like that, let’

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.060
s say, and we get money like that as

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.720
a result of the delta.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.060
Our costs are like that.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.740
So much work, so much

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.120
time is needed.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.580
And he simply thinks that it is beneficial

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.380
or not beneficial, depending on

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.040
this he decides whether they need

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.660
it or not.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.420
Will we do it or not?

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:55.900
Everything clear and understandable.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.020
If we tell him something else, such

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.940
as ethics, say, how it will affect

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.580
the climate in the team, who will

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.000
approve of it and who will not approve,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.620
it is not so important for

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.360
him.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.060
Approves, does not approve, he

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.140
came to work, he gets a salary

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.400
for this, that is all logical.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.920
For this salary, he needs results.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.320
The greater the result, the more

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.320
actively he will support such

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:20.920
a project.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.740
Ethical people are, of course, not

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.900
so focused on profit for the

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.720
company, they are more focused

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.280
on the climate, on the relationships

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.760
of people.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.240
They think so, but how will it happen?

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.180
Do we make a decision, how will

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.320
others look at it?

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.700
Who will it affect?

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.700
Will this decision be better for everyone?

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.200
And how do these consequences affect

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.420
each participant?

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.700
Actually, this is an example

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.540
that can be brought here for alloyists,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.220
ethics, we will try to solve

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.200
the problem a little later.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.620
That is, an example of such a person,

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.480
someone somewhere decided to go

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.360
outside the city, a normal ordinary

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.960
person, not yet top position,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.440
not even a middle manager, an

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.660
ordinary manager, who still

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.020
uses inter-city buses, took

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.620
a ticket for two weeks in advance,

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.880
goes somewhere to ski, sits

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.380
down to his third place

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.800
quietly to drive.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.540
And here the situation comes in, to

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.440
the driver comes up once prepares

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.140
the son there or grandfather I need

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.320
to go there take there money gives

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.220
him well and honestly when passing

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.400
sit there and the way we three hours

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.780
how much grandmothers we or grandparents

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.720
we do not know and here we go grandmother

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.520
is around us what to do to

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.800
give up the place or not give

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.800
up of course give up and why we

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.520
took the ticket in two weeks

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.560
we thought, respectively

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.220
we were preparing to drive us

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.340
long we paid out for what is called

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.320
the advance payment of this

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.880
ticket, grandmother came here,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.880
she realizes that she can not plan

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.820
her life, went to the grandchildren,

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.120
she did not see literally

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.620
since last September, very

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.720
cleaned.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.480
It’s her problem that she didn’

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.800
t take another bus on the very

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.620
thing, and we, actually speaking,

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.560
will give her place for

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.260
some reason.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.080
The train is standing and driving, once

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.780
it cannot think, can’t plan or does

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.440
not want to wait, the next bus

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.720
is going in two hours.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.740
Logical and logical.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.580
On the other hand, it is a pity

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.160
how you can take and just sit,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.420
and next to it is an old woman.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.640
Literally, maybe my mom and mom.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.800
And I sit, young, healthy, skiing,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.200
skiers there up there

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.460
in the trunk.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.040
Well, you can get up, stand up, after

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.100
all, at work, in the office we

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.100
sit for eight hours.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.760
It is even better to stand.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.040
Well, I say, it is more useful to stand – it

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.940
is logic again.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.300
If we talk about ethics, well, people

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.580
look around chicks, my grandmother.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.220
There is a woman with a child,

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.280
there is another grandmother next to her.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.540
Only I can give up my place.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.700
The ethic will sit and feel uncomfortable

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.840
under the disapproving views of

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.520
others, and of course he will give

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.060
up his place and stand as long as

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.040
he has to be a grandmother to her.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.380
And if she follows another grandmother,

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.080
she will still stand.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.960
He will give up the place of another because

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.960
he is ethical, because he is uncomfortable

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.360
sitting when a man is older than him, a

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.920
woman standing.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.220
But on the other hand, the logic

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.900
can be to give up.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.980
only he has the way of reasoning another

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.940
and that I sit in the office at 8 a.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.160
m. every day the cess will come there

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.800
again we will be in the restaurant

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.880
means to sit there to mark the arrival

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.160
of all dinner there and then only

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.240
tomorrow ski while then I stand someday

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.500
at 2 3 there look when grandmother

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.420
will go out may day there then I

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.340
sit normal legs to stand there

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.180
well what I will stand that is

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.920
they can come and the other and logic

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.720
to this same decision but the

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.160
way of making decisions will be

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.300
different If we know this way, knowing

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.420
the type of person, we can bring

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:53.860
him to the right choice we want.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.300
Do you understand why we need to choose?

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.500
We will not talk about it now.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.420
And the advantage of choosing or

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.160
something else will simply be that we

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.580
can influence the way.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.400
And again, when we assemble

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.940
a group to make a creative and heuristic

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.920
decision in a collegial

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.140
way, in a collegial

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.280
way, again, we need to choose to

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.440
be people of both logical and

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.340
ethical type, so that we consider

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.740
all the features, the

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.380
whole way of making that

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.240
decision.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.180
Okay, I understand.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:27.880
We went further.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.780
There is another fourth pair of personal

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.660
preferences, which are called decisive

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.520
and perceiving by the jungle.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.020
How is the decision being made here?

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.680
Let’s start with the simplest, the most sensitive.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.060
What are the features if

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.440
we include them in the decision-

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.240
making group?

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.180
The characteristic of those who perceive

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.500
is that they do not make decisions.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.740
In principle, never ever.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.300
at all.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.340
They just accumulate information

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.700
that they can share, discuss,

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.200
but never make decisions.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.700
No, they can accept it, say

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.660
“yes, this is what we are

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.680
doing,” and in two minutes say

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.660
“no, we will not do it.”

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.060
Therefore, if we negotiate,

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.280
some decision is made with competitors,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.460
partners, and in front

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.720
of us is a face of the

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.420
perceptive type.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.940
Once he has agreed to the decision,

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.640
you need to give him a paper

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.220
to sign so that he immediately signs.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.400
Otherwise, he may change his decision later.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.000
Then there will be new information, and

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.960
he will have another solution.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.900
It was little that he agreed.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.540
Two days later, he said, new

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.600
information came to him, and we

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.580
changed circumstances.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.300
Sorry, it is not beneficial for us now.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.420
Of course, he can then say that it

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.520
is not profitable for us when the

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.460
contract is signed, he may have

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.880
changed his mind, but in general,

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.100
the working company, if the contracts

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.680
are profitable in general,

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680
will still not work.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.700
As for the person of the decisive type,

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.940
they are just making the decision.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.920
Only they decide and decide.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.620
They take the decision seriously and for a long time.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.320
If a person of the decisive type has made

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.220
a decision, it is very difficult for Somebody

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.860
to change it.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.180
Including him himself.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.840
If we have achieved some

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.540
results in negotiations with a

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.440
partner, a competitor, someone

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.600
else, and worse still,

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.800
we have not achieved results,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.660
and he said, “No, we are

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.360
not happy,” then it is better

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.240
to stop negotiations right

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.220
now and not put any pressure,

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.380
not try, not waste time,

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.680
not waste any resources.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.100
He says, “All is well, thank you

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.640
for giving us time, let us break

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.780
up for a while, think, look

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.420
together, maybe something will

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.080
change in the situation and

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.940
meet again, and get him to just

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.100
agree that he will decide

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.500
to meet again, so that he is

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.740
in principle beneficial

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.540
to meet again.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.640
Once he makes this decision,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.760
you can break up, because

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.160
he will still sooner or

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.760
later agree to meet us.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.220
And by this point we will need to prepare

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.180
a solution for him, prepare a

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:00.960
draft solution for him, choose to prepare,

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.040
taking into account its parameters

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.220
such as logic, ethics, sensory and intuitive.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.580
If we lead the solution to the solution

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.980
we need in the right way, that decision

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.860
will be approved on that side

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.000
sooner or later.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.980
If he accepts it, then he will in principle

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.380
stand on that decision.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.920
No need to rush, immediately

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.560
sign all the papers on the

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.060
table.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.560
On the other hand, decisions

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.700
on cooperation between two

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.820
different organizations,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.220
i.e. management decisions that

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.760
some individuals make, they can

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.680
only be made if this cooperation

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.800
is beneficial to both

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.880
organizations.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.160
Another thing is that the

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.000
decision-makers depend on the pace

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.120
of convergence of positions, the pace

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.060
with which they meet each other,

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.420
conclude contracts and begin

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.680
an exchange of resources,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.400
say, goods, services, money resources,

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.920
information, and so on.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.040
If it is not beneficial for companies,

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.040
in principle, we can bring

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.460
down a decisive or perceptive

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.780
decision, conclude a contract,

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.500
in principle, break some

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.660
kind of cush.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.680
But later, as in the joke about

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.920
silver spoon, he will have

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.260
a sediment that the contract

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.460
was wrong.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:17.560
And yet, we will have to wait for

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.600
conditions where cooperation will

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.580
be mutually beneficial.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.880
We talked about this, we considered

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.880
how people make decisions

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.600
according to logic.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.340
It is, of course, all good that

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.600
this type of guy makes a decision

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.580
in such a way that to get some

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.960
solution from him we need,

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.540
we must provide him with information

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.560
in such a way.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.920
It is all good and great.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.820
The question is another.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.740
How do I know what type is this?

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.020
How do we gather the group

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.700
and so on the types we need?

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.720
First of all, when it comes to

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.020
the employees of your organization,

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.220
your colleagues, then nothing is easier.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.200
There are many different

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.120
variants of psychosocial type

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.640
tests and it is possible that

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.480
the HR service can test all

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.860
the employees of the organization,

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.320
at least those who lead

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.260
and make decisions.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.200
That is, we already know the type of

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.200
person, form groups of these people,

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.000
we know people, approach them with

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.760
a solution to the question, and it

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.940
is clear that he, knowing our

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.660
type, in some situation will

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.560
respond to us with mutuality or not,

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.200
depending on his interests, and so on.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.100
Again, let us note that

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.960
organizations usually

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.520
lack resources, especially

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.860
money.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.740
And it is clear that because of them there

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.700
are constant contradictions, including

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.060
those contradictions that give impetus

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.560
to the development of the organization.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.380
Now, how do we identify a

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.780
psychotype of a person we do not know?

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.160
First of all, of the remaining three pairs,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.920
preferences, with the exception

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.800
of the extrovert and the introvert,

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.660
the most important pair are the

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.520
decisive and the perceiving.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.000
That is, a person makes decisions in principle

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.480
or he does not take them in principle,

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.100
if he accepts, he immediately

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.880
changes.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.820
This is the main couple.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.940
Here you can find out, let’s say, not in

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.800
the form of the person himself.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.260
Let us imagine the situation, let us consider.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.440
Here is the sales department manager.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.540
His partner comes to another company.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.560
The same as the head of the department, well,

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.320
let’s say, the purchase.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.960
They have discussed a matter

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.240
and demand that we go to his

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.960
boss, to his boss, whom we have

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.160
never seen in the eye.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.480
We ask there in the conversation between the

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.380
affairs, it is clear that when people have

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.600
known for a long time or even recently,

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.140
there are tea, coffee and drink there

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.560
in the office.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:41.540
And we ask, how you have the boss in

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.200
general, he is a man of words, there is no word.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.240
And we ask two or three questions that

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.660
allow us to judge by the answers,

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.080
how much he relates to the decisive

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.520
type or to the perceiving,

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.360
how much he has been on the rise,

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.920
how quickly he makes decisions,

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.140
to give up his words or not,

00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:00.080
yes, that is, we can find out.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.820
It is further understood that we

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.640
cannot test our competitor

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.140
or partner by a paper test

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.920
or electronic test, especially a

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.680
high-ranking one, but we can try

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.340
to determine his type, yes, by his

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.960
behavior, let’s say, at some

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.620
parties in his form, yes, at general

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.820
industry holidays, which

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.960
are held, at some fairs, exhibitions,

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.820
seeing, listening to what he

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.220
says, how much he says, how

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.820
much he says, how much we

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.240
do, or, let’s say, we need to

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.960
think about this, we need

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.620
to think a little, we need

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.800
to consult how independent he is.

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.780
Because the person deciding,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.260
will say, yes, I will do it, yes,

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:43.620
I will.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.780
It will see, it will say, it will

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.440
think, it will see, there and so on.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.660
So focus on that.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.280
Then, if we have a list in the company,

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.800
that is, the characteristics

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.740
of each person, and we constantly

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.860
communicate with them, we get

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.660
used to the fact that a certain type

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.120
is behaved in a certain way.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.780
We will not now talk about the fact

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.280
that, in principle, all these four

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.380
pairs of preferences give

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.680
16 psychosociotypes, each of

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.180
which and in the internal

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.860
content corresponds with the appearance.

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.720
And, in principle,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.660
people of the same type are similar to

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.140
each other in basic features.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.880
Of course, one can say that type is a

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.620
non-permanent system of Jung, it is a

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.980
system of personal preferences.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.360
Indeed, people are not always the same.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.520
It changes depending on the

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.700
situation, the mood, the

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.920
time of year, how he woke up.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.780
It is clear that a person who

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.160
leaves his boss after a break

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.700
will make a different

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.460
decision than when he leaves the

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.880
boss when he was praised

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.240
and promised to give a premium

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.140
at the end of the quarter.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.380
Obviously different.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:53.940
But nevertheless, just as everyone has

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.860
a right hand and a left hand, and

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.620
the right hand prefers to do everything

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:00.960
with the right hand, to write, yes,

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.400
and the left hand with the left hand,

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.580
so the person, having each

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.560
pair of preferences, prefers

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.960
to use in most cases one preference

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.420
from the pair.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.480
Therefore, by communicating with

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.380
your colleagues, knowing their

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.040
type, we will learn to determine

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.100
how other people behave, and approximately

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:24.160
imagine that he is of himself...

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.340
how he will behave.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.600
Now, it’s no secret,

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:34.120
of course, as a rule, about

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.360
70% of women are ethical.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.700
And, accordingly, 70% of men to the logical.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.420
That is, if we go to the office to the

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.600
boss, we know that he is a man, we

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.400
don’t have time for his express

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.500
diagnosis, which we haven’t learned

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.060
to learn, and we are already on training,

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.660
we assume that in 70 cases out

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.000
of 100 he is a logic.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.500
And, accordingly, we are already building

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.140
a conversation based on logical qualities.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.960
On the other hand, we don’t know who he is,

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.240
but we were wrong, he wasn’t logical,

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.220
as it turned out.

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.480
So, you need to prepare the options of the

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.000
conversation in advance and on the second line,

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.640
on the line of ethics, to lead to the decision

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.980
on the line of ethics.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.960
Or the sensor is intuitive, meaning

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.200
we need to know the prospects of

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.320
some project, and the details, if we

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.520
are professionals, we know them,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:19.980
of course.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.460
And here we enter the man, we

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.840
talk to him, he begins to ask us questions

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.320
about the little things.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.080
So this how?

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.460
If you get to wrap up here, you’re going to wrap

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.060
up here, right?

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.260
How does it work?

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.920
How much guarantee do you have?

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.300
We make the preliminary conclusion that

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.520
we are dealing with the sensory

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.120
type now, and accordingly

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.700
we respond to it in its language,

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.320
in its sensory language.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.980
If he begins to ask, but how this project

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.560
will come out in the future, and how

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.740
we will participate in such a

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.280
thing, that is, these are questions

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.020
of a forward-looking plan.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.560
Accordingly, we can make the preliminary

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.880
conclusion that the person is currently

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.160
able, prefers to communicate

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.180
in the language of the intuitive

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.620
type, and we support this

00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.780
conversation.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.260
Of course, we remain our own

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.020
type, we need to know our type.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.560
We must control ourselves because it

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.780
is easier for us to speak in our own language,

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:13.300
and try to transition to the language

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.440
of our interlocutor so that

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.260
the decision made by him meets our

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.580
expectations to lead him to such

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.360
a decision.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.570
So the first.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.310
In your company, you can

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:30.390
centrally test all the necessary

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:31.730
management employees and know

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.010
their types both for gathering

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:35.710
groups and for working with

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.150
each individual, knowing their

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:38.750
strengths and weaknesses.

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.930
Second, to train those employees

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:45.710
who are involved in negotiations outside

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:47.130
the company, copper express

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.250
diagnostics, definition of type

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.210
of manager.

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:52.130
In fact, on the one hand,

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:53.110
it is difficult to do.

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.470
I only had one case when I hit

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:56.290
100%, immediately determined

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.610
the type of person.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.690
But, nevertheless, in the process

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:03.470
of conversation this can be done,

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.590
and in fact somewhere within a

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:08.770
minute you can determine what is

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.510
decisive or perceptive, extrovert

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.830
or not, sensory or intuitive

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:15.070
and logical or ethical.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.810
We do not need more.

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.870
If a person speaks a lot, let him talk,

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:18.990
let him talk, it will be easier for

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.770
us to determine if he is extroverted,

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:21.790
it will be easier to determine

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:22.750
what type he is.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:24.390
With an introvert it is a little more difficult,

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:25.570
they have to ask questions, and they don’

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:26.370
t like it.

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:27.970
That is, you can, again, as

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:30.390
we try to ask his colleagues

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:31.630
what he is about, ask questions,

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:32.670
what he pays attention to

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:34.350
when discussing projects,

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:35.910
what he likes more, whether he

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:37.250
is late when he starts

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:40.150
a meeting, or starts their

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.470
minute by minute – these are

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:45.810
just the properties of sensory

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:47.210
and intuitive.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.830
Sensory people always start everything

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:50.830
on time, they just don’t know what

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:52.770
a delay is, and intuitive people

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:54.950
can’t afford something, they

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.530
can just be late.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.050
If the intuitive guy

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:04.630
answers that come to me in

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.890
a few minutes, I will call

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.850
you, you will come to my

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:08.350
office.

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:10.870
These minutes can be both 55

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.670
minutes and 49.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:14.490
That is, the sensor will tell you clearly,

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.290
you come to me in 15 minutes, and it

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.510
will be ready to listen.

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:19.450
Intuitive is a little different.

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.550
That is, by time, you can determine

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:23.210
approximately, in relation to time,

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:24.370
what type of employees

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:29.690
are his colleagues, his subordinates,

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:31.870
persons working in the company

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.590
that communicate with him.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.170
And in ethics and logic we just

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.590
go, in the law of large numbers

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.150
we start, with the fact that men

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.370
are most likely logic, and women,

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.050
leaders are most likely ethics.

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.630
Only in our country is this difficulty.

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.810
If we work with a foreign company,

00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:51.690
there will be 95% of the 100%

00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:53.370
manager of the decisive type,

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:55.070
sensory and thinking.

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:59.010
Why exactly develop all foreign developed

00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:01.450
countries, that they have natural

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:04.350
selection put forward to the leading

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.370
positions of such persons, they are

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.050
easy to agree with each other.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.870
They spend the least time on them,

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.350
because they do business, and whoever

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.510
they will be affected is not

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:14.290
their concern.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:15.590
They need to make money, they are hired

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:18.150
for this, and they are paid for it.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:23.190
In fact, we are concerned with how we

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.410
behave within the walls of our own or

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.790
another organization when developing,

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.230
promoting and making decisions.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.090
Now there is another

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:35.230
psychological feature – it is when

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:37.950
a person is colloquified by the

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:39.630
“I-states” of Eric Burne.

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.290
They claim that there is a “I-

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.210
state parent”, “I-state adult”

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:45.990
and “I-state child”, or sometimes

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.370
called “child”.

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:50.170
You can talk a lot

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.730
with your parents.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.290
He usually evaluates the interlocutor,

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.530
evaluates the proposals,

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.630
he evaluates everything.

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:00.970
He likes to criticize the past,

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.590
to offend this past, as a rule,

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.650
the past is oriented.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.630
That is, if a person in a conversation

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.770
often uses verbs of past

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.330
time, most likely he is in the

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.670
state of "I am the parent",

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.610
and this state is unproductive.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.750
In this state, he will endlessly

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.010
pull the rubber, consider

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:22.810
questions, ask to think there,

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.490
he will not make a decision,

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:27.030
most likely.

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:28.930
Of course there are exceptions.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:33.190
The child’s life is directed to the future.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:35.550
He is energetic, he loves to play,

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.770
joke, smile, mark the future, tell

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:39.970
us how everything will be good

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.430
with us, and in his speech he often

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:44.590
uses the verb "in the future

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:45.790
of time".

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.110
The child’s condition is also not

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.430
productive, and also, as a rule, does

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.590
not make decisions.

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:52.910
He can offer various projects,

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.590
but with someone else dealing

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.670
with them.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.810
Only a person in clear state

01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:01.950
works and lives at the moment.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.490
He speaks about the matter, as a rule,

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.850
at the present time, and proposes

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.090
concrete actions.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.550
Here is our task – this is taught in

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.290
special training – in the course of

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.810
a conversation to translate the interlocutor

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.930
into the “I-state of adult”

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:22.890
and continue further contact

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.610
with him in order to make

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:25.470
a decision.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.450
What is good business games, how are

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.630
they different from meetings?

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.990
At the meeting, a person sits, he listens

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.890
to information and evaluates it.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.230
He has a “I-state” – the parent, in principle,

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:37.090
unconstructive for the decision-

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.490
making of action.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.690
In the game, a person performs

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.830
certain actions.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:46.250
He is already acting and therefore this

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:47.950
action and generates the decision

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:49.630
needed now and in the future that is,

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:51.590
he is in the clear state of adults

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.230
as a rule of the game translates a

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.130
person here is what their other plus

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:56.810
let us consider the example

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:01.990
first here purely for training how

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.110
to determine and try to go along

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:09.270
the way here is the foresight of

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.990
the decision which will take

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:15.550
the interlocutor yes First of all,

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.390
I want to note another subtlety.

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.190
There are training courses of managerial

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:24.410
empathy, when one person adjusts

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.650
to the state of another and tries

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:28.950
to predict what decision his

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.610
interlocutor will make.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:33.290
If we know how to do this and

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.210
feel that our interlocutor is

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:37.150
ready to make an unfavorable

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.710
decision, we should end the

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:44.430
contact, thank him and ask

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.340
to postpone the meeting for

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.600
later, or for an additional

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.800
meeting, empathy.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.080
Now we’ll look at an example

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.620
that lets us track the way

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.100
a person can make a decision

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.480
and what the outcome will

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.680
be, right?

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.660
Here is a simple task.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.180
We decide from the position of the

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.600
head of a simple department, someone very

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.120
responsible department, a small one.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.180
Here is what can be.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.420
The next subordinate approaches

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.200
us with a request to

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.040
grant a Friday break.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.400
The motivation is very sick grandmother

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.200
of his children who are in another

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.400
city.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.760
And besides, actually, bringing

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.760
grandchildren to her need to be there,

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.600
so that they are with her, will

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.420
be shaking, delighting her, grandmother

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.320
will move, somehow her

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.260
mood, well-being.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.920
The children go to the pharmacy and take care of them.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.360
That is, it is necessary.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.620
The employee must go there, take

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.400
the children.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.040
We have a weekend, a lot

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.820
of work.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.460
And, actually speaking, purely

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.820
humanly, as a manager, I was tired

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.660
of the endlessly questioning of

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.820
employees somewhere.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.980
What is called, this man was in

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.740
the divide.

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.620
He came to ask, well, we would let

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.780
him go in principle, and suddenly,

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.160
and something... And here we on Wednesday

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.280
have to make a decision – to

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.380
let him go or not to let go.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.600
Here, let’s consider two

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.140
options that our leader who makes

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.660
the decision is a logical

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.300
type of person.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.730
willing to refuse.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.260
What will he give

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.180
to his subordinate?

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.290
I think that will probably

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:35.970
be logical again, right?

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:38.950
He will tell you, and how to plan, and

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:41.450
how to, here is something there

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:42.490
needs to do your job.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:44.430
You just recently was, yes,

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.210
logically, only recently you

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.530
were on the go, now you need

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.590
to leave, but we need to perform

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:53.870
an urgent task, for which,

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.510
in fact, you get a salary.

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:57.490
Or maybe someone else will take them,

01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.010
the wife will take the children

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.130
there, or maybe they are already

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:02.750
grown enough to leave.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.210
“You just put them on the bus, call

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:05.690
their grandmother or someone, let

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:06.870
them meet.”

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:08.270
There are logical reasons to

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:09.570
refuse it.

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:15.310
Now, if we are leaders, type,

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:19.410
ethics, ethics type, let us

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.650
also refuse our interlocutor,

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:23.610
our subordinate, but we will

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:25.390
have others then.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.950
What formulas?

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.480
And the formulations can be such

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.740
that "how, today Wednesday, you put

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.040
me literally one day before the

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.800
shooting, I don't have time

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.240
to pick up someone, you put me in

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.180
a new position, I need to ask

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.800
someone, to persuade someone

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.200
to come from the place to work,

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.140
something was taken our order,

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.220
time is not much, I am very

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.560
difficult, you treat me as you

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.320
do not respect me at all,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.720
you would come on Monday,

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.940
I had time to persuade someone,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.440
and so I just feel uncomfortable,

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.580
I don't know how to

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.240
be.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.420
And, guys, you just came from the

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.280
outdoors, yes, and now you are

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:04.720
out again.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:05.960
What will the rest of

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.260
our department say?

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.440
They will say that you are my favorite,

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.480
I let you go endlessly, you have

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.400
some favors, and everything works.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.440
We refused him in both cases,

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.820
yes, but in one case we relied

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.720
on profitability and logic, in

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.500
another case on attitudes,

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.220
feelings and some ethical

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.340
parameters.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.780
We could also give the opportunity

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.120
to leave, being logical, or ethical.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.620
That is, we just looked at something

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.300
that the same decision can

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.300
be made by different people, only

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.140
different ways to it come,

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.460
approaches to it.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.280
And this once again emphasizes

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.380
the need and desire to be able

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.880
to do express diagnosis of our interlocutor

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.100
in order to get some

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.580
results from him.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.640
It is very difficult to test

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.280
your children's wife there and

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.680
so on, the parents of some other

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.780
relatives on these parameters

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.660
and calmly with them at least

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:08.180
to talk in their language in their

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.360
understandable language or there

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.080
is such a situation asks

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.120
even the boss of the employee

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.800
you why did not yesterday

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.960
at 17 a.m. that and that this

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.560
employee of the sensory type

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.500
yes He says, "Now I am already

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.400
overwhelming, I have done

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.640
almost everything."

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.620
And he is an employee of the intuitive

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.120
type, for him now it is this... “I will

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.440
bring you now, wait an hour, another, third.”

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.920
And he still carries now, because

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.220
for him now it is an extensive concept.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.640
He has no one minute, three, an

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.600
hour, and so on.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.700
This is necessary to know, respectively,

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.040
when taking control and implementing

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.800
some decisions, meaning that such

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.780
a person cannot keep track

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.220
of time, he simply cannot.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.260
And don’t give him control

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.700
points related to time.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.960
And you don’t have to expect that once

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.540
I told him to bring a finished result

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.180
at 17 a.m., some development,

01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.640
and he will bring them.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.080
No, you have to wait a little or

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.400
remind him a few times to this person,

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.080
or entrust it to someone else.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.540
Now another point related to the

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.620
formation of groups.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.340
As we have said, the optimum

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.240
from the point of view of

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.540
psychology is a group, when the

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.380
bosses have almost seven people.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:21.820
Why is?

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.380
Because the result of the

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.840
division is eight people and they

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.220
cover the entire range of social

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.080
roles of the mini-group.

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.600
If we go to a smaller number in the

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.320
unit, then one of the guys, from

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.120
the members of this group, has

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.980
to play two roles, or even three.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.140
And that makes him stressed, of course.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.260
That is, the decision on the formation

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:53.340
of such a division may not be optimal,

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.760
but acceptable, normal, but,

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.640
nevertheless, it will already be

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.580
acceptable in some way.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.200
A larger number, better from the position

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.860
that then one or two roles will be played

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.640
by different people, that is, some

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.520
role will be played by two or three

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.920
people, that is, some roles will

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.020
be duplicated, it is more reliable.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.580
But we simply overload our

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.520
leader, he and the head

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.740
of the unit, and he has more

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.900
wages, so that he carries

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.000
a bigger burden.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.640
Now, colleagues, if we look at the

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.600
course of decision making in general,

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.860
what have we looked at?

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.240
We have determined what is

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.960
a management decision time.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.060
That’s the result, some choice of

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:32.980
purpose, right?

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.900
This is a process and it is the result

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.960
of management work.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.040
Here, let us put another point,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.360
which is very important in the goal setting.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.880
When we choose the goal we need to,

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.640
there is such an opinion in the

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.880
literature, it is recommended

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.200
to put the goal as high as

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.120
possible.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.160
They say that the higher the target, the more

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.340
it is like a float, the more it has

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.600
a lifting force.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.780
It calls another achievement.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.340
But in practice, somewhere

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.740
it is recommended to set a goal or goal

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.100
for the division of the percentage

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.020
by 20 higher than the point that

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.760
you really need to.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.340
Then this new goal, which is higher

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.460
than the previous one, allows that previous

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.200
80 percent goal to be achieved easily

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.960
and easily, without stress.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.860
In psychology so is.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:32.720
This is once.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.820
The second is for the objectives.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.000
Strategic management

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.540
has four strategic

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.720
alternatives for the organization.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.960


01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.100
It is a strategy of growth, it is a strategy

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.540
of limited growth, it is a strategy of

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.660
reduction and it is considered a strategy of combination.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.580
If we look at them from the perspective

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.840
of management decisions, what are the differences

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.280
between a growth strategy and a limited

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.320
growth strategy?

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.320
Only in pace.

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.360
In fact, it is still a growth

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.200
strategy.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.380
And for the organization here you do not

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.360
need to choose a strategy for the management

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.200
of the company, because the growth rate of

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.120
the strategy is tightly tied to the

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.100
profile of action, to the profile of the

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.940
company, to the profile of the company's activity.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.780
If a company is engaged in high

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.480
technology, it is only

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.440
recommended to grow.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.500
If it is a resource company, there

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.260
is a coal mining company, then

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.200
limited growth.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.080
Of course yes?

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.380
There is nothing to choose here.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.400
When they say, it is necessary

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.600
to decide how to develop the company

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.340
further here to choose nothing there

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:39.480
is the company profile there is a growth

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.920
rate set if the growth rate is

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.000
not observed the competitor is ruined

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.480
all now the next strategy of reduction

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.740
so it is clear what it leads it

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.260
sooner or later in general if

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.660
not to make a benchmark on growth

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.300
will lead to the liquidation

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.340
of the company some combination

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.760
it is again of two strategies but

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:08.140
on Growth or Cut and closure, choose

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.160
not of anything, that is,

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.340
here no decisions should be

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.540
made.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.220
Just we, once there is a company, there

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.220
is a profile, we have arranged it,

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.340
let’s say we have made a career

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.300
to the top manager, to the first person,

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.740
to the distribution of credits,

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.980
the director-president or

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.540
chairman of this company, that is,

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.960
we know what we should do next

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.040
already.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.960
It comes from the profile only.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.940
Next to decision making.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.160
Under this very strategy of

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.000
the company development

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.760
there is a strictly linked personnel

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.580
strategy.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.140
There is no choice here either.

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.940
Although many teach, you will have

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.120
to choose a personnel strategy, there

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:48.960
are so many.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.780
No, in each development

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.480
strategy, there is

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.260
only one HR strategy,

01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.360
one HR strategy.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.020
And, accordingly, under this

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.380
personnel strategy, corporate

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.320
culture is already built, that is,

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:13.210
also to choose from nothing, talking

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:19.050
about major principled decisions.

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:22.770
And, in fact, if we talk about the

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.150
principles of large decisions,

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:27.230
then the solution, that is, the goal

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:28.930
of the company can be only one

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:32.650
- capture the leading positions

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:33.810
in the market.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:37.750
If the company does not have that goal,

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.450
they ask why it came to the market.

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.810
Sooner or later, competitors will get rid of it.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.880
So, colleagues, we have considered

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.440
in our short course the

01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.680
concept of management decision,

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.140
the decision-maker and that

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.280
decisions are right and

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.920
wrong, that decisions are

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.480
optimal, satisfactory.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.060
We considered the classification of

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.480
solutions according to different criteria,

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.460
different indicators, considered the way

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.580
of making decisions from the stage of

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.580
the problem through the limitation

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.520
of criteria, through the development

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.060
of alternatives, through the choice of

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.000
some alternative and the implementation

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.440
of this project with feedback.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.500
We then looked at how

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.720
decisions are made in different

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.340
models, allowing us to choose

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.440
the model we like most

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.360
in our organization or move

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.640
to that organization for our

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.000
own career.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.560
We then looked at what is done with

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.900
resources, how to use the resources

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.900
of the organization, how to make strong

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.700
management decisions that either

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.040
do not require resources or work

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.880
in the absence of resources.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.920
After that, we looked at decision-

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.120
making techniques for first-line

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.200
managers and mentioned that there

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.440
are mathematical decision-

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.620
making techniques and an entire

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.380
machine that can be used.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.600
And more or less in detail, as far

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.120
as possible, considered

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.380
euclidean or creative methods

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.940
of decision-making as a

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.480
tool for the organization’s work.

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.300
Furthermore, we looked at how

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.160
different types of people behave

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.600
when making decisions, decided that

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.620
our decisions will now be only

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.940
correct and that in order to choose

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.300
some option you need to consider

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.340
not only instant resource

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.380
support but also the consequences

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.220
of both close and remote we decided

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.300
the main in our course on which

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.160
to choose the course of development

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.280
of the organization which to

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.600
choose the direction of development

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.000
of the organization as it is

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.920
chosen that is without

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.020
the choice how to attach the

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.240
personnel strategy to it and,

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.640
in fact, the main goal of any

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.900
organization is leading position

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.780
markets.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.000
Thanks for attention.
