WEBVTT

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.360
With Russia's accession to the WTO and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.920
the entry of foreign companies into

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.500
the Russian market, the problem

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.380
of business security is moving to

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.700
a fundamentally new level.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.640
For successful competitive struggle,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.180
Russian companies will need to introduce

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.900
new security technologies

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.260
for business.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.720
The theme of the seminar

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.300
is the security of business activities.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.760
Today we will discuss the following topics.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.580
Entrepreneurship and competitive

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.800
struggle.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.280
Business security,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.320
security threats.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.500
We will pay special attention

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.920
to the information and analytical

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.640
security of the business.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.340
We will also talk about personnel

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.480
security, counteracting corporate

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.140
seizures, counteracting

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.320
economic terrorism and in conclusion

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.860
we will talk about the

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.540
organization of business

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.460
protection.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.460
So, let's get to the first topic

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.840
of our class.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.760
Entrepreneurship and competitive

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.100
struggle.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.740
Let's see what entrepreneurship is.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.320
If you consider entrepreneurship

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.640
as a cycle consisting of a plan,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.560
the plan is implemented into

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.800
business processes and the goal

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.840
of any entrepreneurship

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
is to make a profit.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.860
It is the earning of profit that distinguishes

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.580
entrepreneurial activities from

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.380
the activities of state structures,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.860
where the main task is

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.540
to perform the task.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.120
There are various

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.120
threats to business.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.180


00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.260
Threats can be very different.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.700
Starting from threats from

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.240
the criminal, from competitors,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.260
from the state, even by

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.920
issuing laws that are

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.680
not always convenient for

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.280
the entrepreneur.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.840
Threats are also internal, especially

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.680
threats from their employees.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.340
We will talk more about

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.180
the threats later.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.900
The law on competition and restriction

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.140
of monopolistic activity

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.560
in the commodity

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.120
market.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.720
What does this law say?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.500
What do we understand by competition?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.380
Competition is understood as competitiveness.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.940
Competitiveness of economic entities,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.400
when their independent

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.700
actions effectively limit

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.080
the ability of each of

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.280
them to unilaterally affect

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.060
the general condition of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.100
circulation of goods on the relevant

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.120
commodity market.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.720
This definition is given on the slide.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.580
Competition is a prerequisite

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.240
for normal market relations.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.200
In this case, we will pay

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.480
more attention to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.280
unfair competition.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.640
That is, competition,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.960
unfair competition is a very important

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.080
moment in the life of any entrepreneur,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.180
and it is the protection from

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.440
unfair competition that often lies

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.840
at the basis of the successful

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.260
activity of the entrepreneur.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.940
So, the slide shows the relations

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.680
between market participants

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.400
in the market economy.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.700
In these conditions, the entrepreneur

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.020
and his company may be in different

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.800
conditions with market participants.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.600
It can be cooperation, or interaction,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.800
or competition,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.300
or competition.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.640
The highest level of competition

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.320
is the fight.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.000
The main tool for determining

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.280
market relationships and the main

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.920
tool for analyzing competitive

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.020
environment is the Michael Porter

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.140
Five-Force Model.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.460
In the slide it is presented as the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.340
following picture.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.380
The outstanding American scientist

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.240
Michael Porter, the founder of the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.820
doctrine of competition,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.320
he proposed the model of the five

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.440
forces of Michael Porter, but for

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.220
the Russian in reality this model

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.780
transformed into a model of six

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.720
forces.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.360
And we will talk more in detail

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.560
about each of these forces that

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.060
act on the activities of our company.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.500
The first force is the competitor of the company.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.600
The second force that determines the

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.140
company's competitive position is raw

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.320
materials.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.640
Raw materials are the supply of raw materials

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.400
components, is a very important condition

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.260
for the successful operation of the company.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.160
The next buyer.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.300
Buyer lists or customer lists always

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.580
constitute a business

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.500
secret of the enterprise, and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.760
if competitors try to get and

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.620
get these lists, they will get,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.880
they will have a competitive

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.700
advantage.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.220
The fourth force is the power of the goods-replacement.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.900
The appearance of an unexpected

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.160
new product on the market, which in

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.320
its characteristics, in its

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.320
purchasing properties,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.120
is superior to the product you produce,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.220
and if this appearance is unexpected,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.540
it can lead to the fact that

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.740
your company will go bankrupt.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.360
An example is mobile phones.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.540
When the pager companies began

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.960
to conquer this market, mobile phones

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.480
were not very developed, and companies

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.700
did not override, I speak

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.360
of pager companies, did not override

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.520
the possibility of

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.360
rapid market capture by new

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.900
manufacturers.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.240
What happened?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.500
The possibility of new products

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.760
replacement poses a

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.560
great threat to the company.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.540
The fifth force is the potential

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.460
competitor.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.320
The possibility of appearing

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.160
in a competitive environment of

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.040
companies that have not previously engaged

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.400
in this business, but have large

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.280
resources, financial resources,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.500
administrative resources, and

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.620
which suddenly enter this market,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.040
these companies can significantly

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.940
change the balance, the

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.080
balance of competitive,

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.000
which has been developed to the

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.900
present moment.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.840
Well, let's say, what a large

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.320
company like Gazprom goes into the

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.580
media market or the educational

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.220
services market, and having, in general,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.720
the most powerful resources, it becomes,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.920
of course, a very serious competitor

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.640
for your company, if you

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.760
are engaged in this business.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.200
And for Russia.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.440
For Russia, the sixth power or power

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.760
of administrative resource

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.320
is very important.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.800
Under administrative resource we

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.220
understand the possibilities

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.220
of non-economic competition,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.980
namely the ability

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.440
of administrative authorities

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.860
to influence the competitive space.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.460
The phone right, in general, no

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.140
one has canceled yet.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.140
The administrative resource also

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.580
includes the media, which

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.680
can create a negative image of

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.720
your company, which will also

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.880
affect the distribution

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.600
of forces in the competitive space.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.620
The court also includes crime.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.880
Organized crime can very

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.060
actively affect competitive

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.580
struggle.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.540
Therefore, in the study and analysis

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.880
of the competitive environment,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.440
we use this model widely, which

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.240
becomes one of the main

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.780
elements, one of the main

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.140
tools of analysis.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.560
Now let's look at the methodology of detection

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.900
of threats based on the use

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.140
of the 5 forces model of Michael Porter.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.200
At the beginning, we identify competitors.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.380
Competitors can be not only in

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.000
commodity markets and services markets,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.980
but competitors can be in the field

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.060
of finance, real estate,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.220
in the field of personnel.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.920
Now there is very much competition,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.500
especially in Moscow, when

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.340
there is a struggle for territory,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.080
that is, competition is accompanied

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.060
by various kinds of corporate seizures,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.960
unfriendly acquisitions, and

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.240
often this competition is

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.300
conducted from beyond the land

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.980
on which the enterprise is

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.760
located, even a successful

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.040
enterprise.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.040
Second, after we have identified

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.000
competitors, we have identified the

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.460
legal frequency of our contacts.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.880
It is very important to correctly

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.100
issue documents for privatization,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.420
for the right to own real estate,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.860
for rental, because it is

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.920
with errors in contracts that corporate

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.100
seizure begins, when the company-

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.380
aggressor seeks for weak spots

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.840
in the legal frequency of

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.940
your documents, after which

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.760
legal processes begin.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.660
Next, the third part of this methodology

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.940
is to consider the impact of each force,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.260
we remember the six forces, and

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.420
we consider the impact of each force on

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.800
the sustainability of our business.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.860
Furthermore, we study the structure

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.960
of the administrative resource and

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.680
evaluate possible reactions to your

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.400
actions of competitors, to the actions

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.660
of the administration.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.620
And the last thing we do when working

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.080
with this technique is to monitor

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.960
to detect the possibility

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.960
of signs of threats, as well as

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.180
the appearance of new products

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.680
and products - replacement.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.940
That is, these are the issues that the

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.100
information and analytical structures

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.920
of your security service are starting

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.120
to deal with.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.060
The last is to identify

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.020
potential competitors.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.920
This is how we conduct the first analysis,

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.620
the analysis of the situation.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.580
This analysis is necessary

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.240
to create a security model

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.980
for your company.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
Unfair competition.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.440
A few words about the main forms

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.040
of unfair competition.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.760
We can identify three directions.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.100
The first is economic repression,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.540
the second is physical repression,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.820
and we have classified industrial

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.640
espionage as a separate

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.200
category of unfair

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.420
competition.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.720
In the case of unfair competition,

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.420
competitive struggle is conducted

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.060
by methods associated with

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.600
violation of market norms and

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.560
rules.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.740
What are these violations?

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.100
First of all, it is the receipt of

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.880
tax and other benefits.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.040
Getting tax and other benefits is

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.780
corruption, it is theft, confidential

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.280
information, we just talked

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.200
about industrial espionage,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.340
it is disinformation.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.260
Desinformation is also often used

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.020
very much in competitive struggle.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.580
Use of criminal methods of combat,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.560
work through underwriting firms,

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.820
having various benefits.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.600
Let us go to economic repression.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.820
What is it?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.120
What methods do unfair

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.080
competitors use in the

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.740
struggle for competitive advantage?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.120
Termination of deals and other agreements.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.760
Termination of the activity

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.460
of the competitor using administrative

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.880
resources.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.940
We are witnesses to many cases

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.220
where successful companies were

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.080
under the press of various,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.000
so-called, turns in

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.380
the pursuit.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.040
This is also the sanitary stations

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.320
that carry out checks daily.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.760
They are firefighters.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.460
In Russia, there are more than 50

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.180
federal bodies with the right to

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.000
control and supervision.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.620
Unfortunately, these bodies do

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.580
not always act in accordance with the law.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.880
Further, economic suppression is the undermining

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.620
of the competitor's reputation.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.600
The Black Pier.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.860
Creating a negative image of the

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.520
company or the head of the company

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.980
in the eyes of the public

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.100
and in the eyes of the buyers.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.760
This is the disorganisation of the production

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.020
of competitors, the overwhelming of leading specialists.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.500
The arsenal of economic repression is

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.560
very large.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.220
The Industrial Spy.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.000
The second major area

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.160
of unfair competition is industrial

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.280
espionage.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.160
Defining industrial espionage.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.360
This means that it is illegal secret

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.560
or force-seizure of information

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.140
that the competitor's leadership

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.600
would like to hide from outsiders.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.920
Industrial espionage is

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.100
the use of prohibited methods

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.580
of information erasure.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.280
It is the listening to phones,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.520
the introduction of radio devices.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.860
Theft of documents.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.100
This is not authorized access to

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.420
computer information.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.200
This is the bribery of competitors, the purpose

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.400
of obtaining the necessary information.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.500
Industrial espionage has been

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.500
developed for a long time.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.440
With the emergence of new competitors

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.520
from Western countries on the Russian

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.620
market, I think we will face a lot of

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.240
experience in the application of industrial

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.900
espionage techniques, since in the West

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.060
industrial espionage, as a phenomenon,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.940
has existed for a long time.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.500
In the United States, industrial

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.180
espionage is ranked second

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.000
as a threat after terrorism.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.680
And in the West there are very

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.840
strict laws against industrial spies,

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.140
which, unfortunately, in Russia

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.920
is not yet.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.200
Thus, the objects of industrial

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.780
espionage are information, samples

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.500
of products, technology, industrial

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.080
waste, and recipe.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.900
A few words about what is,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.000
what information is interesting

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.700
for industrial spies.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.480
This information constitutes a

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.640
commercial secret.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.840
In Russia, in 2004, a law on commercial

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.960
secrets was issued, which

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.320
regulates activities

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.760
in this field.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.380
Two words about what a trade

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.600
secret is.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.340
A commercial secret can be defined

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.120
as scientific, technical, technological,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.540
production, financial, economic

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.660
or other information, including

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.420
the constituent secrets

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.600
of production or know-

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.900
how.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.900
Know-how translates as “I know how.”

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.620
And here the information that

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.520
has actual or potential value

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.980
is the first condition.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.120
Second, this information is not

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.540
free access to third parties

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.460
on a legal basis.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.240
The third is that the owner or owner

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.640
of this information has introduced

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.240
a trade secret regime in relation

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.480
to such information.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.900
One can give an example of how it is

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.660
necessary to keep their secrets, so when

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.100
visiting one aircraft plant

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.660
in the United States of America, it

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.700
is the Boeing plant, the Japanese delegation

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.420
was dressed, it was hot and the

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:24.160
Japanese were dressed in short

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.740
shorts, in light shirts, but on

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.400
their feet they had shoes on

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.320
a large microporous pillow.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.140
When the Boeing security service

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.180
analyzed the activities of this

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.660
excursion, they concluded that

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.140
the Japanese specially wore

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.380
microporous shoes to make metal

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.960
slurries from alloys used in aircraft

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.500
construction, these

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.300
slurries fit into the pillow

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.060
and thus the Japanese took

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.860
out of the territory of

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.500
the plant industrial waste,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.020
the content of which

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.960
was a commercial secret.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.900
Boeing filed a lawsuit against the

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.600
Japanese company, but the US court found

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.880
the actions of the Japanese company

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.900
legitimate, because Boeing did

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.680
not take measures to close,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.980
to ensure the regime of commercial

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.600
secret, that is, no measures

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.500
were taken to preserve

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.280
this secret.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.140
What are the information leakage channels?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.620
Here on the slide are the channels

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.060
of information leakage, well two main

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.220
channels, it is leakage through personnel

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.080
and leakage through technical

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.120
channels, natural and artificial

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.820
channels.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.760
Physical repression.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.180
Physical repression is

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.840
also a very important element

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.560
of unfair competition.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.760
Well, this is robbery, attacks

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.580
on offices, on staff, threats

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.340
of physical executions

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.120
on heads and family members,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.380
ordered murders, hostage capture.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.240
Now we are facing a new phenomenon

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.940
of unfair competition, this

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.820
is economic terrorism, that is,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.720
the methods of economic terrorism

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.380
are beginning to penetrate into

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.480
industry, this is explosions, this

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.560
is the use of chemical

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.900
and poisonous substances against

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.960
competitors.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.700
Unfortunately, this is the reality.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.580
Unfair competition can also be

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.620
attributed to fraud, unfriendly

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.100
merger and acquisition,

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.180
black pear, head hunting,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.040
also interesting areas of

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.860
competitive struggle, unfair

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.900
competition, head hunting

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.180
or head hunting.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.920
Head -head, hunt -hunter - hunter

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.710
Work on ensuring the safety of business

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.310
activities in the conditions of

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.010
competitive struggle is the

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.070
activity to identify possible

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.170
competitive threats, prevent

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.330
and eliminate them, or

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.470
minimize them by means of appropriate

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.090
legal design of technological

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.430
implementations and

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.130
organizational measures.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.010
Protection against unfair competition

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.790
involves a number of methods.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.690
This is primarily organizational

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.350
methods, information methods,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.130
identifying various links

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.810
with crime and with administrative

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.590
resources.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.510
Use of various technical

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.210
means.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.190
The slide shows some areas

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.650
of activity to protect against

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.910
unfair competition.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.670
The existing information resource and

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.770
existing sufficiently successfully

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.410
cope with this task, well, of

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.330
course, in the presence

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.310
of trained personnel in this field.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.880
Now let us consider the second topic.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.280
Let's talk about safety principles.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.560
If in the first part we talked about

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.640
entrepreneurship, we talked about

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.800
the competitive environment, then

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.120
now we will talk more in detail

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.000
about what is security.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.080
In defending our case, we must

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.480
answer three questions.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.120
The first thing we are defending.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.080
The second question is who we are protecting.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.360
The third is how we protect

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.080
our business.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.180
And these three questions, they

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.220
define the structure, the concept

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.440
of security of any business, including

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.940
entrepreneurship.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.680
Defining the security.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.840
Security is the state of protection

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.560
of the vital interests of the

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.440
state, society, individual, enterprise

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.100
from external and internal

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.480
threats.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.840
This definition is defined

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.500
in the Russian Federation

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.320
Security Act.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.160
The concept of safety can be interpreted

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.100
more easily, as the Ozhikov dictionary

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.340
describes.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.160
Security is the absence of threat

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.820
to anyone, anything.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.400
A life without threats is

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.540
a safe life.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.980
Security is the impossibility of harming

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:21.280
the manifestation of threats, that

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.820
is, their protection from threats.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.620
The Maslow pyramid is found.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.400
It is a well-known pyramid that

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.980
shows the hierarchy of needs of

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.880
each person.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.820
The pyramid is based on

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.920
physiological needs.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.900
Food, housing, food, food, housing,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.300
clothing, heat and self-preservation needs.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.440
Security, as the need for self-

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.860
preservation, lies at the basis of

00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.600
the pyramid and any society, any

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.860
manifestation of human

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.660
activity is always associated

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.020
with the need to ensure security.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.960
Structure of the concept of security.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.600
The first question is, what

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.040
to protect?

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.680
It is a security object.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.680
In our case, the object

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.600
of security is business

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.520
activity, is our company, is the

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.600
management of companies, the

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.340
staff of companies, members

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.000
of their families.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.780
These are security objects.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.180
threats to the security object.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.120
We have already started to talk a little

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.360
about what threats are.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.260
The classification of threats is quite complex.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.740
Thus, threats can be external,

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.940
internal, threats can be accidental,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.220
threats can be deliberate,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.520
threats can be natural, and

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.420
threats can come from

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.080
technological processes.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.500
This is a lot being said now,

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:06.520
and this issue really deserves

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.740
attention.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.580
The third component structure of the

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.540
concept of security is to

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.200
ensure the security of the object.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.920
These are the resources and resources

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.860
that every entrepreneur should

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.860
direct to their safety.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.100
So, the security object is what protects,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.080
protects against threats.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.960
Well, in our case, as we said,

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.840
the security object is the entrepreneur,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.540
it is the business process,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.860
it is his activity.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.900
The security content of the security

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.720
system will be the protection against

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.780
threats of unlawful change of property,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.880
threats of damage to financial

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.820
and material resources of personnel,

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.440
threats of confidential

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.640
information.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.460
What are security objects?

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.740
These are the types of activities, this

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.880
is the property and resources of the enterprise,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.240
this is the staff, management.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.580
Now we are talking about shareholders,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.800
which are also an object of security.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.900
Let's see what

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.980
is business security.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.060
This is a set of activities

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.260
on security, means of security

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.860
and security entities.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.920
Let's start with the subjects.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.780
The security of business

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.340
is the one who protects

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.260
business.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.400
These are state structures, law

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.080
enforcement agencies, private

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:58.040
security enterprises, consulting

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.380
companies.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.600
And, of course, the first

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.320
subject of security is the

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.540
company's own security

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.280
services.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.860
Moreover, a number of functions of

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.320
the enterprise's security service can, therefore,

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.080
be given aside, for example, by concluding

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.620
a contract with a private security

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.920
enterprise on the protection of

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.780
the external perimeter.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.740
Safety measures, what

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.800
measures?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.080
These are technical

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.160
means, perimeter

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.960
protection, access

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.900
control, computer

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.460
security.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.720
In general, in modern society,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.520
the industry of business security

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.560
is very developed, as evidenced

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.360
by the appearance of a sufficiently

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.240
large number of various

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.300
technical and software

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.420
tools on the market.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.000
Well, and security activities

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.760
are organizational measures,

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.760
they are management measures,

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.600
and legal measures to ensure

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.380
business safety.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.520
The picture shows the consequences of

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.140
the security violation.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.060
What could lead to a

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.600
security breach?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.360
First of all, it is a violation of the

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.660
business process.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.180
Violation of the business process

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.840
can lead to loss of revenue, may lead

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.220
to a reduction in investor confidence,

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.520
a reduction in customer confidence,

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.680
a deterioration of the company's

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.520
reputation, or a loss or

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.620
compromise of confidential

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.040
data held by the company.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.300
And, of course, there may be legal

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.280
consequences associated with either

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.500
the loss of the business as a whole,

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:08.380
or the loss of some business assets.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.410
Now let's look at the

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.530
third threat.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.190
We will discuss security

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.050
threats in more detail.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.350
What is a security threat?

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.250
First, let's define the

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.070
concept of threat.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.290
Threat is a set of factors and conditions

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.450
that pose a danger to the

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.810
vital interests of the

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.870
individual, society and the state.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.450
For an enterprise, the

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.030
definition of a security

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.330
threat will sound as

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.930
a set of factors and conditions

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.470
that pose a danger

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.330
to the vital interests

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.050
of the enterprise and

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.070
the vital interests of

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.890
business activity in general,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.230
the threat this intention

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.570
threat intent to harm

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.250
a potential threat quite

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.750
general such a concept

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.590
and we talk about the

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.730
threat as some kind

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.590
of a set of actions not

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.030
occurring when the threat

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.570
is not realized then

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.750
we talk about causing

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.590
damage or we talk about

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.410
the attack to ensure

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.150
the security of the

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.850
enterprise the most

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.110
important condition is

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.670
the identification

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.730
in the early stages of

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.390
the detection of

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.270
the early stages

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.690
of the appearance of

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.790
the threat minimization

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.010
of the damage from

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.370
these threats means

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.270
the basis of the business

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.690
organization is also

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.570
the analysis of the

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.810
real and potential

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.370
external and

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.030
internal threats,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.670
that is, we are

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.370
in the beginning

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.410
of the search for

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.050
possible threats

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.810
for the organization

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.730
of the

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.110
security

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:08.250
Since the situation changes quickly

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.090
enough, it is also the financial

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.710
situation, it is the demographic

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.210
situation, the political

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.330
situation, then every element, every

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.790
situation, it may one way or another

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.270
represent the ground for threats.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.090


00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.230
One important transition

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.550
to threat analysis is their

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.690
classification and ranking by

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.090
their nature and by the degree

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.870
of danger they pose.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.970
With this classification of threats,

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.050
different signs can be used, and

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.010
here the slide shows a comprehensive

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.430
classification of the security threats

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.230
of the company.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.790
Threats can be divided by

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.510
the source of origin, who

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.690
is the source of the threat,

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.990
whether it is a crime, whether

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.030
it is a competing organization,

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.810
whether it is a Western company.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.890
Furthermore, we can talk about the

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.030
nature of the threat, whether it

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.930
is a threat of a technogenic nature,

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.130
whether it is a natural catastrophe

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.970
or a threat related to human

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.310
activity, the threat can be intentional

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.730
and unintentional.

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.190
Threats can be divided by

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.070
probability of implementation,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:46.510
the threat can be very real and very unlikely.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.630
In the amount of expected damage,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.390
for example, the damage from

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.210
the implementation of a threat can

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.950
be very large, but the probability

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.130
of this threat and its implementation

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.530
can be very small.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.530
Threats can be divided

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.550
as predictable when

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.490
we can predict a threat

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.190
or not.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:14.410
The threat may occur by chance.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.650
For example, we can predict some

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.610
techno-genetic disasters, understanding

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.010
that the life of, for example,

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.590
some unit, 15-20 years has already

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:35.150
passed, but the unit still continues

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.250
to work, but the likelihood

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.470
of a threat, of course,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.670
increases sharply.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.850
According to the object of the attack,

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.190
there can also be a certain

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.810
classification, what the threat

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.110
is aimed at, what business process,

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:53.410
what person.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.810
By analyzing all the security threats of

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.970
the company, we can create a so-

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.470
called threat matrix that will show us

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.290
the possible threats, possible damage,

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:10.210
and by analyzing the threats and

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.750
sources of threats, we are able

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.190
to build a system, a model of

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.650
protection of our organization.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.850
Who could be the source of threat?

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.170
That is, threats we have seen what

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.810
it is, and now means sources

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.170
of threats.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.270
The slide shows the main sources

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.450
of threats.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.110
These are primarily competitors,

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.370
customers, crime, other

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.150
sources to which the state belongs.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.370
Yes, the state can also be a

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.770
source of threats to

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.090
the entrepreneur, by issuing some

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.450
law that will limit the action

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.010
of entrepreneurs, or by means

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.290
of licensing the state can

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.850
also limit the activity

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.550
of the enterprise.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.970
The state also uses

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.690
tax methods.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.270
The source of threats may be foreign

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.610
intelligence of TNCs, we are talking

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.150
about Russia's accession to TNCs, these

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.510
are transnational companies.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.410
Public organizations also

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.690
pose a threat to many,

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:33.410
such as environmentalists.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.550
Often under the mark of the

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.990
struggle for the environment

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.050
may be competitors, or competitors

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.990
can somehow influence public organizations,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.550
attracting them to

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.690
competitive struggle.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.070
Ex-employees, inadequate personalities,

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.390
especially former offended

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.650
employees who know the vulnerabilities

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.590
of your company and have good connections,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.510
remaining business connections,

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.430
are also a very dangerous

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.890
source of threat.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.150
External hazards and threats

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.610
arise outside the enterprise,

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.550
but, as a rule, these sources, these

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.410
dangers they interact with

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.530
internal sources of threats,

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.150
that is, external sources are

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.150
looking for an ally within

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.310
your enterprise.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.670
Here, on the slide, what external

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.170
dangers and threats arise

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.330
outside the enterprise and who

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.510
are these sources, almost everyone

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.310
has spoken about, but sect

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.710
and informal association

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.970
can also pose

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.790
a certain danger.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.990
So, the sources of internal threats are

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.810
personnel, that is, the staff is,

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.190
on the one hand, the object

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.410
of protection, since the personnel

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.790
is directed by the aspirations of

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.250
many of our intruders and competitors,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.510
but the staff is also

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.930
the source of internal threats.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.570
These are family members, these are shareholders,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.390
and the new source of internal threats

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.250
is the management.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.330
If we talk about internal competition,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.590
such a phenomenon has appeared

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.910
recently, when the struggle for the

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.970
redistribution of ownership

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.690
begins and often unfriendly absorption

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.090
and merger, they occur precisely

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.570
with the involvement of part of

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.570
the management of the enterprise,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.930
that is, between VIPs, between

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.170
the leading managers

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.870
of the enterprise can often

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:02.590
also be competitive struggle.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.690
Threats to the security of business here

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.910
are shown on the slide, internal threats

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.130
to them we include sabotage, information

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.630
leakage, theft, violation of

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.070
control, here is a very dangerous

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.150
threat, this is a violation of

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.950
the decision-making process

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.230
and bringing this decision to executives.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.070
This is a violation of the technological process.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.330
We have spoken a lot about external

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.450
threats, we include the manifestation

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.230
of economic terrorism, the

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.030
manifestation of industrial

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.790
espionage, theft of material and

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.910
financial funds, racket, extortion,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:43.290
blackmail, physical extortion,

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.430
intimidation, all the arsenal

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.910
of threats is very - very great.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.540
Depending on the type of threat,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.560
the relevant security structures

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.200
of the enterprise are identified,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.560
that is, after studying the possible

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.940
potential threats, assessing the

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.700
degree of risk of their

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.880
occurrence, assessing the possible

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.220
damage from these threats, we identify

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.720
those directions that need to be

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.520
protected, thus creating the security

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.400
structure of our business.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.240
You can distinguish several components,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.480
in the first place it is information security,

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.220
to which we include protection of

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.460
technical channels, protection

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.760
against information leakage,

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.800
protection of personnel,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.560
protection of document turnover.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.700
Further, financial security,

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.160
economic security, personnel

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.020
security, physical security,

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.660
legal security, and a

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:06.280
separate type of security structure

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.240
we include information-analytical

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.000
support of security

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.260
services, so-called competitive

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.100
intelligence.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.720
This is a new direction that appeared

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:22.160
in Russian business quite recently,

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:26.120
which provides the study of the

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:29.860
activities of competitors, the study of

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.140
the competitive environment.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.960
This activity has become possible due to

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.180
the emergence of new information

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.020
technologies and the transformation

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.240
of information into a commodity.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.300
We will also discuss this issue

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.520
in a separate topic of our

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.340
seminar today.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.280
Business security information

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.420
and analytics support.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.440
The new topic, the fourth topic,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.120
is the topic that is related to competitive

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:07.000
intelligence.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.760
We are talking about information

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:18.080
and analytics work in the company.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.440
Speaking of this direction, we believe

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.940
that the information and analytical

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.340
activities of the enterprise are

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.880
primarily related to the identification

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:31.620
of threats in the early stages

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.920
of their appearance.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.420
This is competitive intelligence.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.960
Let us define what we understand

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.000
by competitive intelligence.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.320
It is possible to give such a definition

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.500
as information-analytical

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.080
activity, not a state organization

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.640
or a natural person, aimed

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.600
at achieving competitive

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.540
superiority and carried

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.640
out by legal legal

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.780
methods.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.260
That is, competitive intelligence,

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.400
unlike industrial spy, is engaged

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.320
in open sources of information,

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.660
uses first of all the information

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.280
opportunities that have emerged

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:21.520
and the tools that were previously

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.140
unavailable to the businessman

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.940
- entrepreneur.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.520
We are talking about new information

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.980
technologies, such as the Internet,

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.620
information analytical systems,

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.420
allowing to analyze the process

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.300
of searching and analyzing

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.160
information and drawing up

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.740
causal chains.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.460
These are professional databases,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.040
existing in a large number and

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.500
made available to most entrepreneurs,

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.020
both Russian and foreign

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.700
databases, primarily full-text

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:01.640
databases LexisNexis, are

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.000
databases Dun &amp; Bradstreet,

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.120
allowing to obtain information

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.580
about companies, more

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.780
than 140 million records

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.920
on companies.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.540
These are Factiv systems and a number

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.920
of others that have already successfully

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.380
entered the Russian market and are

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.800
used by some companies quite effectively.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.300
With the entry into the Russian

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.500
market of foreign companies, the

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.860
activity of the company should

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.660
develop very strongly, since Western

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.100
companies in their activities

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.940
have long been using competitive

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:47.740
intelligence as the main mechanism

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.900
in both marketing research and

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.260
the work of information and

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:56.220
analytical units of security services.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.080
The main purpose of competitive intelligence,

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.760
as I have said, is to identify signs

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.380
of threats at the early stages

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.060
of their occurrence, well, and competitive

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.940
which in general has introduced

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:30.360
this concept to the wider usage.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.720
He defined competitive intelligence

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.840
as a radar that allows in the

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.440
darkness, in the fog, to detect

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.880
those dangers that guard a business

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.820
ship.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.460
What are the main points of

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:50.400
competitive intelligence?

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.060
One we have already said, it is the

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.700
model of Michael Porter, and the second

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.740
basic point is the intelligence

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.640
cycle, so the intelligence cycle

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.300
consists of four main stages, the stage

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.700
of setting the task, the stage of collecting

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.940
information, the analysis of

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.280
information and the presentation

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.540
of the results of the analysis

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.680
to the decision maker.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.320
The intelligence cycle is the same for

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.680
all types of intelligence, so at

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.740
present all these processes, including

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.180
the process of setting a task,

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.420
have the possibility to use

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.700
new information technologies, but

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.580
of course, first of all, these

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:34.560
technologies are related to

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.620
the collection and analysis

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.920
of information.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.060
The tasks that competitive

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.140
intelligence solves can be divided

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.040
into two large classes.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.660
The first class is tactical

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.480
tasks, which include checks,

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.660
checks of business partners,

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:55.140
checks of competitors, checks

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.220
of recruited persons.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.160
In general, the tasks of inspections

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:04.520
are very important in the activities

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:06.520
of the competitive intelligence service,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.680
together with the personnel apparatus

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.880
of these marketing with

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.220
the security departments of

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.900
the first persons.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.700
What tasks are included in

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:28.040
tactical, in addition to checks, are

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.000
preparations for negotiations,

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.520
preparations for journeys, preparations

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
for some conferences,

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.860
in which your company participates,

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.760
exhibitions.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.440
The compilation of a dossier is also a

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.820
large class of tactical tasks, it is the

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.180
compilation of a dossier or portraits

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.500
of the decision-makers of the

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.360
competitor and of the enterprise

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.900
as a whole.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.000
Such a document as a certificate

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.800
of the activity of a competitor

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.780
is very widespread and these

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.500
certificates form the basis

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.660
of the company's own databases.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.080
Tactical tasks can be considered

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:18.220
quite a lot of tasks, but great

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:24.180
attention is now paid to strategic

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.960
tasks, first of all this is the

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.760
creation of a positive, positive

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.220
image of the enterprise in the public,

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.840
this is the struggle

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.580
with the black market, this

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:43.140
is the provision of access

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.200
to new markets both geographical

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.760
and commodity.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.360
Well, very interesting tasks are

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.980
solved by competitive intelligence,

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.080
unusual to some extent, it is the struggle

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.040
with headhunting and the search

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:04.680
for new personalities of new personnel,

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.580
it is the search for a compromise

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.980
on its leader, because it means

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.960
finding such a compromise,

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.840
it can be somehow softened

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.100
in the eyes of the public.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:22.540
If we do not find it, the competitor

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.800
will find this compromise and present

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.880
it in a much more negative light.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.350
So, the next important issue for

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.270
competitive intelligence is

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.930
information resources.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.850
I will not stop on this issue for long,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.450
I want to say only that in the last

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.790
three to four years the possibilities

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.070
of competitive intelligence to access

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.990
information have increased dramatically.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.170
So, the accession of Russia to the

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.570
WTO required Russian enterprises

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.730
to submit transparent business

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.350
information about their activities,

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.890
this was one of the most important

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.890
conditions for Russia's admission

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.730
to the WTO and now information about

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.770
companies starts with legal entities,

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:32.630
individuals, what is represented

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.970
by the State Commerce.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:38.110
This is information of such agencies

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:43.290
as Finmarket, AKM, Integrum,

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:44.450
Rosbiznes Consulting.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:46.270
That is, this market

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.290
of information services and

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:50.730
resources is quite rapidly

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.690
developing, the Russian

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:52.790
market.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.890
In the West, this market has been around

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.750
for a long time and successfully.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.170
The leaders of this market, I already mentioned

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.430
Lexis, Nexus, mentioned Dialogue, Don

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.850
and Bradstreet, they are very successful

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.230
in getting introduced to the

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.690
Russian market.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:09.390
And the competitive intelligence

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.390
tool, also two words about the tool.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.430
These are information and analytical

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.810
systems that allow to

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.170
automatize the processes of collecting

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.910
and analyzing information

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.830
on the use of the Internet as a database

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.270
of the Internet and paid online

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.310
personal data.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:34.770
That is, the Internet is searched,

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.650
patterns are identified, facts that

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.870
interest the analyst are identified.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.530
And the whole process is automated.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:47.450
Such systems as Russian systems,

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.990
Galactica, Zoom, Semantic,

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:53.330
Archive, Acumen, and a number

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.830
of others, where about 15 domestic

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.150
information and analytical systems

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.730
are present on the Russian

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.390
market and are a very effective

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.290
tool for competitive intelligence

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.270
analysts.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.780
The fifth is personnel safety.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.220
Personal security issues are the

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:34.000
most personnel issues all decide.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.060
This is also relevant for

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:38.900
our time.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.360
It is the personnel that are primarily

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:46.080
the object of the aspirations of the abusers.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.780
And the personnel can also

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.340
be abusers who can have

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:58.800
an impact on the company.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.640
Therefore, a lot of attention is paid to

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:04.220
work with personnel.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.980
What issues does the security service

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.800
solve when working with personnel?

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.760
It should be stressed that these issues are

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.460
solved, of course, together with

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.800
the personnel machines.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.260
This is primarily organizational

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:20.760
and legal issues.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.440
Further, these are questions of checking and

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.320
recruitment of personnel when accepting for employment.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.420
This is a safe relationship

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:37.160
with current employees.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.780
Safety of work during preparation

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.820
for dismissal and after

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.260
dismissal.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.720
Well, such issues as conducting investigations

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.620
of various incidents

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:54.100
that occurred at the enterprise.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:59.620
and agency work for the company.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.660
Now let us go to the discussion

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:04.560
of these issues in more detail.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.980
First, the selection of staff.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.720
What quality should a future

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:12.940
employee meet?

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.740
First of all, this employee should

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.860
be a professional in his business.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.400
Furthermore, this employee must

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.840
comply with the rules set forth

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.100
in your company.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.600
And one of the most important rules

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.820
is to observe the confidentiality

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:37.080
mode, to observe the mode of

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:41.380
working with secret information.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.280
It means compliance with the rules

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:47.740
of conduct in the company.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.660
There are various methods of

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.680
professional selection for

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:56.800
safe search and recruitment.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.460
These can be methods related to the

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.720
study of the future employee, an

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.640
employee of surveys.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.180
These are methods for studying questionnaire

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:14.760
data and requests to various law

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.460
enforcement and other bodies.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.580
Meetings with former employers.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.120
Nowadays, technical or software-

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.960
based means of human behavior

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:31.240
control are being

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.680
widely used.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.720
This is a polygraph or a lie

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:38.980
detector.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.700
A new psychological method.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.000
The method is quite interesting and tried.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.520
Also, great attention is paid to

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.840
conducting various test tests,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:07.720
different types of interviews,

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.380
questionnaires.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.080
When carrying out such verification

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.880
activities, we carry out comparisons,

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:22.080
analyze the information received

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.260
and therefore give recommendations

00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.400
on admission or

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.820
refusal of work.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.300
A lot of attention should be paid

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:39.920
to such issues as the candidate's

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:42.600
inclination to gambling,

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.940
tendency to use drugs,

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.400
alcohol.

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.440
Such points are difficult to

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.520
identify, and in this regard,

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:59.260
various testing methods, using

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:11.880
personnel management and, first

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.960
of all, the safety of the company's

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.060
personnel documentation,

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.900
provide great help.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.580
Existing rules of conduct, existing

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.340
rules of access to information

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.860
constituting a commercial

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:32.040
secret, are determined on

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.700
each enterprise independently.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.900
The basis of the law is the law on

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:41.980
commercial secrets, which provides

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:46.240
for the provisions defining the work

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:49.580
with information constituting a commercial

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:52.520
secret and defining the list

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.360
of those information that cannot

00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:57.900
be a commercial secret.

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.260
These are documents related

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:04.580
to licensing, environmental,

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.920
constituent documents.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.580
The most important point of ensuring

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.000
the security of confidential

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:17.020
information is the organization

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:20.500
of a closed document of turnover,

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:24.020
and questions of information about

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:26.100
personnel, questions about personal

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:31.060
data, they are mandatory.

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.220
These documents must be included

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:36.000
in the protected documents of circulation.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.480
Safety work with current

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:40.860
employees.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.540
Look at the slide, here are

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.120
the main directions of safe

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:50.420
work with current employees

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:52.060
of the enterprise.

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.360
Here is the next slide.

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.840
First, the loyalty of the organization.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.540
Ensuring the loyalty of the staff

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.740
of this organization is the

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.440
main direction of educational

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.840
work at the enterprise.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.620
This includes motivation

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:16.300
of staff.

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:19.000
The motivation of the staff can

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.580
be divided into material and intangible.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.200
Material and intangible incentives

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.900
are the leverage that will

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.800
allow the company to have

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.060
loyal staff.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.580
And loyal staff, as is known, will

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.460
first care about the security and

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.560
information, and the safety of their

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:45.160
enterprise, because they understand

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.320
that this is directly related

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.540
to their financial

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:54.320
situation and with their work.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.140
Control of the company staff.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.120
There is a voiced and a voiced surveillance.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.980
This is especially true

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.480
for, goods from the staff

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.520
is a sick problem for trade

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.620
enterprises.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.300
Therefore, various control

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.400
methods are widely used,

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.340
including technical control

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.520
means.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.380
It is about video cameras, audio

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.000
control, but what you need to

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:36.140
pay attention to.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.320
When organizing video control of the

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.120
actions of the staff, it is necessary

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.160
to take a subscription from the

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.320
staff when taking up work that they are

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.580
familiar with the fact that video

01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:55.980
control will be carried out over their actions.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.360
Video controls cannot be performed

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.540
in public places such

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.260
as the dressing room or

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.880
bathroom.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.700
Questions of honesty.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.380
Also a rather difficult question.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.940
The so-called mysterious

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.400
buyer method is now

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.860
being applied.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.260
Mysterious buyer, when a person

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:29.260
from the controlling bodies of a

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:32.100
given company under the ordinary

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:35.780
buyer carries out trading operations,

01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:37.060
that is, participates in

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:40.200
trading operations as a buyer.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.780
This person arranges various types of

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.960
checks and gives an assessment

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:51.300
of the characteristics of the actions

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.000
of the salespeople.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.100
Such forms of mysterious

01:02:56.110 --> 01:03:02.720
buyer begin not only in trade

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.940
enterprises, but also in

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:08.040
show business enterprises,

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.440
in food.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.060
The mysterious buyer evaluates how the

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.640
employees of the organizations

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:24.540
are dealing with him.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.700
Safe working with public organizations

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:29.660
in the enterprise.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.880
As is strange, social

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:35.360
organizations can also pose

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:38.160
a threat to the business.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:42.140
This is especially true of various environmental

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.780
organizations that, without even understanding,

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.520
without knowing it, can perform

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.720
the will of competitors

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:55.540
or some organizations

01:03:55.550 --> 01:04:00.000
associated with religious

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.660
manifestations.

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:05.100
First of all, we are talking

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:08.280
about different sects that can

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.740
significantly influence the activity

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.640
of the enterprise, creating informal

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.200
groups that can harm the main

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:20.300
activities of the enterprise.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:25.200
The next issue is related to

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.420
work and after dismissal of employees.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.960
The dismissal procedure is

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:42.040
always painful for the employee

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.200
you work with.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.520
If the employee leaves peacefully,

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.160
then problems usually do not occur.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.120
The problem is that when dismissed

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:01.440
by an unwanted person or dismissed,

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.820
when a person leaves not in

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.100
his will or leaves offended,

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.340
this person can pose a great

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.120
potential threat

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:14.020
to the business.

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:16.020
This is primarily due to the fact

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.160
that this person is suffering

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:23.260
from the person with whom he has

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:24.460
had a conflict.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.380
It can be the master, it can be the

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.520
head of the department.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.480
So, a person carries on all the

01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:34.500
enterprises as a whole

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.380
the dissatisfaction that caused

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.820
him conflict with

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:40.680
his immediate head.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.580
This person may think about some

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.660
questions.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:53.840
This person is well aware of

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:56.380
the vulnerabilities that exist

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.480
in the enterprise and has contacts

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.800
with people working

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.640
at the enterprise.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:07.340
The danger from these

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:10.400
people is quite high.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.880
This danger can be

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.440
realised for a long time.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:22.300
We do not know when an attack can

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:25.380
begin, because the conditions

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.140
and capabilities for such an

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:32.060
attack can mature in a month,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.240
in two, in three.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.580
This is problem.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.840
When dismissed, the personnel services

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:43.100
together with the security

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.860
service must issue the obligations

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.900
of the dismissed employee

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:51.120
to the former employer.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.140
If a person has been admitted to

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.120
confidential information by the

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.220
nature of his work, then he

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:00.840
or she is signed that he or she

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.980
cannot pass this confidential

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.660
information to anyone else for

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:08.380
a certain period of time.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.980
Sometimes before the conclusion of the

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.680
contract, a documentary obligation

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:20.620
is made that a person will not

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:23.180
enter the company competitor.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:29.060
This does not happen in all cases.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.900
When a dismissal begins or

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.780
when we receive information

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:38.380
that a person plans to leave that

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:43.980
job, we should start restricting

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:46.340
that person's access to resources

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.520
before dismissal and monitoring

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:53.060
his behavior, as that person

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.120
may take with him the various

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:59.040
information resources

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.920
he had access to.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.460
Therefore, before dismissal, we

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:07.500
are obliged to remove him from business

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:10.200
processes and transfer responsibilities

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:13.000
and limit his powers.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.100
Moreover, these actions must be started

01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:18.720
not immediately, before dismissal,

01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:20.020
but for some certain time,

01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:23.320
so that the person does not have

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:33.560
the last few words about the organizational

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:36.100
and legal foundations of safe

01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:39.060
work with personnel.

01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:41.620
In the first place in their work,

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.040
personnel and security services

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:45.760
should focus on the

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.360
legislation of the

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:48.560
Russian Federation in the

01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:51.340
field of regulation of labor

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:52.560
relations.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.260
Also defining document are the

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.460
regulations of the enterprise

01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:01.360
in the field of business safety.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.040
This includes the company's

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:07.920
security charter.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:12.800
Here we bring the documents.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.820
This is a list of information

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.620
constituting a commercial secret

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.040
of the company, which is approved

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.180
by the head, functional duties

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.560
of the service employees admitted

01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:32.300
to information containing a commercial

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:34.500
secret.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.500
These regulatory documents are mandatory

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.660
for implementation, and these documents

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:44.760
define the rights and obligations

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:47.700
of people working with confidential

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.880
information.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.300
An important place in the organizational

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:58.640
and legal work is the place of the

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:02.040
security service in the enterprise and

01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:04.760
the interaction of the personnel service,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.460
the personnel service with the

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:07.620
security service.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.400
The role of the security service

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:13.000
and personnel units in

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.280
the enterprise should be high

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:21.180
enough to effectively

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:24.060
influence the organization

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:27.620
of the enterprise's security system.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.040
An important point in the work with

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.900
personnel is the conduct and investigation

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:36.280
of incidents that occurred

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.740
at the enterprise.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.220
The company must have an accidents

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:46.980
classification by degree of

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.780
danger, there should be methods

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:53.060
and rules of conduct and investigation,

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:54.900
planning of activities.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.500
In some cases, law enforcement

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.560
agencies should be

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:02.400
involved if a criminal offence

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:05.820
has occurred at the enterprise.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.140
Therefore, the issues of interaction

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:12.020
with law enforcement agencies are also

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:14.460
an important element of personnel

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:17.440
work from the point of view

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:19.200
of ensuring security.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.760
In general, now a new threat,

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.980
which was put at the top of the

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:32.240
threat analysis, which was conducted

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.520
by independent experts in 2004,

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:40.440
is the threat from the so-called

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:43.740
reversal in the pursuit.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.520
And here, with a federal structure,

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.680
and local authority structures often

01:11:56.690 --> 01:11:58.820
exceed their powers.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.140
Therefore, the personnel and security

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:04.020
services of the enterprise must very

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.640
clearly understand how to behave

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:08.260
with representatives of

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:11.380
supervising and controlling organizations.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.120
In this regard, I would like to

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:18.780
advise you to read the book of Sergey

01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:21.340
Ivanovich Puchkov.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.820
I came to you for a check.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.380
The book describes in detail

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:27.780
the procedure for interaction with

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.140
representatives of various

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:33.420
supervisory and control bodies.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.680
When conducting investigations at

01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:41.700
enterprises, we must conduct a thorough

01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:44.000
investigation, starting with the analysis

01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.860
of the crime or incident,

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:48.940
with the analysis of the information

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:50.620
obtained, the construction

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.060
of versions, the involvement of

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.340
investigators that could clarify

01:12:57.350 --> 01:13:01.020
the situation, the determination

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.540
of the measures that need

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:09.500
to be taken to prevent

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.180
such events in the future.

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:13.600


01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:24.970
Now let's get to another

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.170
point, which is closely

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.350
related to human safety.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:34.570
This is the fight against headhunting.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:38.090
I said headhunting is a hunt

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.110
for heads.

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.370
In literal translation, headhunting

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:47.750
is the hunt for heads that becomes

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.270
one of the most effective in competitive

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.930
struggle.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:55.630
That is, we lose a leading

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.470
specialist if our competitors

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.430
can somehow identify the weaknesses

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.950
of this person and

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.070
influence him.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:08.010
At the same time, the competitor

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.190
can engage this specialist in his work.

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:13.570
That means he can strengthen

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.190
his position.

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:19.150
I remember the Pareto rule.

01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.470
Pareto's rule is that 20 percent of

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.190
the people do 80 percent of their

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.730
work, or 20 percent of the Germans

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.470
drink 80 percent of their beer.

01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:38.470
Many such examples can be given.

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:41.850
It is suitable for all

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.590
organizational structures, for

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.950
bees, for ants, for humans.

01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.650
When organizing the security

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.990
system in the company, this rule

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.290
should be taken into account.

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.390
So I will explain.

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:02.310
If you consider the rating of personnel

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.470
from the security position, that is,

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.610
to determine which figures occupy the

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:13.590
most key positions and the loss of which

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.590
figures can cause greater damage to

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.150
the enterprise, then you can build

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.390
such a hierarchy.

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:23.270
First is the system administrator.

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.490
This is about those companies where

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.890
information technology

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.510
becomes the determinant.

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:32.370
These are either banks or some large

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.990
enterprises where the technological

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.030
processes are entirely built on

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.590
the application of computing

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.630
technology.

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:41.450
The system administrator.

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:42.230
The second.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.490
The third place is shared by the Chief Accountant

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.850
and the Chief Executive Officer.

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:48.670
The fourth place is the head

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.000
of the security service.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.200
Why the system administrator?

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.240
I would like to remind you of the

01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:00.080
Soviet times, it is the late 70s.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.520
In the newspapers of the time there

01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:07.920
was an interesting publication that

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:11.100
at the Volt Automobile Plant, the

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:14.640
factory producing cars "Zhyguli"

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:19.380
happened such a case when the system

01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:20.360
administrator did not pay 130

01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:23.820
rubles of the premium he counted

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.800
on, paid 100 rubles, this person

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:29.200
was offended and relieved the stress

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:33.840
of Russian customs, that is, he

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.140
left drinking for three days,

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.340
and the conveyor stopped, the

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.480
main conveyor stopped, no one

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.560
could run this conveyor and

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:46.540
the factory and the country lost

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:49.760
several million full-weight

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:53.100
Soviet rubles, when one ruble

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:57.620
was worth $0.67.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.800
This is what can lead to a human error,

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.720
and if this error is intentional, that

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:07.580
is, the problem of the system administrator

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.480
in one of the central in ensuring

01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:13.000
the security of the enterprise,

01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:15.460
can be replaced, with difficulty

01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:18.200
of course, but it is possible to

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.720
the general director, chief accountant,

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.460
but the system administrator can

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:25.260
put in the work of IT systems

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:27.920
a lot of unpleasant traps and

01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:31.380
therefore the problem of a

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:35.440
good attitude to this administrator

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.600
and protection of this person

01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:39.240
from external influences

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:42.120
becomes and is the headache

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:45.640
of many security services.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.480
How are staff checked?

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.980
We have already talked about this a little,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.120
meaning this or questionnaire methods

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:56.320
of verification, when a person records their

01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:00.060
data in the questionnaire and the personnel

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:01.620
structures verify what he recorded,

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.320
performing queries to personal

01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:09.080
departments, organizations or personnel

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:11.000
verification.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.960
Here on the slide is shown the method SMIKE,

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.720
this is an abbreviation of the American,

01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:21.560
the first letters of the American

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.300
words SEX, S, M, MONEY, money,

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:27.600
ideology, so well, under ideology

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.900
here is understood and the relationship

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:33.420
to religion, to culture, to collections,

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.480
to sports and so on

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:36.620
and so on.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.340
A compromise is C, a compromise is E, and E

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:42.360
is the ego, that is, how a person

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:44.780
positions himself, how he thinks

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:48.300
of himself, who he thinks of himself in society.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.060
And in these five directions, the assessment

01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:54.700
of a person is carried out, meaning this method

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:57.300
was proposed by the U.S. Federal

01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:59.260
Bureau of Investigation, which means that

01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:03.060
the assessment of the employees they were

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.460
checking and the assessment of the

01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:08.840
possibility of recruiting the agency.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.680
Well, it is quite transparent this

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:16.360
method and can be used in the activities,

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:18.980
therefore, the security services

01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:21.660
of commercial enterprises.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.400
So, a man is studying in these

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.060
directions.

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:29.660
I would like to stop in two directions.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.640
The first direction is the ego, let us start

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:35.860
from the end and talk a little about ideology,

01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:38.240
well about ideology in the understanding

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.640
of all these suprastructing,

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:43.480
so to speak, components.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.200
These are sectarian organizations, some

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.140
forms of informal organizations.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.320
Let's start with the ego.

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.440
There was a case when at one enterprise

01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:02.860
representatives of the security service

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:05.660
of the enterprise were in a large,

01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.600
they had a big problem, there

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:10.120
was a leak of computer information,

01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:13.120
and by all external signs, the

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:17.020
source of the leak was a young man,

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:19.380
a programmer, who had, in general

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.980
-that, the possibility of access

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.760
to this information, but by

01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:25.920
its external features he fully

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:28.020
corresponded to that image of

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:30.400
the spy, which, therefore,

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:33.320
is cultivated in the mass media

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:35.160
of information in theaters.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.320
That is, a young man, after

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.540
watching films about James Bond, decided

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:41.860
to position himself, so to

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:47.560
position himself in the role of

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.120
clothes, accordingly presented

01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:52.620
these hats, these black glasses,

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:56.260
this is a long coat in almost

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:58.520
all seasons.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.760
When a certain person appeared in

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:05.480
the office and in the room where

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.380
he worked, he threw the

01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:10.020
phone, left a mysterious

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:16.980
look, always about something familiar

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:18.220
people who came to the

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:21.380
company, that is, in formal

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:24.160
terms he looked like such an

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:28.260
image of a spy that we often

01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:32.920
see in such low-proof detectives.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.420
When they began to seriously check

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.820
his capabilities, it turned out

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.800
that he, of course, had no relation

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:49.160
to his check took a lot of

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.940
time and financial information

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:55.600
costs.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.880
That is, this is how a person

01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:59.980
positiones himself, so, unfortunately,

01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.740
there are currently quite a

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.700
lot of people who have not found themselves

01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:06.760
in society, and here they begin

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.380
to live in different virtual worlds,

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:11.220
and here is one such example

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.580
was given below.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.140
Well, a few words about ideology, also

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.200
a very important point when checking

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:20.340
the staff.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.420
We consider, well, first, this

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.640
direction of ideology as collectivization.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.500
It is known that if a person

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.600
collects, whether he is an academic

01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.940
there, he will not be accepted

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.780
to work in museums, which have a

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.740
rich collection.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.980
That is, the collector's sense

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:48.120
can often prevail over the

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.540
obligations to the organization.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.260
Or a player.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:55.780
A very dangerous type of staff,

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:58.980
when people start to be interested

01:22:58.990 --> 01:23:02.520
in games, starting with computer

01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:04.640
games and ending with

01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:06.180
gambling.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.000
This can also lead to gambling,

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.400
and we can already talk about

01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:17.980
such addiction, about computer

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:20.520
addiction, like drug and

01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:22.260
alcohol addiction.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.640
By looking at the people being checked,

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:28.420
the staff being checked from different

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:31.980
angles, we can identify

01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:36.160
trends that can lead to information

01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:39.120
leakage and unreliability

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:40.940
of staff.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.180
The inspection of personnel by the SMAYC method

01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:45.320
is one of the types of inspection.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.780
And checks are usually complex

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.400
when checked by several methods,

01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:52.040
especially when appointed to

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:55.600
important critical positions.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.820
I have already spoken about

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.420
the use of software and hardware,

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.900
technical means, in particular, on

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.040
personnel, on polygraph.

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.760
It should be noted that the check

01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:13.480
on the polygraph for commercial

01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:15.660
structures, possible with a lie

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:25.120
detector, the personnel equipment

01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:27.620
has only with his written

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:28.740
consent.

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:30.580
According to the Law on Private

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:32.480
Security and Detective Activities,

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.880
such checks are allowed.

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.920
For employees of government

01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:39.960
structures, such checks are

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.840
often mandatory.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.860
Now we move to a new topic.

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.600
The new theme is the sixth

01:24:57.610 --> 01:25:00.660
theme – counteracting corporate seizures.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.900
One of the most challenging topics

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:06.980
for security services

01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:10.140
is counteracting corporate seizures.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.900
Unfriendly absorption is

01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:14.660
becoming a very dangerous

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:17.080
phenomenon for Russian entrepreneurs,

01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:19.260
and from the media we

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.920
see how many cases are

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.160
linked to this side

01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:27.980
of unfair competition.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:32.060
We consider unfriendly acquisition

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:34.780
as a type of corporate

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:37.520
conflict, and let

01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:39.440
us define what it

01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:40.160
is.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.120
By unfriendly acquisition we mean the

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.740
establishment of complete control

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:50.620
over that company or asset, both

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:53.600
in the legal and physical sense,

01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:56.720
contrary to the will of management

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.460
or the will of the owner of that

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:00.480
company or asset.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.120
Here is a very important sign that

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.360
the action of the aggressor

01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:11.780
company is always the resistance

01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:13.900
of the company's target.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.320
Here we distinguish in this process,

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:23.580
the process of unfriendly seizure

01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:26.040
of assets or companies, and the company's

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:30.100
target whose assets

01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:32.900
are threatened.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.020
The first step in unfriendly

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:40.080
absorption can often be a green mail.

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.880
Green mail or corporate blackmail

01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.920
is a complex of various negative

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:49.300
effects that are undertaken

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.620
by a minority shareholder

01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:55.800
in order to force a company

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:58.260
or its major shareholders

01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:00.720
to purchase shares belonging

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.700
to this minority at a very

01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:04.720
high price.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:09.120
That is, we can say that in Russia

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:11.780
there has been a new kind of

01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:15.840
unfriendly influence, when a person

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:19.920
purchasing a small package of shares

01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:22.560
or acting on the authority of a minoritarian

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:26.620
begins to conduct a very aggressive

01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:29.080
policy, a policy of blackmail

01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.520
against the management of

01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:35.240
the company in order to force

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:38.980
this company to pay very

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:43.440
large shares.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.160
That is, it is a green mail, in translation

01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:49.820
green is a green, dollars, mail is a

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:53.340
mail, that is, sending money by mail,

01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:59.160
it gives the definition of a green mail.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.320
The activity of the green-meiler,

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:06.060
and the person who carries out these

01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:07.920
negative actions, he is called the green-

01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:11.400
meiler, is always aimed at destabilizing

01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:12.640
the position in the joint-

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:15.520
stock society and disrupting

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:19.140
the normal functioning of this society.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.500
The scheme of action is quite simple.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.240
Initially, a scenario is developed,

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.080
the company that can serve as an

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:30.920
object of influence is

01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:33.520
identified, the surrounding of this

01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:35.220
company is studied, the

01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:37.140
possibilities of this company

01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:39.440
to attract an administrative

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:41.440
resource, law enforcement

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:45.640
agencies or criminal groups are studied.

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.800
Furthermore, the company's response

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.080
to the efforts of the green mailers

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:56.060
is being studied after the scenario has been

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:59.620
developed and the decision to start

01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:01.900
the attack has been made.

01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:05.280
The action itself begins, namely, a small

01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:07.200
package of shares or a power of

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:10.280
attorney from a small shareholder is acquired.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.680
Furthermore, existing or misguided

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:16.100
violations in the joint-stock company

01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:18.640
are used to disorganize its activities.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.240
That is, it can be incorrectly

01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:21.980
issued property documents,

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:23.920
incorrectly issued

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:27.060
privatization documents,

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:39.500
some decisions.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.920
That is, any violations in

01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:43.280
the activities of a joint-stock company

01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.460
are used by green-mealers to

01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:48.780
create such a difficult situation,

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.020
a situation when some court

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:54.020
proceedings begin.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.660
That is, people are dragging

01:29:57.670 --> 01:29:59.680
society into scandals.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.380
And in order to get rid of these scandals,

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:04.720
at the last stage, the green-mailer

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:08.500
makes the management of

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.660
the company a proposal to buy

01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:14.740
his shares, but at a higher

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:15.480
price.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.740
The goal of the green-mealers is money.

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.240
But if the green-meiler sees, usually behind

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:26.300
the back of the green-meiler there

01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:28.900
are quite powerful forces, if these forces

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:32.080
see that the enterprise is inadequately

01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:34.980
reflecting these threats, that is, the

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.940
enterprise begins to break, so

01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:41.980
say, then it is possible to continue

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:44.160
the action of the green-meiler already

01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.540
aimed at seizing the assets of the enterprise.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.880
The stock-buying begins, the

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.240
extortion of the management begins, and eventually

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:55.580
this affair ends with

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.020
the seizure of either an asset or the

01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:01.260
enterprise as a whole.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.120
What is in the green-meiler arsenal?

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.400
Complaints to various bodies

01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:10.420
for the purpose of conducting

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.840
checks in respect of the company,

01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:15.040
its officials, shareholders, permanent

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:19.060
demands for holding extraordinary

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:21.060
meetings of shareholders,

01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:23.840
unjustified appeal of decisions

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.820
and actions of the management

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:30.400
bodies of the company.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.540
Often to disorganize the work of a

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:37.320
joint-stock company, green mailers resort

01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:40.880
to such tricks, they can complain

01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:44.560
to the regional branches of the federal

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.200
commission under a securities, if copies

01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:50.240
of the documents of the

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.200
company are not presented

01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:53.940
within the time limit, that is, the

01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:56.840
green mailers require a copy of the

01:31:56.850 --> 01:31:59.840
documents on any issue that

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:01.440
is discussed at the meeting.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.820
Or very often use this technique of

01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:08.140
not including part of the

01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:11.820
nominated candidates in the list for

01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.900
voting in the elections, the

01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:16.200
green-mailer begins to nominate one,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.740
the second, the third candidate.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.940
And when the patience of the leaders

01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:29.020
of the assembly is over and

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:33.800
its candidatures are not included,

01:32:33.810 --> 01:32:36.120
then this moment can serve as

01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:38.240
a basis for recognizing the

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:40.180
invalidity of the general assembly decision.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.600
If the documents stipulate the

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:45.460
number of candidates being submitted

01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:47.600
by one person, that is, the green-

01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:50.160
mailer always studies and very carefully

01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:52.740
studies the issues, procedures

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.240
for conducting all sorts of activities,

01:32:56.250 --> 01:33:00.640
and finding some trap or finding

01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:02.460
some vulnerability, he

01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:04.820
begins to develop this vulnerability.

01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:05.680


01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:09.860
Or green mailers require

01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:11.920
extraordinary general meetings

01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:14.520
on any matter, if they

01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:15.700
have a certain amount

01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:17.920
of interest, a

01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:20.980
certain number

01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:22.380
of shares.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.540
Very often green mailers try to arrest

01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:28.780
on the eve of important transactions

01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:33.700
for society, and green mailers, as

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:36.720
a rule, have good enough contacts

01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:40.100
with representatives of the

01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:41.960
judiciary, that is, the actions

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.400
of green mailers, this is not

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.380
the action of one person, but the

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:55.380
action of a team that works in

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.000
one direction, namely in selling

01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:01.480
their shares for very large

01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:02.660
sums.

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.820
Special methods of influence on

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:08.300
management of the company green-mealers

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:12.500
apply to solve their tasks.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.080
In particular, for example, they file

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:18.220
lawsuits against members of the board

01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:20.340
of directors or persons exercising

01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:22.620
executive powers, that is, there

01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.460
is constant pressure on any issue,

01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:30.280
pressure on the management

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:34.320
of the company or large shareholders.

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:38.800
Often serious problems are created

01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:41.420
for enterprises, managers and

01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:45.020
shareholders, because formally

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:46.900
green mailers act within the law,

01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:50.240
and since often enterprises

01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:53.920
violate laws or are on the verge

01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:55.980
of violation of laws, green

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.820
mailers enjoy imperfections

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.980
and legal system, well,

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.300
imperfection of the

01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:03.520
actions of entrepreneurs

01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:08.200
and managers of enterprises.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:12.540
Let's look at the internal device

01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:14.000
of the company Aggressor.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.800
That is, green mailers are as if the

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:20.720
leading link of those companies that

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:25.340
in their form began to use seizure

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.880
as a kind of independent business.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.220
That is, unfriendly acquisition

01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:33.880
is considered as an independent

01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:35.740
business process that

01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.560
is governed by

01:35:37.570 --> 01:35:41.100
certain rules, by

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:44.740
certain laws.

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:49.840
One of the components of the project

01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:52.800
on destabilization, on

01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:54.480
unfriendly acquisition is the

01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:57.540
destabilization of the business

01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:58.960
processes of the company.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.860
That is, the company Aggressor

01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:03.760
begins its activities, launching

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.720
green-mailers as before

01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:07.860
in wrestling.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.880
At first, a young boy, a

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:13.000
small boy, was released, who

01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:15.900
struck the enemy team.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.000
This is the role of the green-mealer.

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:23.320
If, therefore, the company does not

01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:26.160
hold this blow, then the process

01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:28.660
begins to develop and from

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.620
the requirement to buy shares, these

01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:35.360
requirements go to attempts to

01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:37.520
seize assets or seize the enterprise

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:39.000
as a whole.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.920
What elements does the Aggressor

01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:42.900
Company consist of?

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:45.600
What structural units are

01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:47.520
the main for such a company?

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.940
The first is the department responsible for collecting

01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:52.220
and analyzing information.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.380
A department that serves intelligence

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:56.040
purposes.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.180
The second is the process of directly

01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:02.740
implementing capture, the

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.360
process of non-priced absorption.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.560
A very important place in the activity of

01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:09.820
the company Aggressor occupies the

01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:10.960
legal department.

01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.960
Let's see what information

01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:23.540
the aggressor is interested in.

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:25.980
First of all, this is information of

01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:28.980
a personal business nature, it is weaknesses

01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:31.600
of people, it is addiction of people,

01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:33.440
it is informal leaders, it is personal

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.500
hostility in the team, especially

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.340
hostility between managers

01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:42.180
of enterprises, possible

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.340
focuses of conflict, opposition.

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:48.560
That is, information is collected

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:51.100
that would allow Aggressor

01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:54.460
to disrupt the work of the team

01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:57.160
and identify those dissatisfied

01:37:57.170 --> 01:37:59.040
who could become their

01:37:59.050 --> 01:38:00.980
allies.

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.940
Such information is necessary

01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:10.420
for Aggressor to implement

01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.420
its plans.

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:14.360
Plus, this is the information collected

01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:17.500
by the intelligence department, but in

01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:19.900
addition, the intelligence department

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:23.580
is studying the company's environment

01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:26.200
in order not to turn from the company

01:38:26.210 --> 01:38:27.800
Aggressor to the company Purpose.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.460
That is, the intelligence department evaluates

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:33.960
the counterpart's capabilities,

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:36.180
so to speak, from the company's Target.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.220
This information is transmitted to

01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:42.560
the legal department, which analyzes

01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:45.420
the information received from the position

01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:48.660
of violation of the laws.

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.840
And also the legal department

01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:55.760
is studying possible actions of

01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:58.020
the company Aggressor from the

01:38:58.030 --> 01:39:01.100
point of view of the law, violates

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.240
the law or not.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.980
That is, the legal department recommends

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.480
the procedure for conducting actions

01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:11.720
of the second department and, therefore,

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:16.520
assesses the legal frequency of

01:39:16.530 --> 01:39:17.860
conducting its operations.

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:20.620
In general, Aggressor companies have

01:39:20.630 --> 01:39:22.320
very powerful legal units

01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:24.520
and have, as a rule, good

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:25.920
informal relations with the

01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:28.260
judicial authorities.

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:36.340
What can the company do to protect

01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:37.880
itself?

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:41.280
What preventive systems of

01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:43.140
protection against unfriendly acquisition

01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:45.700
should be implemented?

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.280
First, it is the formation of a

01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:52.000
protected corporate structure.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.740
This is the organization of monitoring

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:56.060
the current situation, that is, the

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.620
identification of the first signs of attacks on the company.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.480
Attacks can be either the purchase

01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:07.060
of shares starts unexpectedly,

01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:11.020
or it can be the interest of some

01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:13.320
minorities who have never been

01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:16.120
interested in the affairs of

01:40:16.130 --> 01:40:18.220
a joint-stock company.

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:25.440
Suddenly they or their documents

01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:28.380
about the company's activities,

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:31.380
or the appearance of negative

01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:33.680
articles about the enterprise,

01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:37.360
or unexpected checks by supervisory

01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:38.380
and control bodies.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:41.220
That is, many can be identified specific

01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:46.180
indicators of the onset of attacks.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.720
Further, such a system is effective motivation

01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:51.900
and limitation of the powers of the

01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:52.980
managers of the enterprise.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.140
A very important point, because in most

01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:58.940
cases, the company aggressors are

01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:02.100
looking for allies in the person of

01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:04.220
someone from the company's executives.

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.980
And the motivation of existing

01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.960
leaders should be successful

01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:11.580
enough that these leaders

01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:15.120
do not look aside.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.300
The limitation and division

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.160
of powers is very important.

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.740
That is, in the hands of one

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.100
leader should not concentrate

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:27.520
a lot of forces, so that this person

01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:30.980
is not in his interests not to

01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:34.400
sell, in the quotes not to sell, assets

01:41:34.410 --> 01:41:37.780
and enterprises not belonging

01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:42.080
to him company - the aggressor.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.980
One of the preventive protective measures

01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:47.840
is the creation of conditions

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:51.240
that prevent the mass buying of shares.

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.640
That is, shareholders, as a rule,

01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:55.340
shareholders are employees

01:41:55.350 --> 01:42:00.580
of the enterprise, must

01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:05.860
in some way control the number

01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.640
of shares they have, to control

01:42:07.650 --> 01:42:09.780
the start of the massive

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:13.600
start of the purchase

01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:16.020
attack.

01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:18.400
And a very important point is

01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:20.680
the creation of a monitoring

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.840
system, a system of control over

01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:24.540
the company's creditorship.

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:28.680
That is, often the company collects

01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:31.880
loans and does not control the total

01:42:31.890 --> 01:42:33.480
amount of loans that the

01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:35.820
company-agressor uses and buys

01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:39.400
these debts from creditors, after

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:44.540
which it begins to dictate its terms.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.240
Now let's look at tactical ways

01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:49.380
to protect against unfriendly absorption

01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:51.100
in the conditions of the attack

01:42:51.110 --> 01:42:52.180
that has begun.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.620
First of all, it is a shares

01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:56.860
and shares buyer.

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.140
That is, the next urgent

01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:07.140
restructuring of assets in the

01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:10.580
company is the purpose and transfer

01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:12.820
of these assets to either subsidiaries

01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:15.680
or other friendly companies.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.800
This is the blocking of a package

01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:20.480
of shares acquired by the company-

01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:22.280
aggressor, with simultaneous

01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.460
conduct of an additional mission.

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.320
That is, carrying out an additional

01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:28.600
mission expands the number of shares,

01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:34.760
and these shares can be provided to

01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:37.660
the company-aggressor.

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.440
The most important way, of course,

01:43:39.450 --> 01:43:41.320
is to work with shareholders,

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.460
to explain with shareholders,

01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:44.480
to bind these shareholders

01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:46.460
to their company.

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:50.440
And of course, it is protection through attack.

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:01.440
It is at the beginning of the attack

01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:03.660
to start their game, again, defense

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:07.340
through attack, start the fight

01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:09.780
against the media and fight against

01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:15.400
the specific perpetrators

01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:19.220
of those aggressive intentions.

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.460
Defending through attack is the

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:23.720
best weapon.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:37.860
Now we move to the seventh topic

01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:40.780
– the fight against economic terrorism.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.200
The topic is very relevant, very

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.840
important, especially in light of

01:44:45.850 --> 01:44:49.520
recent events, when I speak

01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:54.480
of polonium poisoning of some

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:58.940
“businessmen”, although, in

01:44:58.950 --> 01:45:02.500
my opinion, Litvinenko's cases

01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:04.860
are just about competitive struggle

01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:07.800
between various competing

01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:15.060
commercial organizations.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.140
Now the use of such means – mass

01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:21.600
poisoning, explosives, radioactive

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.860
polonium of this famous

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.760
Russian entrepreneur,

01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:38.360
who in the 90s was also

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:42.000
poisoned with salts of

01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:45.060
the radioactive element.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:48.980
And a number of other similar cases.

01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:53.440
This shows that competitors

01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:54.780
are beginning to use

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:56.980
terrorist methods to solve

01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:58.660
their tasks.

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:04.820
The terrorist targets, or terrorist

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.320
targets, are used in the dark by competitors

01:46:07.330 --> 01:46:09.660
when terrorists don't really

01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:13.140
understand for whose sake they

01:46:13.150 --> 01:46:16.000
are carrying out terrorist acts.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.400
The objectives are first and foremost

01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:20.480
to create an atmosphere of fear in order

01:46:20.490 --> 01:46:21.660
to stop the activity of

01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:24.640
the company or individual employees.

01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:26.580
It is achieved either by blackmail

01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:29.780
of the manager or staff, well, and the

01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:33.900
most vulnerable place is children.

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:37.360
Often the target of terrorists is

01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:39.860
the blackmail of state structures,

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:42.340
that is, there is a terrorist act

01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:44.980
against a large enterprise, or not

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.100
the terrorist act itself, but the

01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:49.600
threat of a terrorist act for the

01:46:49.610 --> 01:46:52.480
blackmail of state structures.

01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:55.100
The destruction of material values can

01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:59.480
also be attributed to the targets of terrorists.

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.680
The spectrum of possible terrorist

01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:04.280
aspirations is quite large.

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.920
You can also remember the explosions of hotels

01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:13.120
in Egypt, on the island of Bali, the explosions

01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:14.160
of buses with tourists.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.480
That is, these, at first glance,

01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:19.640
are political goals, they, in general,

01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:21.820
have a close connection with the struggle

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:22.800
of competitors.

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.060
That is, the struggle in the show

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.040
business, the struggle in the tourism

01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:30.180
business – it is quite tough,

01:47:30.190 --> 01:47:33.860
and it is often accompanied by such

01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:36.980
methods that are more typical for

01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:39.440
terrorists.

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:42.140
Consider the actions of terrorists in preparation

01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:43.780
for the operation.

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.840
First, attempts to implement

01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:51.520
into the management bodies of the enterprise.

01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.440
Furthermore, the acquisition of

01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:57.320
secret intelligence agents within

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.900
the enterprise working

01:47:58.910 --> 01:48:00.200
for terrorist groups.

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:03.380
Study of the system of protection

01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:07.100
of enterprises, the system of communication

01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:09.620
with law enforcement agencies,

01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:11.160
interaction with

01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:13.100
law enforcement agencies.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.280
Therefore, in the preparation of terrorists

01:48:17.290 --> 01:48:20.260
for the operation, some features

01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:23.640
can be identified.

01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:27.780
In particular, the study of the situation

01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:30.320
around the object by unknown

01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:33.340
persons, the finding of unknown

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:35.620
cars for a long time at the enterprise

01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:37.960
gate, inquiries of employees

01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.480
of the enterprise by unknown persons

01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:45.220
about the structure of protection,

01:48:45.230 --> 01:48:47.600
working modes.

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:50.040
All this can serve as

01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:53.400
indicators of alleged actions

01:48:53.410 --> 01:48:56.040
by terrorists and security services.

01:48:56.050 --> 01:49:00.620
You must study these signs.

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:05.300
In the implementation of terrorist

01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:08.520
operations, what types

01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:10.780
of terrorist operations can be

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.900
used against industrialists,

01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:16.640
against businessmen?

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.620
First of all, this is the capture

01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:21.300
of hostages, this is the destruction

01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:24.620
of material values, this is the

01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:26.820
so-called explosive terrorism.

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.960
Explosive terrorism can be divided

01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:31.760
into two categories.

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:35.220
The first is terrorism intimidating,

01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:38.220
when explosives of low

01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:41.800
power or door explosions

01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:47.280
are used, explosions distracting

01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:52.180
car explosions or mailing

01:49:52.190 --> 01:49:54.840
of explosives of low

01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:55.680
power.

01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:59.600
And high power, when a person does

01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:02.020
not agree to the conditions put

01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:04.360
forward by terrorists, high power

01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:06.240
explosions are used to

01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:08.640
physically destroy or

01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:10.840
destroy objects.

01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:13.020
Violation of technological

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:14.960
processes and management structure

01:50:14.970 --> 01:50:16.980
is also a type of

01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:19.640
terrorist operation, and many

01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:23.500
industries can also suffer

01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:29.340
from violations of business processes.

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:34.220
Any terrorist attack consists of several stages.

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.280
Let's look at the preparation stages.

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:41.980
The slide contains four stages.

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:44.300
The first is intelligence training,

01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:48.060
analysis, the environment of the entrepreneur,

01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:52.040
the possibilities for counteracting terrorism,

01:50:52.050 --> 01:50:54.000
that is, the technical and material

01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:58.120
preparation for the conduct of

01:50:58.130 --> 01:50:59.640
a terrorist attack, the execution

01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:02.900
of a terrorist attack, the third and

01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:05.380
fourth stage of cleaning the crime and

01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:07.120
concealing the perpetrators

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:09.080
of the terrorist attack

01:51:09.090 --> 01:51:11.240
are further studied.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:13.560
Signs of explosives

01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:16.340
in mail are shown on

01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:17.880
the slide.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.280
In general, they often try

01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:24.600
to use mail for

01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:27.080
terrorist actions.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.740
This is the transfer of explosives

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:33.960
of low power, it is the transfer

01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:36.440
by mail of various poisonous

01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:40.440
substances, well or attempts to

01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:42.420
blackmail using camouflage,

01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:45.160
well, for example, harmless

01:51:45.170 --> 01:51:49.820
powders, which are also often,

01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:51.900
especially after some

01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:54.540
terrorist acts, and unbalanced

01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:56.960
people, and the so-called

01:51:56.970 --> 01:52:01.240
jokers, send to the directors.

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:07.380
Moreover, the signs of the presence

01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:09.380
of mass destruction means in mailing,

01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:11.700
they are quite well known

01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:15.820
and here are presented on the slide.

01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:18.800
This is the presence of moving objects,

01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:20.860
careful crafting of letters, the presence

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:23.460
of type inscriptions in person in the

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.900
hands and so on.

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.840
Security measures against terrorist

01:52:29.850 --> 01:52:30.920
attacks.

01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:34.360
What should be done to

01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:38.040
protect your business from

01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:39.640
such threats?

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.600
First, it creates an information

01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:45.640
vacuum around the object.

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:47.580
What is happening inside the enterprise

01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:52.460
should not be accessible to

01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:54.620
any terrorist groups or any

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:57.520
other criminal communities,

01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:59.540
competitors.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.500
Creation and training of an object or

01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:06.880
training of the personnel of the object

01:53:06.890 --> 01:53:09.540
on security measures for their strict observance.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:12.440
Safe routes for the movement

01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:16.020
of decision-makers should

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.040
be developed.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.620
Safe routes of transport

01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:23.420
flow have been changed.

01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:25.960
The situation at the place of residence

01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:28.700
and work should be monitored.

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:31.660
Two are those two points that

01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:34.240
are always present in any object.

01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:38.680
The first place is the home and the

01:53:38.690 --> 01:53:39.680
second is the workplace.

01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:42.360
These two places should be

01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:45.040
monitored and some deviations

01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.440
from the current regime

01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:51.560
should be detected.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.420
The time of departure and arrival

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:57.900
to work should be constantly changed.

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.960
There must be timetables for

01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:06.100
the introduction of security

01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:08.580
services in emergency situations.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.240
The nearest environment should be

01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:14.480
trained on the issue of safety.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.600
The rules of conduct should be known

01:54:17.610 --> 01:54:20.640
to family members, secretaries, drivers.

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.660
Engineering and technical protection

01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:25.280
of residential and office premises

01:54:25.290 --> 01:54:26.440
shall be carried out.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.080
Important attention should

01:54:30.090 --> 01:54:32.400
be paid to the preparation of

01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:37.940
danger signals to transmit to relatives

01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:39.840
and security services staff

01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:42.760
information about preparing

01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:44.680
terrorist acts.

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.800
The presence of a worked contact

01:54:49.810 --> 01:54:51.500
with the anti-terrorist centers

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:53.320
of law enforcement agencies.

01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:55.940
Legends of places, the location

01:54:55.950 --> 01:55:00.240
of objects, protection and observation

01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:03.620
of the situation in these places

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.700
must be carried out.

01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:08.180
Possible, potential, and

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:10.380
possible places of terrorist attacks

01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:13.500
are identified and these places

01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:16.520
must be specially protected

01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:17.700
or under surveillance.

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:19.940
There are a number of measures

01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:23.820
to effectively combat

01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:26.580
these threats.

01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.220
The priority of the security

01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.420
service in the event of a terrorist

01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:32.880
act against

01:55:32.890 --> 01:55:34.720
the enterprise.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.680
The security service must have

01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:42.120
a plan of action for various

01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:43.140
terrorist acts.

01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:44.940
Thus, threats should be considered,

01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:47.800
options for security services

01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:49.100
actions should be considered

01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:51.560
when implementing

01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:52.820
a threat.

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:55.320
What should we pay attention to?

01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:57.080
First of all, it is the

01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:59.460
immediate activation of the alarm

01:55:59.470 --> 01:56:02.460
signal and the taking of necessary

01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:04.860
security measures to

01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:06.680
prevent terrorists from leaving

01:56:06.690 --> 01:56:09.120
the facility when confusion

01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:11.380
and panic start.

01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:15.780
The contact with the Department of

01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:18.780
the Ministry of Internal

01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:21.120
Affairs should be organized

01:56:21.130 --> 01:56:23.360
immediately after the attack

01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:26.800
and information should be transmitted

01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:29.420
about the terrorist act.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.760
In the interaction with the employees of

01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:35.940
the MFA, the following information

01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:37.620
should be prepared.

01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:40.440
This is information about the persons involved

01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:42.780
in the incident, that is, about

01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:47.520
the terrorists and those people who

01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:50.840
witnessed this terrorist act with the

01:56:50.850 --> 01:56:54.140
indication of their identification traits.

01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:56.860
The signs of terrorists transport,

01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:59.000
their directions of movement,

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:03.400
data on the results of the terrorist attack,

01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:06.420
information and information about security

01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:08.780
personnel who were on duty at

01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:10.340
the time of the terrorist attack

01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:11.540
should be given.

01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:16.260
These information will

01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:18.880
help law enforcement agencies

01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:22.720
to deal with the terrorist act

01:57:22.730 --> 01:57:27.760
and help in the search for terrorists.

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.800
The last topic of our seminar

01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:41.440
is organizational methods of business

01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:45.660
protection.

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:50.080
Let us go back to the beginning and remember

01:57:50.090 --> 01:57:52.260
the definition of safety.

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.500
We said that security is

01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:57.600
a state of security.

01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.820
Determining the economic

01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:02.460
security of the enterprise, we can

01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:04.740
say that this is the state of the

01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:07.280
given economic object, in which

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:10.020
the vital structures and activities

01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:13.840
of the business process of the

01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:15.900
enterprise are characterized

01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:18.360
by a high degree of protection

01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:22.600
from unwanted changes.

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.760
Security of an enterprise is the

01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:28.760
state of protection of its

01:58:28.770 --> 01:58:30.460
vital interests from external

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:32.100
and internal threats.

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:35.940
Such security is achieved by the

01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:38.340
application of a complex of

01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:40.940
various measures of organizational

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.180
nature, engineering,

01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.380
technical, economic,

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.640
legal, social.

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.320
The security of the enterprise is achieved

01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:51.600
only by the complexity of the application

01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:55.280
of various methods of the enterprise.

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.440
The slide shows a simplified structural

01:58:59.450 --> 01:59:03.620
scheme of the enterprise and the place

01:59:03.630 --> 01:59:06.480
of the security service and the

01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:08.680
structure of this security service.

01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.400
Here you can distinguish the physical

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:15.540
protection service, the protection and access

01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:19.120
control service, the PDTR department, the department

01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:21.340
of counteraction to technical intelligence,

01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:24.500
the counterintelligence service, the internal

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.960
counterintelligence of the enterprise,

01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:29.320
the financial and planning department,

01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:33.340
the legal department and the engineering

01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:36.920
and technical protection

01:59:36.930 --> 01:59:39.340
of information security.

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:42.020
Separately, the information-

01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:43.480
analysis service, the competitive

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.400
intelligence service, is

01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.020
assigned directly

01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:49.020
to the Deputy Director

01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:51.180
of Security or the General

01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.020
Director.

01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:57.860
The security service cannot work

01:59:57.870 --> 02:00:01.140
without interaction with other

02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:02.420
enterprise units, in particular

02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:05.140
with the audit department, with the

02:00:05.150 --> 02:00:08.760
technical director, with the financial

02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:11.680
director and the financial

02:00:11.690 --> 02:00:15.600
service, with the main production,

02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:23.280
structures of the enterprise.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.920
The purpose of ensuring the safety

02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:27.660
of the enterprise, as we have already

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.840
said, is the comprehensive impact on

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:32.700
external and internal threats, allowing

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:35.120
the enterprise to function functionally

02:00:35.130 --> 02:00:37.480
in the complex conditions of

02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:40.980
the external and internal

02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:43.680
environment, in conditions of changing.

02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:48.180
What should be noted is that

02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:50.900
the enterprise security system

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:53.140
in each enterprise is unique,

02:00:53.150 --> 02:00:55.420
that is, we cannot talk

02:00:55.430 --> 02:01:01.500
about a typical set of security

02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:03.220
services.

02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:07.660
This is due to the fact that for each

02:01:07.670 --> 02:01:10.700
enterprise there are its own types of

02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:13.380
threats, the degree of possible

02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:15.960
implementation of these threats

02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:18.220
and its financial capabilities

02:01:18.230 --> 02:01:20.600
to ensure security, its administrative

02:01:20.610 --> 02:01:22.760
links.

02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:26.040
Therefore, the uniqueness of

02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:29.580
the security service is a mandatory element.

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.720
Independent, separated from

02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:33.320
similar systems of other

02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:34.660
production units.

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:37.080
The Security Service

02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:39.980
cannot be part of any other

02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:41.660
structural unit.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.580
A very important point is the complexity

02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:47.280
of the security system,

02:01:47.290 --> 02:01:48.660
that is, the security system

02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:50.400
of the enterprise is

02:01:50.410 --> 02:01:54.040
oriented to solve a complex of

02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:55.580
different problems that

02:01:55.590 --> 02:01:56.980
are facing it.

02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:01.820
The slide shows the basic principles

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.700
of building a security system.

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.540
We will not list them.

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.000
Here are 16 principles, they are all very important.

02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:13.500
What would I like to pay attention to?

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.860
This is a priority for warning measures.

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.720
That is, the security service

02:02:20.730 --> 02:02:23.240
should prevent some

02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:27.540
crimes and minimize possible

02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.500
threats.

02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:32.140
Another very important point

02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:34.920
is legality.

02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:39.600
We did not talk about those norms,

02:02:39.610 --> 02:02:41.460
those laws, on the basis of which

02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:43.520
there is a security service.

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:46.500
The main law is the Law on Private

02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:49.740
Detective and Security

02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:50.980
Activities in the

02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.940
Russian Federation, the

02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:54.320
law of 92 years.

02:02:54.330 --> 02:02:57.960
It regulates the operation of the security

02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:00.540
service at the enterprise, and

02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:02.440
the security service must be

02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:06.740
created in agreement with the

02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:08.460
territorial body of the

02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:10.960
Ministry of Internal Affairs

02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:13.460
and have a head of the security

02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:15.960
service, have a license to

02:03:15.970 --> 02:03:17.960
carry out this activity.

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.880
Based on the above-formulated tasks

02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:24.440
of the security system, the

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:26.160
principles of its construction

02:03:26.170 --> 02:03:28.020
and functioning, the enterprise

02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:30.780
security system can perform

02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:34.500
two such important directions.

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.560
It is a direction of security from

02:03:36.570 --> 02:03:38.840
internal threats and a direction of

02:03:38.850 --> 02:03:41.160
security from external threats.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.480
Depending on these directions, internal

02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:47.000
subsystems are created.

02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.540
First of all, for domestic security, this

02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:51.840
is security, this is the mode, this

02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:54.060
is counterintelligence, computer

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.020
security, counter-operation with

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.160
technical intelligence – this

02:03:58.170 --> 02:04:00.280
is the fight against various kinds

02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:03.100
of radio screens, with information

02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:06.380
leakage channels, and special management

02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:07.520
of personnel.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.640
That is, those tasks that the security

02:04:10.650 --> 02:04:15.540
inspection service solves and the

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.160
main subsystems of external security.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:22.800
Three such subsystems are business intelligence

02:04:22.810 --> 02:04:24.120
or competitive intelligence,

02:04:24.130 --> 02:04:26.320
it is counteraction to the black

02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:29.220
market, that is, counteraction

02:04:29.230 --> 02:04:30.520
to the creation of a negative

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:33.720
image of the enterprise, and external

02:04:33.730 --> 02:04:36.280
counterintelligence is the activity

02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:38.480
that is aimed at identifying

02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:43.180
the actions of our competitors,

02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:46.000
the abusers in relation

02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:50.320
to our enterprise.

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:56.700
Methods and means of information protection.

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.580
We have already talked about these methods.

02:05:00.590 --> 02:05:03.960
These are organizational methods.

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.400
The courts shall include appropriate

02:05:05.410 --> 02:05:07.240
organizational legal methods.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:09.020
This is the development of a list of information

02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:10.800
constituting a commercial secret.

02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:13.800
This is the organization of a confidential

02:05:13.810 --> 02:05:15.900
document of turnover, a closed

02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:18.080
document of turnover, restriction

02:05:18.090 --> 02:05:20.800
of access of persons to the

02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:23.180
constituent commercial secret, various

02:05:23.190 --> 02:05:29.820
types of access control methods, and

02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:31.100
software-hardware or engineering-

02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:33.140
technical methods of protection

02:05:33.150 --> 02:05:36.740
of computer networks from unauthorized

02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:38.800
access and counteraction

02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:42.160
to technical intelligence.

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:45.400
In conclusion, I wanted to introduce

02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:51.000
you to the object security assessment

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:52.700
method, with the object security

02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:54.420
assessment method, the so-called

02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:57.040
Operation Security method.

02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.880
This method can be used in the analysis

02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:03.560
of any object of protection, ranging from

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.940
information, if we protect information

02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:08.960
and ending with the protection

02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:13.080
of the enterprise as a whole or

02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:15.560
a particular individual.

02:06:15.570 --> 02:06:20.360
This method was developed during

02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:23.220
the Vietnam War by Greek Americans

02:06:23.230 --> 02:06:24.880
under the tokos, and it is

02:06:24.890 --> 02:06:29.720
a method of estimating the cost

02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:36.000
of protective measures on

02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:39.500
the criteria of effective cost.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.260
It consists of seven stages, here are

02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:43.920
shown these seven stages.

02:06:43.930 --> 02:06:46.800
In the first phase, the state of the object

02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:49.080
of protection is analyzed.

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:52.200
We consider what system, we will

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.880
assess its initial level of

02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:56.720
protection.

02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.080
In the second phase, we assess threats,

02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:03.440
identify threats, link them to

02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:05.720
specific threat sources,

02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:08.220
assess the probability

02:07:08.230 --> 02:07:09.800
of these threats, assess

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.840
possible damage.

02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:16.120
Further, in the third phase, we evaluate

02:07:16.130 --> 02:07:19.260
the existing security system, we evaluate

02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:22.060
its effectiveness on the weakest

02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:25.080
link, that is, the evaluation

02:07:25.090 --> 02:07:27.120
of safety effectiveness goes

02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:28.880
on the weakest link.

02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:32.000
You may have a very good computer

02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:34.020
security system, access control system,

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.700
but the secretary of the director,

02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:40.600
therefore, has outputs to the

02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:43.900
opposing side, to your competitors,

02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:46.260
and the entire system, the

02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:48.960
expensive security system

02:07:48.970 --> 02:07:52.220
will not operate effectively.

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:55.920
In the third phase, we evaluate

02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:57.880
the effectiveness of the existing

02:07:57.890 --> 02:08:01.180
security system on the weakest

02:08:01.190 --> 02:08:02.060
link.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.560
We estimate that there may be a

02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:07.340
very good computer security system

02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:08.820
in the enterprise, there is

02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:10.900
an access control system, but

02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:14.460
the secretary of the director has

02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:18.820
contacts with competitors, and,

02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:21.100
in fact, the entire expensive

02:08:21.110 --> 02:08:23.300
security system, in general, will

02:08:23.310 --> 02:08:25.620
not perform its role.

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:27.980
Therefore, the analysis of the effectiveness

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:30.320
of the existing, I repeat, security subsystems

02:08:30.330 --> 02:08:33.000
is carried out taking into account all

02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.100
the factors of the security system.

02:08:36.110 --> 02:08:40.200
In the fourth phase, we determine

02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:42.920
the necessary additional security measures.

02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:44.840
That is, we see the full picture,

02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.760
we see the vulnerabilities and

02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:50.700
we see what additional funds need

02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:54.960
to be purchased and installed

02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:56.880
to improve efficiency.

02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.940
In the fifth phase, the proposals that

02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:03.200
were submitted in the fourth phase

02:09:03.210 --> 02:09:05.640
are considered and the cost of implementation

02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:08.240
of these proposals is estimated

02:09:08.250 --> 02:09:10.380
on the basis of the criterion

02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:11.520
of effective cost.

02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:15.340
At this stage, we estimate that

02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:20.320
it is cheaper for us to create

02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:21.340
some additional security

02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:24.220
system, or that information

02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.820
that may be lost, it is not

02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:27.920
worth that money.

02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:31.380
That is, here is a comparison on this

02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:32.560
criterion, on the criterion of

02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:34.660
effective cost, and in the sixth stage

02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:38.240
we are implementing measures.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:41.420
That is, at the sixth stage we

02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:44.380
are already starting to install some

02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:47.440
additional subsystems or some

02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:48.720
organizational methods to close

02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:51.460
access, if we are talking about

02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:53.300
information protection.

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.500
The seventh step is the monitoring

02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:58.600
of the implementation.

02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:02.460
This way we have ensured effective

02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:06.460
protection of the object, and this method

02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:10.080
is repeated either once a quarter

02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:12.720
or once every six months as

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:16.500
the objects of protection change,

02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:18.240
threats change.

02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:20.800
But we already have an effective

02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:23.140
security system, so in the next

02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:26.100
phases the costs will of

02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:27.760
course be much less.

02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:30.340
This method, the Operation Security

02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:32.400
method, is used quite successfully

02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:36.420
in assessing both foreign

02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:39.780
and Russian information protection

02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:41.960
facilities.

02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:53.090
This is where I end the introduction to

02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:55.650
the seminar, and at the end of the seminar

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:58.310
I would like to introduce

02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.010
you to the literature that complements

02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:05.370
the information you received during

02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:06.070
the seminar.

02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:09.910
First of all, the books of Vaschekhin,

02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:12.470
Dzliyev, Ursula – the safety of

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.130
entrepreneurial activity, the books

02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:17.470
of Oditsov – economic information

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.570
security, the book of Gruninych – the

02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:22.370

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.150
organization, my book – the technology

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.850
of business security, devoted primarily

02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:29.530
to competitive intelligence,

02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:31.270
and the book of Oleg Babits

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.130
– the experience of military

02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:37.670

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:38.630
commercial firm.

02:11:38.970 --> 02:11:42.170
In general, literature on this issue

02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.250
is currently released a lot,

02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:46.190
but, unfortunately, it is released

02:11:46.570 --> 02:11:48.730
in very small volumes, and

02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:52.250
it is not always possible to purchase it.

02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:55.450

02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:58.470

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.930
knowledge you gained during the

02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:05.670
interrogation will help you to

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.170
set up your security system and minimize

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:11.530
the threats that are inherent

02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:14.390
in your business.
