00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
My name is Andrey Eldimenov. I am a consultant in the Department of Management and Financial Planning.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Today we are discussing the topic of the Department of Finance, the capital of a company and its ways of formation.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
As for my personal biography, I would like to note that for 15 years I have been engaged in the practice of financial planning.

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
I have also been appointed as an accountant, as well as a director of finance and a general director of a large jewelry company.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
We will discuss three topics.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
The first topic is about the sources of finance, where we will give a description of the company's finances,

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
its main functions and the purpose of the organization's finances for the economy.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
The second topic will be about the price of financial resources, as money is also a commodity.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
At the same time, we are clients of such money providers as banks, financial companies and investment organizations.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
We use borrowed money for the development of our business.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
The third topic is about the market of money, which is the current market.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
We will discuss how to make the most of this market.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
The main purpose of this discussion is to give a methodological explanation of the way of formation

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
and how to manage the capital of an enterprise.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
On the other hand, we are interested in the practical aspects,

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
what good and positive methodologies and practical skills exist in managers of Russian and Western companies today,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
how this can be used in your own business or in your own work practice.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
The first topic.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
It is necessary to note that the capital of a company is the total cost of the funds in the monetary, material and non-material forms,

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
which are invested in the formation of assets in an enterprise.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Any business starts with the starting capital.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
No matter whether the company is established from scratch or is a subject of allocation to a subsidiary structure of some amount of assets,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
which were previously used by the parent company effectively or not.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
We assume that the allocated investments are, of course, oriented towards multiplication.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
The owners are supposed to get an additional pure cash flow,

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
which will be able to increase the value of the assets in the material and non-material forms.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
And, accordingly, increasing the value of the business, increasing the pure cash flow through the profit,

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
the shareholders perform the tasks set before the general meeting of the shareholders

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
and are satisfied with the investment investments that were made in the business of a particular enterprise.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
It is also necessary to note a very important point.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
As for the capital of the company, we say that the main and most acceptable source of financing of any business is pure profit.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
But, in addition, if the company has the opportunity to use a favorable external environment,

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
that is, when there is an opportunity to promote a product or some kind of service that is competitive and attractive for customers,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
it is necessary to develop very quickly and extensively.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Without this growth, it is impossible to take the leading market position in the market.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
And, as President General Electric Jack Welch said,

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
you can be either the first or the second in the market, or nothing.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Accordingly, those companies that, due to certain restrictions,

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
let's say, the same shareholders do not use the borrowed capital in their development,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
can lose their positions.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Accordingly, the impact of competitors can be compared with the spread of gas in the free space.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
That is, competitors will take all the free spaces,

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
and subsequently the slowdown caused by the insufficient amount of the company's capital,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
so that it is possible to develop effectively and extensively, will play a bad joke.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
That is, when the company will be forced to compete with the external conditions of the market,

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
favorable conditions from the side of competitors.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
And the competition will certainly affect the profit that the company gets and should get.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Accordingly, the profit itself may be more problematic.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
We can conclude that the capital should always act effectively

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
and focus on satisfying the needs of the payment-capable clients on the one hand,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
and the company should never experience restrictions in the capital

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
when forming its development strategy on the other hand,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
if there are really favorable conditions.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
The slide shows the characteristics of the company's capital.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
The following main characteristics can be highlighted.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Capital is the main factor of production.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
It is impossible to make a business work if we do not have enough capital.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
In the practice of finance, there is a term called the threshold of entering the business.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
It means that the business company should have a certain reserve or a certain starting volume of capital investments,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
which will allow to form the infrastructure for the business,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
which will allow to give the business turnover capital,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
as regards the stocks, as regards the interaction with clients and client debt,

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
as regards cash and cashless money, which should be at the company's disposal.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
All these assets require a certain amount of capital.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
The capital can be formed only from two sources.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
The first is the capital of the shareholders,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
and the second is the capital of the company's debt.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
The second is the capital of the company's debt,

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
which the company can attract in the external environment,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
using the services of banks, investment and financial companies,

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
imitating its own debt obligations in the form of VXLs or corporate bonds.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
It is also possible to increase the capital through the emission of shares.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
In this case, the shareholders should make the decision.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
However, production is impossible without capital.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
The stage of product formation is impossible.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
If a company does not have production, it does not have a product.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
If a company does not have a product, it cannot sell anything.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
That is, the business cannot exist.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Therefore, capital is the main factor of production.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
This is certainly necessary to take into account,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
especially in the financial planning.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Capital characterizes the financial resources of the company that bring income.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
Each shareholder will always strive to invest resources in those areas that give maximum income.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
He will welcome the offers and decisions of the management team,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
which will provide, on the one hand, a minimum amount of investment,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
and on the other hand, the maximum amount of return on investment.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Accordingly, capital will be multiplied with minimal investments.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
This is the most acceptable or desirable field for shareholders of companies

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
who strive to develop this business.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
If a shareholder invests resources in the projects offered by a manager with such requirements,

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
they are also oriented to such a criterion as time.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
That is, the shareholders are interested in the fact that with minimal investments

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
and maximum income on invested capital,

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
the business could still provide such results for a long time.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
That is, investments are necessary to support the development and preservation of the result,

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
in the form of net profit or net cash flow, which are the result of the company's activities.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
The third and important element of the general characteristics of the company's capital

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
is that capital is the main source of the well-being of its owners.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Net profit as a result of the company's activities is, in a balanced account,

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
for any entrepreneur, a part of his own capital,

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
or the result of the additional value to the total value of the company,

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
which was received by the managers of the company, who manage and operate the company's assets.

10:08.000 --> 10:16.000
The well-being of the shareholders is assessed not only in the format of the dividends they receive,

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
that is, as an element of net profit distribution,

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
but also as an increase in the value of the company's business.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
We have been focusing more and more on the growth of the value of our business.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
The value of the business can increase due to external factors,

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
for example, the market situation is favorable for the industry in general.

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
Suppliers who work in a separate industry have an increasing demand for the produced product,

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
and at the same time there is an increase in the price of this product.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
If we consider hydrocarbons, then for the last seven years,

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
the suppliers of hydrocarbons have felt the market conditions as favorable as possible.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
And, of course, it is thanks to this element of the well-being of shareholders of hydrocarbons companies

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
that the recycling of hydrocarbons is being carried out.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
The well-being of shareholders is sharply increasing compared to the period when the market price for oil was about $13 per barrel.

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
The increase in prices has been favorable for the pure money flow and net profit that the company receives,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
and at the same time the increase in the value of shares,

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
and therefore the value of the entire volume of oil companies' assets.

11:54.000 --> 12:04.000
The next element of the characteristics of the company's capital is that the company's capital is the main measurer of its market value.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
If we consider the offer to buy or prepare an offer to sell our business,

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
then the most understandable for both the buyer and the seller of our assets,

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
or for the independent assessor who, on the order of either the buyer or the seller of the assets,

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
forms a commercial offer, will be the monetary assessment.

12:34.000 --> 12:42.000
The amount of capital that is formed from the established capital of our shareholders,

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
which was allocated at the initial stage of the business formation,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
the volume of resources for its development,

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
the additional capital as a re-assessment of our assets,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
primarily in terms of non-returnable assets,

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
the main funds, perhaps land that is available to the company,

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
non-material assets, long-term financial investments, and other businesses.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
In addition, the net profit that the company received in the previous period,

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
that is, in the past years, and in the current period,

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
all these three main components are the components of the company's own capital.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Depending on the dynamics of its changes,

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
that is, if in the declared analytical documentation

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
a potential buyer or a potential seller who is going to sell his own assets

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
sees the corresponding dynamics, it is calculated in the money equivalent,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
in addition, the time criteria are assigned,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
and the rate of growth of the company's own capital can be assessed.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
This indicator primarily affects the value that can be determined for this business.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
The next element of the characteristics of the company's capital

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
is that the dynamics of the company's capital are the most important barometers

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
of the efficiency and economic activity.

14:24.000 --> 14:32.000
That is, if we imagine net profit as a logical subtraction from the volume of revenue

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
from the implementation that is at the disposal of the company,

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
then we can say that we have received net profit.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
At the same time, we say that the revenue from the implementation

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
is a favorable interaction with the company's customers,

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
it is a kind of parity or agreement when the price, quality and service

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
that our company offers in terms of products and service procedures.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
On the other hand, the costs that the company has at its disposal

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
are primarily the consequences of management decisions that the company's manager makes.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
That is, any management decision is essentially costly.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
As soon as the manager makes a decision, the company immediately starts spending money,

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
at least in the format of the fund for the payment of labor of the manager himself,

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
his subordinates, and the time that is necessary to make a decision

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
and achieve a certain result.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
That is, net profit is a consequence of the efficiency of the manager's company,

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
which is represented by the hired managers.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
If the company or team works effectively,

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
then the minimum level of costs will provide the maximum net profit for the company.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
The dynamics of the company's capital show the efficiency of management.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Perhaps there are no quality characteristics,

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
but at the same time, an analyst who considers the statistics and indicators of the company's capital

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
in terms of both its own capital and the borrowed capital

16:27.000 --> 16:37.000
can determine the quality or global efficiency of the company's management.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
A few words about the principles of the company's capital formation.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
The slide shows five basic principles that can be noted.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
First of all, the perspective of the company's economic activity.

16:53.000 --> 17:03.000
In this case, we say that capital is always effective if the company develops extensively.

17:03.000 --> 17:13.000
That is, additional capital investment allows you to develop the company extensively quickly and at the same time effectively.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
It allows you to open new branches, build additional production sites,

17:18.000 --> 17:30.000
hire additional qualified staff who can manage the company's economic processes more efficiently.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
At the same time, we say that if the company falls into a stagnation zone,

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
a market situation in terms of effective demand for payment is unstable,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
when the company predicts a market stagnation,

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
and perhaps a crisis that is expressed in the reduction of the customer's purchasing activity.

17:53.000 --> 18:04.000
At the same time, it is expressed as a desire for the customer to reduce the price of the products purchased from our company.

18:04.000 --> 18:16.000
At the same time, it is expressed as a desire or a demand to reduce the volume due to the lack of investment funds from our clients.

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
If we issue the main funds, we will assume that they are some kind of equipment.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Or it concerns the issuance of software.

18:26.000 --> 18:36.000
When companies that are related to our clients are negatively treated by additional capital investment,

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
it will affect us as producers of the corresponding products.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
At the same time, the remaining clients who still use the investment resources available at their disposal

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
will claim to reduce the price.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
In the event of a stagnation, we, as a prospect of further development,

19:00.000 --> 19:10.000
plan to wait out or survive the crisis and focus all our managerial efforts on saving our capital.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
The saving of capital, provided that the revenue is reduced from the implementation,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
is possible only by effectively managing the costs.

19:18.000 --> 19:29.000
We must reduce the costs of maintaining our business and the costs related to the main production or technological processes of our company.

19:29.000 --> 19:38.000
In this case, we consider the saving of capital as a prospect.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
At the same time, from a strategic point of view, if our company, as one of the elements of the development strategy,

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
considers operations to absorb competitors on the market,

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
through financial procurement or through the unification of assets,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
we must take into account a very important point.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
It is in the conditions of the crisis that our competitors are worth as little as possible.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
If we have the opportunity to attract additional volume of borrowed capital in the event of a crisis,

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
which can be both the merit of the managers themselves and the participation of the shareholders,

20:19.000 --> 20:28.000
then in this case, in the event of a crisis, we can purchase or absorb our competitors with minimal costs.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
In the conditions of the market, all players of the market,

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
due to the increase and growth in the dynamics of their own capital,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
will be worth as much as possible.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
In the context of the crisis, we can use two methods.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
The first method is to save our capital by optimizing costs and reducing costs.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
The second is to increase investment activity.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
When there is capital in stock plus the borrowed capital we attract,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
we direct it to the purchase of our competitors.

21:08.000 --> 21:20.000
Again, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that only if there is such an element in our development strategy,

21:20.000 --> 21:29.000
when we consider options and offers to buy our competitors, then this method can also work.

21:29.000 --> 21:39.000
The second principle is to ensure the balance of the volume of the capital attracted to the volume of the assets formed by the enterprise.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
In this case, we are talking about the fact that shareholders can set tasks

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
regarding the profitability of the company's activities.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
The task is not considered as a rigid dogma,

21:54.000 --> 22:08.000
the task is considered as a sense or parity on the part of the shareholders to participate in a business that has a certain share or a certain percentage of profitability.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
In this case, if the profitability of the current activity does not meet the expectations of the shareholders,

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
the shareholders do not want or do not strive to develop such a business.

22:20.000 --> 22:29.000
When we talk about the principle of ensuring the balance between the volume of the capital attracted to the volume of the assets formed by the enterprise,

22:29.000 --> 22:41.000
we mean the situation when the starting capital is allocated and at the same time there is a task on profitability of the activity.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
This means that after a certain period of time, usually after one calendar year,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
it will be possible to measure the actual balance of the company

22:51.000 --> 23:02.000
and determine the amount of assets or property that the company has at its disposal due to reinvested net profit.

23:02.000 --> 23:13.000
The second point within the framework of this principle from the shareholders can be a restriction on attracting borrowed capital.

23:13.000 --> 23:22.000
When a company is experiencing certain risks in the direction of financial stability,

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
financial stability is primarily the ratio of the own capital that is at the disposal of the company and borrowed capital,

23:30.000 --> 23:40.000
which concerns primarily bank loans and loans, which the company takes externally to support its own development,

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
to increase the volume of production, respectively, the volume of revenue from the implementation.

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
Shareholders can limit the management of the company to certain frames or standards,

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
which are expressed primarily in the ratio of their own and borrowed capital.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
In the case when we say that additional resources are necessary,

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
we claim that loans are needed, we claim that they are less than borrowed capital,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
for example, in the board of directors' office or in the analytical note,

24:14.000 --> 24:24.000
we lose certain prospects and advantages that we could get in the future only due to the limitation of standards.

24:24.000 --> 24:34.000
Often, from the shareholders' point of view, there is a formalized reaction that the standards are established,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
and in the case when you really have the opportunity to develop effectively,

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
you need to start working with the company's turnover capital,

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
that is, with regard to the optimization of the reserves at the disposal of the company,

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
which is also formed at the expense of its own capital and borrowed capital,

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
it concerns the stock of raw materials or goods for re-sales,

24:58.000 --> 25:06.000
it concerns the volume of unfinished production, if we consider the industrial or production sphere,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
it also concerns the management of the debitory debt,

25:09.000 --> 25:21.000
when the temporary seizure or transition from working with clients to relations related to receiving preliminary payment

25:21.000 --> 25:30.000
for pre-loaded products or services will increase the speed of money circulation,

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
and therefore, in a smaller volume, from the point of view of interest rate,

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
you can get a return on the invested capital, that is, a profit from the current activity.

25:40.000 --> 25:49.000
And it is the optimization of the capital structure from the point of view of the volume of assets in the company

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
that is also one of the main principles.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
The third principle is to provide the optimality of the capital structure from the point of view of its effective functioning.

25:59.000 --> 26:10.000
I mean that the capital should be exactly as much as is required for the most effective activity.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
There are many examples of centralization and decentralization related to organizational procedures.

26:18.000 --> 26:31.000
In case of a large unifying structure, it will certainly require a large amount of capital investments,

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
it reaches the maximum level of efficiency within the current activity,

26:35.000 --> 26:43.000
and the maximum efficiency within the current activity can be assessed based on the indicators of pure profitability of sales,

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
that is, when the pure profitability of sales begins to decrease from time to time,

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
and this certainly occurs only in terms of changes in the greater part of the costs that are at the company's disposal,

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
that is, when the costs grow at a higher and faster pace than the pace of growth in the revenue from the implementation.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
It can be decided to stop the growth of assets that are at the company's disposal,

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
that is, the property complex, to stop hiring personnel in the main company,

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
and to take measures to decentralize or distribute assets,

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
when through the allocation of individual or subsidiary companies,

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
or companies with shares in the share capital of both the parent company and the partners,

27:37.000 --> 27:47.000
attempts are made to reduce the overall cost of consolidated accounting of the group,

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
and this is primarily related to the efficiency of the group and the company as a whole.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
I think it is also necessary to note a very important point.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.000
In the context of the crisis, we observe in almost all industries and companies,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
that the methods are related to decentralization,

28:11.000 --> 28:20.000
that is, when companies, trying to maintain the parameters or planned parameters for the efficiency of their activities,

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
allocate individual blocks of the property complex in the subsidiary company

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
in accordance with the amount of costs that the company has,

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
the amount of revenues, as well as the revenue from the implementation that is at the company's disposal.

28:38.000 --> 28:45.000
But, of course, from an organizational point of view, assets are not allocated as uncontrollable missiles,

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
that is, subsidiary companies support the development and implementation of the company's strategy

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
and in no case act as uncontrollable missiles.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
In the conditions of market growth, in the conditions of a favorable situation, the opposite is the case.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
That is, a decentralized structure, representing a group of companies,

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
begins to unite either into a single holding structure,

29:11.000 --> 29:20.000
there are many examples of this, when a statement is made in the media about the transition to one share of a particular group of companies.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
The explanation is very simple.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
This is due to the increase in the efficiency of the company's functioning,

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
when the overall volume of revenue from the implementation of the holding grows,

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
when there is an opportunity to exclude duplicate functions from the management system,

29:36.000 --> 29:46.000
that is, the volume of costs will grow at a slower pace than the volume of revenue from the implementation.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
In the case when the volume of revenue from the implementation grows at a higher pace,

29:51.000 --> 30:01.000
this is the first sign that the capital that is at the company's disposal is being exploited or used with maximum efficiency

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
and in an orderly manner, better than in the past period of time.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
The fourth principle is to ensure the minimization of costs in the formation of capital from various sources.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
This is the so-called diversification of loans,

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
and it is related to the capital itself.

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
If we consider the largest in terms of capital and value of a company in the world,

30:29.000 --> 30:37.000
such as ExxonMobil, which today costs about $500 billion,

30:37.000 --> 30:50.000
there is confirmed information that about 99.5% of shares are traded in the free market.

30:51.000 --> 30:58.000
It is clear that there are key shareholders who hold large shares,

30:58.000 --> 31:05.000
but at the same time there are a huge number of private shareholders

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
or small minority shareholders who hold the securities of this company.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
First of all, they are guided by the growth of the company's value and capital,

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
primarily in terms of money, due to the net profit.

31:23.000 --> 31:32.000
All shareholders make attempts, including ExxonMobil, to diversify the capital.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
This is when we talk about the share emission of the parent company,

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
when we talk about the increase in the share emission of the territorial units.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
As for the loan capital, when a company considers the possibility of working not with a single strategic partner,

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
but with a bank that is part of the group of companies,

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
it is guided by diversification of loans related to the value of money,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
related to the term of the loan,

32:07.000 --> 32:15.000
related to the possibility of setting certain limits or the size of the loan lines in a bank.

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
Thus, the company's loan portfolio can be a certain segmentation,

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
when we can work with three, five or more banks that serve our debts.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
This is due to the fact that we do not risk to manage the loan capital,

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
or, as they say, not to put all the eggs in one basket,

32:44.000 --> 32:54.000
and not to work with a single key partner on the front of the loan capital, with a single key bank.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
Any monopoly allows us to dictate the conditions, including if we work with one bank,

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
then all the issues are related to the change of the conditions of the loan agreements or agreements,

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
the conditions of the loan, the interest rate, the terms, the volumes.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
This is associated with certain difficulties.

33:15.000 --> 33:22.000
In order to avoid these difficulties, it is possible to use various sources of the loan capital.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
The fifth principle is to provide highly effective use of capital in the process of economic activity.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
We have already discussed this.

33:32.000 --> 33:39.000
The only indicator that indicates the effective use of capital is, first of all,

33:39.000 --> 33:47.000
the pure profitability of sales, and, secondly, the overall value of the company's business,

33:47.000 --> 33:57.000
which is mainly due to the increase and dynamics of changes in the greater part of the company's own capital.

33:57.000 --> 34:04.000
The next slide shows the systematization of the types of capital according to the main classification features.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
When a question arises about the practical significance of this classification,

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
we first of all say that, as shown in this slide,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
the company is trying to move from the general to the private sector,

34:18.000 --> 34:28.000
to the levers or to some elements, to some areas of capital management in the company.

34:28.000 --> 34:37.000
According to the company's affiliation, it allocates two large groups of capital, its own and borrowed capital.

34:37.000 --> 34:49.000
As for the purposes of use, the capital is the source of the company's non-returnable assets,

34:49.000 --> 34:57.000
which is primarily the main means of infrastructure for production processes.

34:57.000 --> 35:08.000
Capital is the basis for generating returns, which is sometimes called labor capital,

35:08.000 --> 35:15.000
or the return on the company's assets is the source of generating net profits.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
That is, it is through the return on the company's assets that any company finances its own current activity.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Capital is also the source of the company's capital.

35:26.000 --> 35:38.000
We use the ship's or borrowed capital to expand the company's activities.

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
If we have an inefficient management system to solve some current fire problems,

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
that is, when we are short of money, we use ship's capital to re-credit,

35:51.000 --> 35:58.000
wait for a certain period of time until more favorable conditions, primarily in business activity.

35:58.000 --> 36:05.000
Thus, we have the opportunity to solve these problems through a partner bank.

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
Speculative capital is a very important aspect.

36:13.000 --> 36:21.000
Many companies, including Russian ones, use speculative capital to regulate external debt.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
If we imitate our own VIX or our own bonds,

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
often companies can buy out their own bonds on the market.

36:32.000 --> 36:39.000
If, for example, the bonds are unfavorable or low-quality,

36:39.000 --> 36:48.000
and not interesting for the majority of the corporate debt holders,

36:48.000 --> 36:58.000
the company can act as a buyer of its own bonds and at the same time increase the market.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
That is, when there is a need to allocate free money, the company can sell its bonds.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
The same thing happens with the company's shares.

37:10.000 --> 37:17.000
Many companies buy their own shares while the market is decreasing.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
At the same time, they are the largest sellers of their own shares

37:21.000 --> 37:30.000
when the market share is increasing.

37:30.000 --> 37:42.000
This technique is often used when managers know the prospects of the company's financial results for the current period of time,

37:42.000 --> 37:52.000
and start preparing for a long period before the end of the financial year.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
After 9-12 months before the end of the year,

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
the company's shareholders start buying out shares of their own companies.

38:03.000 --> 38:11.000
After the declaration that we have received an increase in net profits,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
which is much higher than the official plans,

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
and the official plans are primarily related to the company's strategy of development,

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
the market will, of course, be revived by the value of the company's securities,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
and the shares will go up.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
At this point in time, the company sells its own shares.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
The next classification characteristic is the forms of capital investment.

38:38.000 --> 38:47.000
These are capital in financial form, capital in material form, and capital in non-material form.

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
All the above classification characteristics correspond to the formation of assets in the company,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
and, of course, have a monetary value.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
In the case where we consider the possibility of implementing a joint project with our new partners,

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
not only in monetary terms can capital be allocated to both sides,

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
but also in material and non-material terms.

39:16.000 --> 39:28.000
One of the examples of capital in non-material terms is the administrative regulation,

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
or the influence of the administrative process, or the so-called government regulation,

39:35.000 --> 39:45.000
when we use non-material assets of one or another country to coordinate issues with the authorities.

39:46.000 --> 39:54.000
Or when capital in non-material form can be represented by the trading brands that the company has at its disposal,

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
or other components that belong to the category of non-material assets,

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
which are also formed from our own and borrowed capital.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
The next classification characteristic is the forms of capital investment.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
In the case of non-material assets, capital is mainly directed to increase the main capital,

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
or non-material assets, and to increase the turnover capital,

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
or to form turnover funds.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
The forms of capital investment in the process of circulation.

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
The famous Marxist formula is money-goods-money-strikes,

40:40.000 --> 40:49.000
and the capital circulation gradation that exists in all industries was set.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
Capital can be in monetary form, in manufacturing form, and in commodity form.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
As for the first, second and third components,

41:01.000 --> 41:07.000
there is no way that the capital circulation will stop.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
If it does, we can say that the business has ceased to exist,

41:14.000 --> 41:25.000
and the absence of the circulation of capital does not mean the possibility of a rapid recovery of the speed of the circulation of capital.

41:26.000 --> 41:34.000
At the same time, the ceasing of the circulation of capital means the absence of a net profit for the company.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
The next slide shows the systematization of the types of capital according to the main classification characteristics.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
The forms of property distinguish private and public capital.

41:47.000 --> 41:56.000
Now this is becoming more relevant for Russian companies due to major projects related to private-state partnerships.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
When we say that state companies are the key investors in the national economy,

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
this is primarily due to the favorable global market conduct on hydrocarbon resources.

42:11.000 --> 42:20.000
Such companies as Rosneft and Gazprom are the largest players in the world and represent state capital.

42:21.000 --> 42:31.000
The budget of the country is filled with state capital from the participation of certain companies.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
At the same time, rapid growth of private capital is also increasing.

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
It is important to systematize the capital according to the forms of property,

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
namely, from the point of view of the consideration of joint projects,

42:48.000 --> 42:58.000
state participation and participation of private investors in large construction or city-forming or system-forming projects.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
The forms of activity differ according to the organizational and legal forms.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
The forms of activity differ according to the organizational and legal forms.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.000
This is the capital of open-sourced companies,

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
the capital of open-sourced companies,

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
the capital of private individuals.

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
The form of capital used in the production process is working capital, not dead capital.

43:30.000 --> 43:40.000
Working capital is primarily related to the sources of the formation of the main means of enterprise,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
which are in constant operation,

43:43.000 --> 43:49.000
that is, the machine park used to implement the production program of companies.

43:49.000 --> 43:56.000
Working capital is also related to the formation of the turnover of the enterprise,

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
that is, everything related to raw materials, stock,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
the volume of unfinished production at the company's disposal,

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
the volume of the remaining goods, the finished products in the warehouse.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
Here is the debt of the debitor and the money at the company's disposal.

44:16.000 --> 44:23.000
Unworking dead capital is primarily related to non-returnable assets,

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
with production capacities that are not used by the company.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
This happens less often, but sometimes it happens,

44:32.000 --> 44:38.000
when the production of a non-returnable or non-commercial product is cut off.

44:38.000 --> 44:44.000
Companies are forced to do something with dead capital.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
It is necessary to look for buyers for this equipment,

44:48.000 --> 44:58.000
because it is extremely difficult to find a buyer for such equipment.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
The unenviable fate of the dead capital is waiting for it in the format of the main means,

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
that is, the transfer to the utile, that is, to the raw material, to the scrap metal, etc.

45:09.000 --> 45:15.000
Unworking dead capital exists in the turnover of the enterprise.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
As a rule, these are the remaining goods or non-liquid goods,

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
those that for some reason cannot be realized on the market,

45:23.000 --> 45:31.000
or those that were returned to customers in the format of an irreparable marriage.

45:31.000 --> 45:38.000
That is, the utile is also necessary, or the sale at extremely low prices is necessary,

45:38.000 --> 45:47.000
only in order to at least partially return the money for the dead turnover that we received.

45:47.000 --> 45:56.000
In the turnover, dead assets, which are called non-working dead capital,

45:56.000 --> 46:06.000
often arise from mistakes of marketing specialists and commercial specialists in the company.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
That is, when a demand was overestimated,

46:09.000 --> 46:19.000
or for some reason the cost of the product or service was unsuccessfully formed,

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
it turned out to be not competitive on the market, not in demand.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
That is, the client does not want to pay money for it.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
There is no way to find parity in price and quality,

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
and because of this, there is a certain amount of non-reducible, non-liquid,

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
or those assets in the turnover that, unfortunately, cannot be sold.

46:41.000 --> 46:48.000
In terms of the use of the owner, the consumable, or sometimes called the edible capital,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
is highlighted.

46:50.000 --> 47:02.000
If the decision is made to pay dividends and the shareholder does not send the received funds for reinvestment,

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
it can be considered that this is consumable capital.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
The accumulated, reinvested capital is the opposite situation.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
When the decision is made not to pay dividends,

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
but to send pure profit as a component of the own capital,

47:19.000 --> 47:26.000
to increase either the main capital or the turnover capital.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
That is, to send funds for acquisitions of non-turnover assets in the company,

47:30.000 --> 47:40.000
machines, equipment, perhaps new technologies, new software, computer technology, and other components.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
That is, everything that is connected with modernization and infrastructure maintenance in the working condition.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Or a decision is made to send pure profit to the company

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
to increase the volume of purchases of raw materials or goods for re-sale,

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
to increase market activity in terms of marketing activities,

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
BTL, shares, participation in exhibitions, advertising, and so on.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
The sources of attraction are national domestic capital,

48:13.000 --> 48:22.000
which is formed by Russian banks and sold in the form of loan agreements or supplied.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
Resources are supplied to enterprises.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
Accordingly, the national domestic capital has a certain value.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
Due to the fact that the inflationary impact in Russia is still slightly higher than in Europe,

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
the value of the national domestic capital is higher than the value of the Western capital.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
In addition, this is also related to the stability of the economy.

48:47.000 --> 48:54.000
The Russian economy has shown a steady growth for the last 5-6 years.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
This growth is due to long-term trends.

48:59.000 --> 49:10.000
So far, the market has not responded so responsibly to the increasing stability in the economy.

49:10.000 --> 49:23.000
Still, compared to the Western markets, the value of the domestic market is much higher than that of the foreign markets.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
The second category of sources of attraction is foreign capital.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
The value of the enterprise's capital.

49:30.000 --> 49:38.000
The slide shows the basis for the value of the enterprise's capital,

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
which the enterprise pays for its attraction from various sources.

49:44.000 --> 49:53.000
It is clear that the attraction is part of the search function of any enterprise.

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
If the company is purposefully looking for sources of capital,

49:59.000 --> 50:08.000
it is possible to get good results in terms of the value and quality of the capital it acquires.

50:08.000 --> 50:17.000
It is also possible to get good results in terms of the value of the enterprise's capital.

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
The main areas of use of the value of the enterprise's capital are highlighted.

50:23.000 --> 50:34.000
The first category is the measure of profitability of the enterprise's operations.

50:35.000 --> 50:44.000
The increase in the enterprise's own capital due to the net profit of the enterprise

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
can be assessed through the profitability of the enterprise's operations.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
That is, the intensity of the enterprise's net profit,

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
and how it affects the increase in the value of the enterprise's capital.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
The second category is the measure of the value of the enterprise's capital.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
It is used as a criterion for the implementation of real investment.

51:06.000 --> 51:15.000
If we say that we have diversified areas of activity,

51:15.000 --> 51:21.000
each of the areas of activity has certain prospects.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
For example, one of the managers is in charge of the key areas of activity,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
which have already reached the planned capacity,

51:30.000 --> 51:38.000
where the value of the enterprise's capital and the increase in the value due to the net profit

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
are already clear, the volume of the enterprise's capital,

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
the price of the enterprise's capital, the method of acquisition,

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
the time of use, or the constant basis,

51:51.000 --> 51:59.000
then we say that the enterprise can set certain criteria

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
that are the indicators of the value of the enterprise's capital in certain areas of activity.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
If the enterprise is not connected to the hard-line strategy,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
let's say that we are engaged in only one direction of business,

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
the adjacent one has the right to exist, but is oriented towards sales.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Sometimes companies use similar strategies.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
When we say that we are a diversified company,

52:29.000 --> 52:37.000
and we work more as an investment company,

52:37.000 --> 52:48.000
we invest in the areas of activity where the value of the enterprise's capital is the main criterion.

52:48.000 --> 52:58.000
If the value increases faster, if the value increases with the expected result for the shareholders,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
we invest in these areas.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
The value of the enterprise's capital is the basic indicator of the efficiency of financial investment.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
This is the third component.

53:09.000 --> 53:21.000
The value of the enterprise's capital is an indisputable and not discussed indicator

53:21.000 --> 53:28.000
that determines whether the company's resources are invested effectively or not.

53:29.000 --> 53:40.000
This is why it is enough to provide the company with a report on the state of the budget plan,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
the implementation of the budget plan,

53:42.000 --> 53:51.000
and the analysis of the financial results of the various areas of activity in our company,

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
the growth of the company's overall value and the contribution of certain areas to this value.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
The fourth component is the indicator of the value of the enterprise's capital.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
This is the criterion for making management decisions

54:05.000 --> 54:12.000
regarding the use of lease or leasehold property.

54:12.000 --> 54:19.000
This means that when we analyze what is more profitable for us,

54:19.000 --> 54:30.000
if we use leasing, then all payments on leasing are based on the reduction of the tax on the base of profit.

54:30.000 --> 54:37.000
If we consider the value of the company's own capital,

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
we say that the use of leasing technology contributes to the indicator of net profit.

54:45.000 --> 54:55.000
At the same time, it would be much higher if we did not use leasing technology or other means,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
but bought them through a bank loan.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
In this case, we would show a higher volume of operational profit for the company,

55:04.000 --> 55:12.000
and at the same time, by sacrificing the tax rate for the profit of 24%,

55:12.000 --> 55:21.000
we would show a higher effect or a higher volume of return on the invested capital through the indicator of net profit.

55:21.000 --> 55:30.000
And depending on what the financial strategy of our company is primarily oriented to,

55:30.000 --> 55:37.000
it is primarily oriented to the effectiveness of the current activity and business activity,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
when we need to form an infrastructure,

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
when we are oriented to the fact that only in three years we will start to provide information

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
about the effectiveness of our business in the external environment,

55:49.000 --> 55:58.000
to provide information about the preparation of bonds or IPO with our own corporate securities,

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
then leasing is useful in this period of time.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
In this case, if we act as a public company, which has a market image,

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
we are certainly oriented to not use leasing schemes,

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
but to focus more on attracting borrowed capital and through loans,

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
purchase of equipment or the main means of obtaining their property,

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
we put them on the balance, increasing the size of non-returnable assets,

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
and we start to exploit them with less costs,

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
since there are no leasing payments, there is only a long service,

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
and at the same time, the entire volume of revenue from the implementation

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
of the new capitalization shows an increase in business activity,

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
while at the same time, there is less cost in the service of this business activity.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
The fifth component is the capital cost indicator,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
in the category of its individual elements,

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
is used in the process of managing the structure of this capital

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
based on the mechanism of the financial lever.

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
This is just one of the elements of the efficiency of managing capital in the company,

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
which is directly dealt with by the financial manager,

57:20.000 --> 57:26.000
is the ratio of the own capital and the borrowed capital that the company uses.

57:26.000 --> 57:33.000
The essence of the financial lever is that if the company,

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
with less costs related to the service of the debt,

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
receives more net profit due to the exploitation of the attracted capital,

57:44.000 --> 57:51.000
and the market situation allows to increase the volume of revenue from the implementation,

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
and, accordingly, to increase the volume of the production of products or services,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
then the effect of the financial lever will be achieved.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
Or the opposite situation, when the service of the debt is more in terms of costs

58:09.000 --> 58:15.000
than the effect of the business activity that the company receives in the form of net profit,

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
then the effect of the financial lever does not work,

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
and, of course, the main emphasis or the main focus of the activities

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
of the financial manager is on the management of the own capital.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
When, due to the optimization of the turnover,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
when, due to the reduction of costs,

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
we are looking for reserves for more effective exploitation of the company's own capital.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
The next slide shows the statements on the value of the company's capital.

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
The level of the capital's value is the most important indicator of the market value.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
The indicator of the capital's value is the criteria for assessing

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
and forming the appropriate type of policy of financing of the company's assets,

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
first of all, of course, of the turnover assets.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
The financial manager, considering the management of the company's assets,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
the management of the company's assets,

59:21.000 --> 59:27.000
is primarily focused on the adequacy or balance of the company's own and borrowed capital,

59:27.000 --> 59:33.000
since the amount of assets, both of their own and of the borrower's own,

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
affects financial stability and the risks associated with financial stability,

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
since the borrower's capital must be serviced.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
And the second indicator is the efficiency of the operation.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
When the borrower's capital is used as an additional investment,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
as an additional increase of the company's turnover assets,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
the financial manager is trying to compensate for the costs of the service of the borrower's capital

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and to increase the turnover assets at the disposal of the company

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
by means of the net profit obtained from the operation of the borrower's capital.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The next slide shows the three main factors affecting the market value of the company's capital.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
The managers, having the task of increasing the business value,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
are primarily trying to generate the current profit in the amount sufficient for the payment of dividends and reinvestment.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It often happens that the shareholders set the task to achieve the state of the company's capital,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
when the company is able to reinvest the net profit into the current business

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and to close the entire investment budget with its own efforts.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
At the same time, there are not many such cases in practice.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The main limitation is, of course, the competitive influence.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
If the market value of the company is not enough, many companies are trying to repeat their success.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
At the moment, limited companies can only implement their strategy by reinvesting their own profits.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Additional sources of financing are also necessary, primarily in the form of borrower's capital.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The second major factor affecting the market value of any company's capital

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
is, of course, the minimization of the risk of activity and structure of the source of funds.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
We have already discussed the ratio of the company's own capital and borrower's capital,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
the management of the borrower's capital, the ability of the company to extend the time of the event

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
of the cancellation of a particular credit tranche,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000
the risk of cash outages, because one loan has to be paid, and the other has not yet been received.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
All this is a risk zone for the company's financial mechanism.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The art of the financial director is to minimize the risks of the company's activity as a whole

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and to reduce the dependence on the structure of the source of funds that the company has.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
In the case of a fight for the reduction of costs,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
everything looks great in terms of tactics, for example, within the framework of one calendar year.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
The company pays out loans, pays out interest,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and the company pays out interest.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
According to the results of the work over the year,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
if we did not reduce the size of the loan portfolio,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
the amount of interest would be 5 million dollars per year.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000
If we did not reduce the size of the loan portfolio,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
the amount of interest would be 3 million dollars per year.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
It seems that there is 2 million dollars of savings,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
which is certainly a positive result, but from the point of view of the tactical moment.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
With the beginning of the new financial year, January 2, 2008,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
a problem suddenly arises, due to the fact that the company urgently needs additional loans

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
for the extensive growth of the company,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
including the opening of a new branch or a new production site.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The debt market, on which we work as a client,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000
is not ready to allocate the necessary amount of resources quickly and in one day.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The meeting of the credit committee in banks usually takes place twice a month.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
At the same time, without the decision of the credit committee,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
the company has to pay a certain amount of money.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
The task of the financial director is to balance the policy,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
not only to reduce costs, but also to ensure the continuity of activities

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and not to allow cash outages due to the lack of the necessary amount of debt.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:19.000
The task is difficult, but the financial director must think in terms of more or more than one financial year.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The third component of the market value of capital, the most important,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
the most key and the most basic, is the attraction of experienced management staff.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It is important to note that the financial and economic services of any company,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
including accounting services, are responsible for the efficiency of distribution.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Everything that concerns the economy, everything that concerns the turnover,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
but in no case can these services affect the business activity of the company.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000
The most difficult function from a financial point of view is the sale function.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Sales are supported by a sufficient flow of money,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
which means that the volume of the load in the corresponding plan indicators

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
is simultaneously leveled with the price for the goods or services provided by the company,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
which would allow to compensate for the company's expenses and ensure the desired level of profitability of the current activity.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Of course, only experienced management staff can cope with this,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
not only in the field of finance, but also in the field of commercial activities of any enterprise,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
including marketing activities.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
The market value of the company's capital is mediated, high-quality,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
but the most important is the influence of experienced management staff.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The absence of experienced management staff as one of the elements

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
or as one of the results of the ineffective struggle against costs,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
when we start to squeeze out expensive specialists,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
is due to the fact that the company works with good financial indicators for a certain period of time,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and this inertia usually lasts from 3 to 6 months,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
and then there is a sharp decline,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
which is due to the fact that experienced management staff left the company,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and the remaining staff simply do not have organizational and professional experience

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
that the previous staff had.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
There is no continuity of staff,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
but maybe in 3-6 months we have fulfilled the task in an unthinkable policy of reducing costs

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and reduced the total wage of the staff by several percent.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
At the same time, the risks that the company is taking due to such events are incomparably higher,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
which can be equated with financial losses,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
which are incomparably higher than the losses on the wage fund.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
The next slide shows the process of creating the company's capital value.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
We say that the implementation of successful financial alternative solutions

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
is the main driving force in the process of creating the company's capital value.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
In this case, the financial and economic services of the company

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
are more like a creative and creative group.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
In this case, if the company is oriented towards extensive growth,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
the financial and economic functions of the company in regulating internal processes

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
begin to take a dominant position.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
If the company is developing within the existing infrastructure,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
there is no need for extensive growth,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000
then the role of financial and economic services begins to resemble accounting services.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And accounting effectively works in the case

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
when the entire volume of operations is reflected in a timely, correct and accurate volume.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Many company managers begin to limit financial and economic services,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
to bring them to the common denominator,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
to try to reduce the number of financial and economic services,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and to carry out other measures to optimize costs for these services.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
But as soon as there is a problem related to extensive growth,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
with the increase of the centers of responsibility,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
with the emergence of new branches,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
with the emergence of new organizational units in the company's organizational structures,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
we begin to understand that the lack or insufficient level of qualifications

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
of financial and economic services specialists can cause great damage or cause great loss for the company.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
That is, you need to get current management, there is no personnel.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And that is why, of course, within the framework of capital management

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and within the framework of the prospects of the growth of the company's market value,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
we are guided by unconditional growth,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
but at the same time we claim that in this case it is impossible to save on personnel.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
This also applies to the creative part of the business,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
as far as the performance indicators of the company's sales and marketing functions are concerned.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
This also applies to the distribution functions of the company,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
for which financial and economic services are responsible.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So, the scheme is designed to have on the one hand,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000
to allow the system of choice and the making of reasonable investments of resources to function effectively.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
They are certainly determined within the framework of the strategy of the company by the shareholders,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and at the same time the manager forms an investment budget for the implementation of this strategy.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000
There should be a choice and careful use of funding sources.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Here, the responsibility zone shifts to the tactical level,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and financial and economic services are just conducting a policy of diversification of resources related to the borrowing market,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
conducting measures to minimize the cost of these resources,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000
conducting measures to restructure the credit portfolio from the point of view of the service banks,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and increasing the number of banks,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
from the point of view of the distribution of financial flows and the possibility of trading,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
if we can say so, or receiving more preferences from banks.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:37.000
But at the same time, to fulfill one's own obligations to serve the debts that the company has at its disposal.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
The third element of the creation of the value of capital of the enterprise is, of course,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
the use of resources to conduct competitive, effective activity.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:57.000
These three blocks are the elements of the creation of a reasonable market value of capital.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Very often there is a situation in the market that some of the competitors sell extremely successfully,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
and aggressively enter new markets, attract new clients,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:22.000
but at the same time, a short period of time that can change in a year or two can take the leading position.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But behind them, let's say, the second in the echelon are those companies that have very effective methods of managing capital,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:42.000
those who creatively and without risk relate to the sources of financing their activities,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and these companies choose the client mass of yesterday's leaders,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000
giving more effective offers on prices, payment conditions, service,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000
and the clients, of course, choose what is more profitable to them in terms of price, quality and service.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Therefore, the account for the prospects of the three blocks of creating the value of capital of the enterprise

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
within the framework of the financial and economic policy of any company is extremely important.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
The next slide shows the structure of the company's own capital.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The structure of the company's own capital consists of five components.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Three of them are the key ones we discussed.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:36.000
These are the established capital, the additional capital that is formed from overestimating the company's non-returnable and returnable assets, and net profit.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.000
In addition, the structure of the company's own capital can be divided into social and target financial funds,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
which are also filled with net profit that the company receives.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:58.000
The so-called reserve funds or reserve capital can be formed on possible negative conditions.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000
As for the negative events that can be predicted or that cannot be predicted but can arise,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000
or the so-called force majeure conditions, in the event of a loss of a part of the property complex,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
reserve funds may be required to restore it.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Losses can be associated with natural disasters or, say, with the safety of individual production processes.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000
In addition, reserve funds are often used to interact with insurance companies,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
which receive insurance payments from the company's reserve funds,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:50.000
while simultaneously guaranteeing the company's uninterrupted functioning or a minimum loss in the event of force majeure conditions.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:59.000
In addition, there are other forms of capital that can be expressed in various forms.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:10.000
For example, the case of mutual assistance, which is an effective and, let's say, grateful old legacy of the Soviet economy.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:20.000
These can be various internal funds in the company, which have a target direction for both consumption and accumulation.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000
These can be stipulated funds for young employees, NewOCR funds, and other components.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
The sources of the formation of our own financial resources are presented in the following slide.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
There is a global classification of internal and external sources.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We say that the company's own capital is formed from within at the expense of the profits left at the company's disposal.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000
In addition, there is amortization deduction from the main funds and non-material assets used.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I would like to note the following.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.000
In the West, amortization deduction is the main source of investment.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:19.000
From 45% to 50%, on average, according to experts, all investments in the West are made through amortization.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
We can give an example.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:39.000
If we consider the Italian textile industry, entrepreneurs working in the production sector have a 100% chance to amortize their equipment within a year.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:56.000
This is provided that the funds saved at the expense of the reduction of the tax base on the profit, which is the reason for the formation of the amortization fund, will be used to purchase new equipment.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Italians are certainly the leaders in the production of textile equipment.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000
At the same time, entrepreneurs who are growing their companies are also leading the way.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
They are aggressively increasing the production of new products, including new types of fabrics.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
They are striving to modernize the equipment fleet.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The question is what is happening to the equipment that has been amortized.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
An entrepreneur is paying for the equipment that has been purchased.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.000
With the support of Italian banks, the equipment is transported to Pakistan, India and China through leasing schemes.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The equipment is operated there for 3-5 years.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It is clear that the level of operation and wear is at its maximum.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:03.000
After that, the equipment, which is practically worthless, costs a limited amount or has a limited price, is sent to Russia.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It is not reasonable to say that Russian textile companies can carry out the modernization of their fleet.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It is reasonable, because it is impossible to produce a competitive product that can be exported for one simple reason.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The current level of repairs and the influence of this volume on the cost will not allow to give a competitive price to the corresponding goods on the foreign markets.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Amortization payments should be accumulated in any company and should not go to so-called consumption funds.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Very often, companies pay less taxes for their profits, and the saved part of the resources is spent on hidden consumption.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The modernization of the infrastructure and the acquisition of new non-returnable assets does not happen.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Other internal sources of the formation of their own financial resources are also included as a third component of the internal sources of the formation of capital in the company.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
External sources.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
External sources are certainly related to the attraction of additional combat or shareholder capital.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000
When a decision is made by shareholders or founders to increase the established capital,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:40.000
and there is an increase in shares or the amount of shares purchased at a certain nominal, additionally imitated,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and due to this the company receives external sources of capital increase.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000
The acquisition of a company of non-returnable financial assistance is usually considered within the framework of holding structures,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
usually at the starting stage.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Other external sources of the formation of the company's own financial resources.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000
The next slide shows the classifier of the sources of the formation of borrowed financial resources.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
In this case, there is a distinction between long-term and short-term sources.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:25.000
In terms of long-term borrowed capital and financial obligations, loans are issued,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
the term of which has not yet come, and usually the term is more than a year.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:48.000
In addition to loans, there can be long-term loans provided by or in the form of loans from players in the financial market,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.000
when there are specialized companies that pay in the form of loans.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Sometimes these companies issue VXLs, which are loans that require long-term loans,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
and the term of VXL cancellation can be more than a year.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
A negative component can be in a company when long-term loans and loans are not temporarily canceled.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.000
At the same time, it can be considered that these loans are temporary,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and are also a component of long-term loans and loans provided by the company.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Short-term borrowed capital is also formed from loans, banks and loans.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.000
At the same time, it is possible that there is a temporary short-term loan and loan debt,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
but here we should make a comment in connection with the start of the work of the credit bureau.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Companies began to be very careful and very effective in canceling their own debt obligations.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:10.000
This applies to interest payments and to the cancellation of the main loans.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
This is due to the fact that information is sent to a centralized database,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and in the event of subsequent transfer to other banks, the company may be denied loans

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
due to violations of the obligations to cancel loans and loans.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
One of the sources of short-term borrowed capital can be a credit debt,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000
primarily to our suppliers, when we can receive a so-called commodity loan.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000
This is a supply of goods with the terms of payment in installments,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:58.000
both annuity payments, equal parts, and cash payments for a certain period of time.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
For example, 6 months or 12 months.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:12.000
If the so-called commodity loan from our supplier is at a higher price than the price list at the moment,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000
the supplier can also benefit from cooperation with us through such a scheme.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Other short-term financial obligations that can be at the disposal of the company

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.000
are related to short-term borrowed capital and allow the company to operate in the activity of the company.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You can classify the loans that the company receives in the form of borrowed capital

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
according to the following categories.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:25:02.000
First, the target of the loan, the source of the loan, the period of the loan, the form of the loan, and the form of the loan.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:15.000
As for the form of the loan, the loan should be provided for the resources that we attract from the outside.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:31.000
As a loan, the company's assets and third party liabilities can be considered.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
It is necessary to highlight two aspects of the growth of the capital price.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
The slide shows the management aspect, which is the growth of the sales volume,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
and the financial aspect, which is the growth of the company's assets.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000
As I said, these two aspects are constantly present in the strategy of various companies.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:07.000
The financial aspect is often considered as a priority for businesses focused on re-sales.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000
In a traditional situation, the initiative group of managers can turn to the board of directors

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to include any project in the investment budget, focusing on the management aspect, i.e. the growth of sales volume.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000
At the same time, the board of directors can correct this application and say, for example,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that they are ready to allocate 10 million dollars for the implementation of the project,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and they agree that the net profit from the results of this project will be 3 million dollars per year.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:54.000
In addition, they can ensure that the market value of the new business, which will be allocated to a separate company,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
will cost about 20 million dollars per year.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
This is a more complex task, primarily from an organizational point of view,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
but for shareholders, the financial aspect can be the first priority, rather than the management aspect.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:22.000
The capital profit of a company is represented by the formula as a ratio of the profit divided by the size of the capital itself

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:32.000
minus the dividends divided by the size of the capital itself plus the additional share release divided by the size of the capital itself.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:44.000
At the same time, the profitability of the capital itself is calculated as the division of the profit by the total amount of assets

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:54.000
or the cost of the property complex that is at the disposal of the company plus the difference in the ratio of the profit to the assets

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:02.000
for the withdrawal of interest that must be paid for the maintenance of the borrowed capital to the increase of the borrowed capital,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
all this multiplied by the borrowed capital.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:20.000
The profitability of the assets in the company is calculated as the profit in relation to the revenue multiplied by the revenue divided by the amount of assets,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:29.000
which can be expanded and represented by the formula of profitability of sales multiplied by the turnover of assets.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
As for the main task that is set before the managers in the complex,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
that is, regardless of their division into a separate functional zone of responsibility,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:47.000
shareholders set tasks in the category of these two aspects.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
These formulas can be used universally for any type of business,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and they are the main ones on the basis of which you can determine the quality of management in the company

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.000
and, accordingly, determine the motivational component of the entire management team of the enterprise.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:16.000
To summarize the first question, I would like to note the following.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:25.000
The management of capital in the company is the prerogative of the financial and economic services,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
and the financial director is the final responsibility for the management of capital.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:43.000
At the same time, the financial director experiences restrictions from the shareholders on the share of their own and borrowed capital, which the company can exploit.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:51.000
At the same time, he has tasks to support the profitability of the company's current activities.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
It is clear that the financial director is responsible for the distribution and cost of the company,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:10.000
but at the same time, he can demand from the commercial functional blocks and marketing functional links

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:22.000
to perform tasks on the unloading and price, which would allow to perform tasks on the profitability of the current activity.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000
The financial policy of the company is the main burden for the management of capital,

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
because it is connected with the final result of the company's activities as a whole.
