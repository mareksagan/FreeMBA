WEBVTT

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.400
My name is Andrei Eldenov.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.480
I am a consultant in management

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.700
and financial planning.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.460
Today we discuss the topic in the section

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.180
of finance, the capital of the company

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.980
and the ways of its formation.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.960
Regarding my personal biography,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.820
I want to note that I have been engaged

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.660
in financial planning for 15 years

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.580
and in my work experience I have

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.680
recorded from the position

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.620
of ordinary accountant to the financial

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.040
director and general manager of

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.460
a large jewelry company.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.200
We are considering three topics

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.980
on this subject.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.700
The first theme concerns the sources

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.740
of finance, where we will have to give

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.160
a characteristic of what is finance

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.040
for the company, what are the main

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.200
functions and purpose of finance for

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.380
the economic mechanism, entrepreneurship

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.760
and organization.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.440
The second theme will be devoted

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500
to the price of financial resources,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.700
since money is also a commodity,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.500
and at the same time we are customers

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.740
from such money providers

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.580
as banks, financial companies,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.540
investment organizations.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.740
And the borrowed money we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.640
use to develop our business.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.040
The third issue is the money market.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.780
That is, the offer that exists

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020
today and how this offer

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.420
can be used as effectively

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.840
as possible.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.200
The main objectives

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.620
we pursue when discussing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.080
this topic are to give,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.780
on the one hand,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280
a methodological

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280
part regarding how the capital

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.480
of a business company

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.220
is formed and managed.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.960
On the other hand, we are interested

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.980
in the practical aspect of what

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.280
good and positive methodologies,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.980
practical skills exist in

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.720
managers of Russian and Western

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.320
companies today.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.220
How can this be used

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.280
and exploited in your own

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.100
business or in your

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900
own work practice.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.520
About the first topic.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.360
The definition of capital of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.440
a firm is defined

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.940
as the total value of funds

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.560
in monetary, material

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.420
and intangible forms, which

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.940
is invested in the formation

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.580
of assets undertaken

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.600
to the organization.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.540
Every business starts with

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.040
start-up capital.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.500
Regardless of whether the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.380
company is organized from scratch

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.320
or it is the object of allocating

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.500
to a subsidiary structure of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.540
some amount of assets previously

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.900
effective or less effective

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380
used by the parent company.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020
We assume that the allocated investments

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.960
are undoubtedly multiplier-

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.440
oriented, that is, the owners assume

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.880
to receive additional net cash

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760
flow, which will be able to increase

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.140
the value of assets in material

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.940
and intangible form and, accordingly,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.200
by increasing the value

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720
of the business, by

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.500
increasing the net cash

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.660
flow through the received profit,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.200
the shareholders perform

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.980
the tasks assigned before

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.840
the general meeting of shareholders

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.240
and are satisfied with the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.200
investment investments that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.660
have been made in the business

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.400
of a particular

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.760
business entity.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.720
Here, it is also necessary to note

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.220
a very important point that in terms

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.740
of the company’s capital we say

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.940
that yes, the main and most acceptable

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.620
source of financing for any

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.200
business is net profit.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.980
But in addition, if the company

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.940
has the opportunity to take advantage

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.000
of a favorable external environment,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.900
that is, when there is the opportunity

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.000
to promote a competitive,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.020
attractive product

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.760
or some kind of service to the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.780
market, it is necessary to develop

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.040
very quickly and extensively.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.680
Without extensive growth,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.900
unfortunately, it is impossible

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.400
to take a leading market position,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.020
and as General Electric President

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.280
Jack Welch said, the market could

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.940
be either first, second,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.040
or no.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.640
Accordingly, those companies

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.820
that, due to certain restrictions,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.840
say, the same shareholders,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.380
do not use borrowed capital

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.540
in their development, can

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.840
lose in time and may lose

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.420
positions.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.160
Accordingly, the impact of

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.650
competitors can be compared to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.600
the distribution of gas in the free space.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.980
That is, competitors will occupy

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.300
all the free platforms, and subsequently

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.900
the delay, which was caused by

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.000
insufficient amount of capital

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
of the company, so that it could

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.720
be effectively and extensively

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.660
develop, will play a bad

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.300
joke.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.620
That is, when the company will be

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.040
forced to compete with the stronger

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.800
or with the advantage of the external

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.580
conditions of the market

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.440
favorable conditions from

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.980
the competitors.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.380
And competition will affect

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.280
the profit that the company

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.780
receives and should receive.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960
Consequently, the receipt of

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.600
profits itself may be more problematic.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.820
From which we can conclude that

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.760
capital must always act

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.000
effectively and focus

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.120
on meeting the needs of solvent

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.420
customers on the one hand, and

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.640
the company should never experience

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.540
capital constraints when shaping

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.380
its development strategy

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.760
on the other hand, if

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.440
there are really favorable

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.840
conditions.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.220
The slide shows the characteristics

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.900
of the company's capital.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.300
But one can distinguish the

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.300
following main ones, that capital

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.740
is the main factor of production.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.220
That is, it is impossible

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.900
to force a business to work

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.060
if we do not have sufficient

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.720
amount of capital.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.540
In the practice of finance there is such

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.100
a term as the threshold of entry into business.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.240
It means that a business

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.560
company must have a certain

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.420
reserve or a certain initial

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.400
amount of capital investments

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.680
that will allow to form an

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.140
infrastructure for the business

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.680
that will enable the business

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.960
to be endowed with working capital

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.120
in terms of inventories in

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.260
terms of customer interaction

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.640
and customer debt, cash

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.880
and non-cash money that must

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.500
be at the disposal of

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.940
the company, that is, all

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.040
these assets require

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.480
a capital amount.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.180
Capital can be formed only from

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.860
two sources, either at the expense

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.740
of own resources, and this is primarily

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.660
the resource shareholders and the

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.220
previous net profit of the company.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.620
The second component is borrowed

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.060
capital, that is, the capital

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.640
that a company can attract in

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.860
the external environment,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.260
using the services of banks,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.160
investment and financial

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.960
companies, imitating its own

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.640
debt obligations in the form

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.340
of bills or corporate bonds.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.580
Well, it is also possible to increase the

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.300
authorized capital through the issuance of

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.280
shares, but in this case the decisions

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.060
must be made by the shareholders.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.120
Therefore, without capital, production

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.880
is impossible, the stage of product

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.620
formation is impossible.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.820
If a company has no production,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.640
it has no product, and

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.920
if a company has no product, it

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.580
can not sell anything, that

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.700
is, the business has no possibility

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.120
to exist.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.820
Therefore, capital is of course

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.900
the main factor of production,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.440
which must be taken into account,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.860
first of all, in the framework

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.060
of financial planning.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.300
Capital is the financial resources

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.820
of the company that bring income.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.300
Each shareholder will always

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.740
strive to invest resources

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.760
in those areas that

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.400
give the maximum return.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.800
And will welcome those proposals

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.340
and decisions of the

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.740
management staff that will ensure

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.220
on the one hand the minimum

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.240
amount of investment, on the

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.400
other hand the maximum amount

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.840
of return on investments.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.400
And, accordingly, capital will

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.980
multiply with minimal investments,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.500
this is the most acceptable or

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.300
most desirable field for shareholders

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.860
of the company who are seeking

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.360
to develop this business.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.740
Accordingly, if shareholders

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.500
invest resources in those projects

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.080
that managers offer,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.100
they are still focused

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.700
on such criteria as

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.560
time.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.040
That is, shareholders are interested

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.900
in ensuring that with minimal

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.120
investments and maximum return

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.820
on invested capital, the business

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.540
could still provide such results

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.080
for a long time.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.060
That is, investments are necessary

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.560
to support, develop and maintain

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.600
the achieved result in the

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.680
form of net profit or net cash

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.780
flow, which is the result of

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.400
the company's activities.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.380
The third and important element of

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.600
the general characteristics of the company’

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.840
s capital is that capital is

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.940
the main source of the formation

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.780
of the well-being of its owners.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.700
Net profit as a result of the

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.540
company's activities is in the balance

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.640
sheet of any entrepreneur

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.820
of the organization part of the

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.540
own capital or just the result,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.520
the added value to the total

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.540
value of the company, which

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.200
for a certain period of time received

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.820
the managers of the company,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.060
who manage and operate the

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.200
assets of the company.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.940
And the stockholder’s stock

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.240
is not only valued in the form of

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.620
the dividends they receive,

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.720
that is, as an element of the

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.460
distribution of net profit, but

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.840
also as an increase in the value

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.720
of the company’s business itself.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.180
And we, of course, in recent years

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.900
are focusing more and more on

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.500
the area of the value of our

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.020
business.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.280
The cost of business can grow as a

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.060
result of external factors, that

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.100
is, assume, in general, the industry

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.060
is favorable to the market situation,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.900
when suppliers who work in

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.240
a separate industry, have all

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.080
increased demand for the

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.800
products produced, at the same

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.340
time with the increase of

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.460
prices for this product.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.200
If you consider hydrocarbon raw materials,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.760
the hydrocarbon raw

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.640
materials suppliers have

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.860
felt the most favorable market

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.520
conditions over

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.600
the past seven years.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.660
And, of course, it is thanks to this

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.220
element that the welfare of shareholders

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.220
of hydrocarbon companies and those

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.660
engaged in the processing of hydrocarbon

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.580
raw materials, the welfare

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.900
of shareholders is rising dramatically

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.300
compared to those periods

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.780
of time when the market price

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.180
of oil was about $13

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.340
per barrel.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.180
The price increase has benefited

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.700
the net cash flow and net profit

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.740
that the company receives, and

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.880
at the same time the value of

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.960
the shares and the consequent

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.520
value of the entire assets

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.660
of the oil companies.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.060
The next element of the characteristics

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.880
of the company’s capital is that

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.440
the capital of the firm is the

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.340
main measure of its market value.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.740
If we consider the offer to buy

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.380
or prepare the offer to sell our

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.720
business, then the most understandable

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.880
for both the buyer and

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.420
the seller of our assets, or

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.800
the independent valuator

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.100
who, on behalf of either the

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.960
buyer or the seller of assets,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.340
forms the commercial offer,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.720
will be the monetary

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.360
valuation.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.340
And the amount of equity, which is

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.820
formed from the authorized capital

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.640
of our shareholders, who either at

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.260
the initial stage of the formation

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.500
of the business allocated the

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.960
amount of resources for its development,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.540
additional capital as the revaluation

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.280
of our assets primarily in the

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.060
part of non-currency assets,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.700
assets, possibly, land, which

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.620
may be at the disposal of

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.700
the company, intangible

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.680
assets, long-term

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.740
financial investments

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.840
in other.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.120
In addition, the net profit

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.840
that was received by the company

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.820
in previous periods of time,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.180
i.e. in past years and in the

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.840
current period of time.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.020
Thus, all three main components

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.920
are the components of the

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.480
company’s own capital.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.040
And depending on the dynamics

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.160
of its change, in the event that

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.540
in the declared analytical

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.280
documentation or a potential

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.620
buyer or potential seller

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.040
who is going to sell own assets

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.220
sees the corresponding dynamics,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.780
it is calculated in monetary

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.340
equivalent, in addition

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.460
to the time criterion

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.900
and it is possible to estimate

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.780
the rate of growth of

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.540
own capital.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.940
And this indicator primarily

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.460
affects the cost that can

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.440
be determined for a given

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.200
business.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.400
The next element of the characteristics of

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.560
the capital of the firm is that the capital

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.880
dynamics of the firm is the most important

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.420
barometer of the level of efficiency

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.680
of its economic activity.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.300
That is, if we present the net profit

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.260
as a logical deduction of the volume

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.280
of revenue from the sale that

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.420
is at the disposal of the company,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.740
all the funded costs of a current

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.760
nature, then we can say that

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.200
the net profit has been obtained.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.660
At the same time, we say that the revenue

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.980
from the implementation is a favorable

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.860
interaction with the company’

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.900
s customers.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.760
It is a kind of parity

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.060
or arrangement when good to

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.000
customers in terms of price,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.180
quality and service that our

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.760
company offers on products

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.840
and on the procedure

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.100
of customer service work.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560
On the other hand, the costs that are

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.680
available to the company are primarily

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.060
a consequence of management

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.780
decisions that are made by

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.160
the company manager.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.920
Any management decision

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.980
is costly.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.380
Once the manager makes a decision,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.620
the company immediately begins to

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.760
spend money, at least in the

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.620
form of the salary fund of the manager

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.280
himself, his subordinates,

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.060
and the time that is necessary

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.880
to implement decisions and

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.380
a certain result.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.280
That is, net profit is a consequence

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.780
of the efficiency of the management

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.720
company, which is represented

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.320
by hiring managers.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.760
And if the company or team works

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.380
effectively, the minimum

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.220
level of costs will provide

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.140
the maximum amount

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.380
of net profit.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.020
And the capital dynamics of the company

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.920
just shows the efficiency of management.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.400
There may be no qualitative

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.940
characteristic, but at the same

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.740
time an analyst who

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.820
considers the statistics

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.880
and capital indicators of a company,

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.840
both in the equity and in

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.360
the loan capital, can determine

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.260
what quality or what global

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.680
effective state of management

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.560
in the company.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.080
A few words about the principles

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.240
of capital formation of the company.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.520
The slide presents five

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.240
basic principles that can be noted.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.400
First of all, consider the prospects for

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.340
the development of the business

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.540
activity of the company.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.320
In this case, we say that capital

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.080
is always effective if

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.900
the company develops

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.180
extensively.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.700
That is, additional capital investment

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.900
allows you to quickly and

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.460
at the same time effectively

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.700
develop the company extensively,

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.720
open new branches, build additional

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.100
production sites,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.880
hire additional staff

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.400
of qualified employees

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.700
who can more productively

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.260
and more effectively

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.340
manage the economic

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.840
processes that

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.740
occur in the company.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.960
But at the same time we are talking

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.920
about the fact that in the event that

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.340
the company falls into a stagnant

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.680
zone, an unstable market situation

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.560
in terms of effective solvent

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.480
demand, when the company predicts

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.060
a stagnant market, and possibly

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.100
a crisis, which is expressed

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.000
in the fact that the purchasing

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.220
activity of our customers

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.380
decreases.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.000
At the same time, it is expressed

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.420
as the desire of customers to reduce

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.140
the price of products purchased

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.500
from our company, and at the same

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.660
time with the desire or demand

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.500
to reduce the volume due to the

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.260
lack of our customers,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.260
or investment funds, if we issue,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.960
suppose, the main assets, some

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.740
types of equipment, or

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.660
it is about the release of

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.140
software, that is, when companies

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.180
relating to our customers

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.100
are treated negatively to

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.700
additional capital

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.760
investments, this will

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.780
of course affect us

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.080
as the manufacturers

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.640
of the products concerned.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.140
At the same time, the remaining

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.640
customers who still use the resources

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.260
of the investment volume that

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.200
are at their disposal will

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.420
claim to reduce prices.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.660
And in the event of stagnation

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.860
we are as the prospect of further

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.840
development, that is, we plan to wait

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.220
or survive the crisis and to focus

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.740
all our management efforts on

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.520
preserving our capital.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.580
Capital retention on the condition

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.280
of reducing revenue from implementation

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.240
is possible only through

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.900
effective cost management.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.040
That is, when we need to reduce

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.900
the costs of both the maintenance

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.380
of our business and the costs

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.620
related to the main production

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.920
or technological processes

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.260
that are in our company.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.540
That is, in this case we

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.860
consider as a prospect precisely

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.600
the task of conserving capital,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.340
but at the same time, from

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.520
a strategic point of view,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.080
if our company considers as one

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.840
of the elements of its development

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.820
strategy the operations to

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.660
absorb competitors in the

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.640
market, that is, through financial

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.580
purchase, or through the combination

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.640
of assets, we must consider

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.260
a very important point.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.880
In the face of the crisis, our competitors

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.820
are at the cheapest price.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.180
And if we have the opportunity to

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.040
attract additional amount of borrowed

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.720
capital in the conditions of a

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.120
crisis, and this can be both the

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.900
merit of the managers themselves and

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.220
the participation of shareholders,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.920
then in this case in the conditions

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.220
of a crisis we can acquire or buy

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.940
or absorb our competitors

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.160
with minimal costs.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.080
In the conditions of the rise of

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:37.440
the market, of course, all players and with

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.060
the growth in the dynamics of equity

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.520
all competitors will be costing

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.160
as much as possible.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.700
In the context of a crisis, we

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.620
can use two approaches.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.480
The first approach is to save

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.120
our capital by optimizing

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.980
costs and reducing costs.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.800
The second is the increase

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.380
in investment activity.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.100
That is, when the available capital

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.560
is available, plus the borrowed capital

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.560
we are directed to buy our

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.960
competitors.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.780
Again, I will emphasize that

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.280
only if there is such an element

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.580
in our development

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.700
strategy, when we consider

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.060
options and offers to

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.980
buy our competitors,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.980
then this technique

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.600
can also work.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.080
The second principle is to ensure

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.540
that the amount of capital attracted

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.100
corresponds to the amount of assets

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.500
of the enterprise.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.400
In this case, it is about the fact

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.580
that shareholders can set

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.400
a task regarding the

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.860
profitability of the company.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.800
And the task is not seen as a

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.780
tough dogma.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.520
A task is considered to be the

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.560
sense or parity of shareholders

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.440
to participate in a business

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.000
that has a certain share

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.920
or percentage of profitability.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.200
That is, if the profitability

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.420
of current activity does

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.820
not meet the expectations of shareholders,

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.000
shareholders do not want or do

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.900
not seek to develop such a

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.620
business.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.580
And when we talk about the principle

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.180
of ensuring the correspondence between

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.500
the amount of capital attracted to

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.960
the amount of assets formed

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.420
by the enterprise, we mean the situation

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.420
where the initial capital is allocated,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.040
and at the same time there

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.900
is a task on the orientation

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.160
of activity.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.120
This means that after a

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.820
certain period of time, usually

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.920
one calendar year, it will

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.200
be possible to measure the actual

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.900
balance sheet of the company and

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.980
determine how much the assets

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.600
or assets that are at the

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.680
disposal of the company

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.040
have grown at the expense of

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.820
the reinvested net profit.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.720
The second point within this principle

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.620
from shareholders may be a limitation

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.440
on the attraction of borrowed

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.180
capital.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.320
That is, when a company is experiencing

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.120
certain risks in such a direction

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.540
as financial stability, financial

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.700
stability is first and

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.560
foremost the ratio of equity

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.440
that is at the disposal of the

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.720
company and borrowed capital,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.040
especially bank loans and loans

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.980
that the company takes in the

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.860
external environment to support

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.160
its own development, to

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.600
increase the volume of production,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.960
respectively the volume

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.260
of revenue from the sale.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.540
Shareholders may limit the

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.120
management of the company to certain

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.200
frameworks or norms, which are

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.040
expressed primarily by the

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.680
ratio of own and borrowed

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.500
capital.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.420
And in the event that we speak about

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.860
the need for additional resources,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.200
that is, we claim that loans

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.260
are needed, we claim as less, we

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.320
will assume in a service or analytical

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.540
note to the board of directors

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.920
that we are losing certain prospects

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.860
and benefits that you could

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.380
get in the future only

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.620
from the limitations

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.780
of normatives.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.140
Very often from the shareholders, which

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.960
are represented by the Board

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.900
of Directors, there is a formalized

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.620
reaction that the norm is set and

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.060
in the event that you

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.380
really have the opportunity to develop

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.160
effectively, you need to start

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.100
working with the company's

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.320
working capital, that is, as

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.200
regards the optimization of

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.860
the stocks available to the company,

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.040
which are also formed

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.060
at the expense of own capital

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.840
and borrowed capital.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.240
This applies to stocks of raw materials

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.600
and materials or goods for resale.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.640
This applies to the volume of unfinished

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.280
production if we consider

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.920
the industrial or manufacturing

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.940
sphere.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.120
This also applies to debt

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.600
management, when timely recovery

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.500
or transition to work with

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.860
customers to a relationship associated

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.860
with receiving advance payment

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.800
for previously shipped products

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.520
or services ordered, will

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.940
allow to increase the rate

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.800
of money turnover, which means,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.380
in a smaller amount in terms

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.360
of interest rate to get a return

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.280
on the invested capital,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.480
that is, profit from current

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.800
activity.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.480
And it is the optimum structure of capital

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.280
from the position of the asset volume

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.660
in the enterprise is also one of

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.380
the basic principles.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.980
The third principle is to ensure

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.140
the optimum structure of capital from

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.220
the perspective of its effective functioning.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.540
It is a condition that the

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.540
capital must be exactly

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.460
as much as is required for

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.540
the most efficient activity.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.680
There are many examples of organizational

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.380
procedures of centralization

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.540
and decentralization.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.520
That is, if a large structure

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.820
is being merged, it will require

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.460
a large amount of capital investment,

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.000
reach the limit level

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.540
of efficiency within the current

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.140
activity, and the limit

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.980
efficiency within the current

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.440
activity can be estimated

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.880
based on net sales profitability

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.940
indicators,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.860
first of all.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.320
That is, when from period to period

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.580
net sales profitability begins

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.460
to decrease, this is only

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.920
happening by a change in the larger

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.680
direction of the costs that

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.840
are available to the

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.760
company, that is, when the costs

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.780
grow at higher and ahead

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.380
of the rate of growth of revenue

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.580
from the sale, it can be decided

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.420
on the cessation of the growth

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.980
of assets that are available to

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.540
the company, that is, the property

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.340
complex, to stop hiring personnel

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.940
to the main company and

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.620
take an event on decentralization

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.920
or asset distribution, when

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.880
through the allocation of individual

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.340
or subsidiary companies, or

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.800
companies with a share in the

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.920
share capital of both the parent

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.400
company and partners,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.840
attempts are made to reduce

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.340
the cost overall of the consolidated

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.820
reporting group, and first

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.260
of all this is related

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.640
to the efficiency

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640
of the group of

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.140
companies as a whole.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.880
I also think that here a very important

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.000
point should be noted.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.440
In the context of the crisis, we observe

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.200
in almost all industries, in almost

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.400
all companies, techniques

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.900
associated with decentralization.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.340
That is, when companies, striving

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.080
to keep the specified parameters

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.360
or planned parameters

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.100
on performance, allocate separate

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.280
blocks of the property complex

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.260
to subsidiaries in order

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.760
to match the amount of costs

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.540
that are in the company,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.880
the amount of income, as revenues

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.440
from the sale, which

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.120
are at the disposal

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.220
of the company.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.800
But, of course, from an organisational

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.960
point of view, assets are not disclosed

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.620
as uncontrollable missiles, that is,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:48.600
subsidiaries support the development

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.920
and implementation of the company’

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.680
s strategy and in no case behave

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.300
like uncontrollable missiles.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.580
In the conditions of market growth,

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.640
in the conditions of a favorable

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.480
situation, the reverse

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.140
state, that is, the decentralized

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.520
structure representing a

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.940
group of companies, begins to

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.440
merge into a single holding

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.740
structure, there are many

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.080
examples when the media

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.180
announces the transition

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.760
to one share of a particular

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.820
group of companies.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.900
The explanation is very simple, this

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.680
is due to the increase in the efficiency

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.200
of the company's functioning, when overall

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.920
the volume of revenue from the holding's

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.720
implementation grows, when there is a

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.240
possibility to exclude duplicate functions

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.900
from the management system, unnecessary

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.320
or ineffective.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.720
That is, the volume of costs will

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.480
not grow as fast as the volume of

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.800
revenue from implementation.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.020
If the volume of revenue from

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.040
the sale grows at a higher rate,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.300
this is the first sign that

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.220
the capital at the disposal of

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.380
the company is being

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.500
exploited or used with maximum

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.640
efficiency and orderly better

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.340
than in the previous

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.420
period of time.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.460
The fourth principle is to ensure

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.440
that the cost of capital formation from

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.160
various sources is minimized.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.240
This is the so-called diversification

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.380
of borrowing and it is connected

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.880
and treated as equity, if

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.420
we allow considering the

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.680
largest company in terms of capital

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.500
and value in the world as ExxonMobil,

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.920
which today is information

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.300
confirmed by information

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.120
that the free market

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.020
is around 99.5% of

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.640
shares.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.020
A fully private company.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.400
It is clear that there are

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.860
key shareholders who are

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.860
holders of large shares, but at

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.860
the same time there is a

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.320
huge number of frequent

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.760
shareholders or small

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.880
minority shareholders who

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.660
are holders of the company’s

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.400
securities.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.240
And, first of all, they are focused

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.100
on the growth of the value of

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.000
a given company, on the growth of its

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.920
capital, first of all in monetary

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.160
terms at the expense of the

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.180
net profit received.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.460
And all shareholders,

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.420
including ExxonMobil, are

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.260
trying to diversify capital

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.600
raising.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.960
That is, when it comes to the issuance

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.460
of shares of the parent company itself,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.700
when it comes to the increase in

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.880
the issuance of

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.340
shares of separate territorial units.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.280
The borrowed capital.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.320
When companies consider the possibility

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.320
of working with not the

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.220
only strategic partner, let

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.360
us admit in the format of a bank

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.960
that is part of a group of companies,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.320
and focuses on diversifying borrowings

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.620
related to the cost of money,

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.020
related to the time of attraction,

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.500
related to the possibility

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.640
of allocating certain limits

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.800
or the size of credit lines

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.140
in a particular bank.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.200
And thus a loan portfolio

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.540
company can represent a certain

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:27.880
segmentation when we are more

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.740
than banks that serve our

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.200
debts.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.900
And this is just about not risking

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.660
when managing borrowed capital

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.840
or, as they say, not laying

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.400
all the eggs in one basket

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.160
and not working with a

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.000
single key partner on the borrowed

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.840
capital front with

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.200
a single key bank.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.600
Any monopoly allows you to

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.740
dictate conditions, including if

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.220
we work with one bank, then all

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.960
issues related to the change of terms

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.320
of credit contracts or agreements,

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.040
with the terms of lending,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.780
with the interest rate,

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.160
with the terms, with the volumes,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.920
will be associated with

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.200
certain difficulties.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.320
To avoid these difficulties,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.280
you can use different

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.980
sources of borrowing capital

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.240
formation.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.880
The fifth principle is to ensure

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.180
the highly efficient use of capital

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.180
in the process of economic activity.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.100
We talked about that.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.360
The only indicator that shows

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360
the effective use of capital

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.260
is first of all net profitability

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.900
of sales, secondly

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.360
the value of the company's

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.560
business as a whole,

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.900
which is mainly made up

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.140
of the size and dynamics

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.820
of the change in the

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.300
larger side of the

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.600
company's own capital.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.960
In the next slide you can see

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.120
the systematization of capital

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.380
types by the main

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.680
classification features.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.400
When the question arises

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.700
about the practical significance

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.980
of this classification, we

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.160
first say that this slide

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.760
attempts to reach leverages

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.320
or some elements to some

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.740
areas of capital management

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.480
in the company from

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.320
general to private.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.700
According to the company, there

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.620
are two major groups of

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.880
capital, own and default capital.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.600
The purpose of the use of

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.680
productive capital is, of course,

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.420
the one that is the source of

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.180
the formation of non-currency

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.980
assets of the company, as regards

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.660
the first of the basic

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.040
assets, which are the

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.760
infrastructure for

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.620
production processes.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.660
And, of course, capital is the

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.960
basis for the formation

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.700
of working capital, that is, that

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.820
which is sometimes called working

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.960
capital or the working capital

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.160
of the enterprise is the

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.080
source of generating net profit.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.220
That is, through the current

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.480
funds, any company

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.040
finances its own current activities.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.480
The source is also the company capital.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.980
The Judicial Capital.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.920
We use ship capital or

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.680
borrowed capital to expand

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.220
our company.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.160
We have inefficient

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.800
management to solve some

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.460
current fire problems.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.580
That is, when we lack money,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.740
we use the capital to

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.000
recredit, to wait for a certain

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.740
period of time for more

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.740
favorable conditions,

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.380
primarily in business activity.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.740
And thus we have the opportunity, at

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.300
the expense of the partner bank

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.460
with us, to solve these problems.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.180
Speculative capital is a

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.480
very important point in

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.040
terms of speculative capital.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.620
Many companies, now Russian

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.580
companies, use speculative

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.020
capital to regulate

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.120
foreign debt.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.700
If we, say, simulate our

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.300
own bills or bonds, often

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.320
companies can buy back their

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.220
own debt obligations

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.880
in the market, when, say, they

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.760
are not favorable or, say so,

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.420
low quotes, uninteresting,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.540
say so, for their mass

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.820
the main holder of corporate debt

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.720
obligations in the person

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.360
of investors, speculators,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.400
then the company can act

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.540
as a buyer of its own debt,

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.200
and at the same time

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.440
with the growth of the market,

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.320
that is, when there is a

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.140
need for placing free cash,

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.260
the company can sell

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.080
its debt obligations.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.040
The same is true of a company’s

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.000
shares, when many companies are

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.920
buyers of their own shares during

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.220
the fall in market quotations and

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.260
at the same time are the largest

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.000
sellers of their own stock packages

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.260
when there is a rise in quotations

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.180
or an increase in the value

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:30.160
of the shares on the stock market.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.720
And very often this technique

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.320
is used in a situation when managers

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.560
know the prospect of the development

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.840
of the financial result of the company's

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.540
activities for the current period

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.940
of time begins to prepare for, say,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:50.740
a long period before the end

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.620
of the financial year, and 9-12 months

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.980
before the end of the year begins

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.540
the purchase through authorized

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.240
companies or on behalf

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.720
of shares of the company.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.980
And after there are declarations

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.700
that we have received a net profit

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.960
increase in order higher than the

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.400
official plans, and the official

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.700
plans are primarily related to the

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.080
company’s development strategy,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.120
then of course there will be a

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.020
revival in the market in relation

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.520
to the securities of this

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.480
company and quotations will

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.700
go up.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.100
At this point, the company is

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.000
selling its own shares.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.020
The following classification

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.760
characteristics of capital

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.000
investment.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.820
These variations include capital

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.340
in financial form, capital

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.840
in material form and capital

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.720
in intangible form.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.820
All of the classification

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.500
features listed correspond to

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.940
the formation of the company's assets

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.100
and, of course, have a monetary

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.100
valuation.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.840
If we consider the

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.820
possibility of implementing

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.180
a joint project with our new

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.720
partners, then not only in

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.900
monetary terms can capital

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.800
of both parties be allocated,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.280
but, of course, in material

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.540
or in immaterial form.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.660
One example of capital in

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.580
intangible form can be considered

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.160
such specificity of Russian

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.260
business as administrative

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.100
regulation or influence administrative

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.180
processes, or so-called government

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.000
relationship, that is, when

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.500
we use intangible assets

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.820
of one or another party in

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.540
agreement with the authorities,

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.000
or when capital in intangible

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.200
form can be represented

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.520
by trademarks that are

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.080
at the disposal of the

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.340
company, brands, other

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.780
components that belong

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.420
to the category of intangible

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.400
assets, also formed

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.200
from own and

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.680
borrowed capital.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.160
The following classification characteristics

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.260
by investment objects.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.400
Capital is primarily directed to increase

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.560
the principal capital or non-currency

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.940
assets of the company and the working

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.720
capital or to form the working

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.920
capital of the enterprise,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.280
in the form of being in the process

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.360
of turnover.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.460
The famous Marxist formula “money,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.400
commodity, money, stitch” and set

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.360
the boundary or the gradation of

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.860
the circulation of capital that

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.720
exists in all branches.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.940
That is, capital can be in the

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.100
form of money, capital can be in the

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.700
form of production and capital can

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.500
be in the form of commodity.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.320
As for the first, second and

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.120
third components, it never and

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.580
in no case implies a halt

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.580
in capital or a halt in capital

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.220
circulation.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.400
If this happens, we will unfortunately

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.180
conclude that the business has

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.340
ceased to exist and the absence

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.680
of capital circulation in no

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.420
way means the possibility

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.180
of a rapid recovery

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.620
of the rate of capital

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.900
circulation.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.100
At the same time, the stop of the

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.860
circle of capital turnover means

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.080
the absence of net profit

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.940
of the company.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.180
The following slide presents the

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.140
systematization of capital types

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.520
by the main classification features.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.100
According to the forms of ownership, private

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.640
state capital is distinguished.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.460
Now this is becoming most

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.500
relevant for Russian companies

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.560
due to large projects related

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.260
to private state partnership.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.500
And when we talk about the

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.820
fact that state companies

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.880
are key investors in the

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.120
national economy today,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.300
this is primarily due to the

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.600
favorable global

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.540
market conditions for

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.420
hydrocarbon raw materials.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.200
And companies like Rosneft and

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.120
Gazprom are the largest players

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.000
in the world, and represent

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.860
state capital.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.920
And the country’s budget is filled in

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.060
large quantities precisely from the

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.080
participation of the state in the capital

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.080
of certain companies.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.560
But at the same time, private

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.640
capital is also rapidly increasing,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.440
and it is important to

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.120
systematize capital by forms

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.160
of ownership in terms of consideration

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.200
of joint projects, public

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.660
participation and

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.560
participation of private investors

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.500
in large construction

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.940
or urban or system-

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.260
forming projects.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.280
According to the legal form of activity,

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.540
share capital, share capital

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.540
and individual capital

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.700
are distinguished.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.980
This is characterized by the capital of open

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.220
joint-stock companies.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.940
Poetic capital is capital

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.800
limited by social correspondence,

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.920
individual capital is capital

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.560
of individual entrepreneurs

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.160
and individuals.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.560


00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.500
By the nature of use in the

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.920
production process, working

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.800
capital is non-working dead

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.520
capital.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.880
Working capital primarily

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.240
refers to the sources of formation

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.760
of the enterprise's main assets,

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.620
which are in permanent operation,

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.600
as regards the plantation

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.620
park involved in the

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.600
implementation of the company's

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.020
production program.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.940
And also working capital refers

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.020
to the formation of the business's

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.600
working capital.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.220
That is, everything that relates

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.000
to raw materials, inventories, the

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.760
volume of unfinished production

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.780
that is at the disposal of

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.720
the company, the volume of finished

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.340
product residues in

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.120
the warehouse.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.120
This also includes debt

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.860
debt and funds that are at

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.360
the disposal of the company.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.740
The non-working dead capital is

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.120
primarily linked in non-

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.380
working assets with production

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.560
capacities that are not

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.300
involved in the company.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.780
And this happens less and less often,

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.660
but sometimes it happens when a product

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.920
position is removed from production

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.300
that is not promising or

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.760
has no commercial result.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.940
And companies are forced to do something

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.100
with the dead capital.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.520
It is necessary to look for buyers

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.320
for this equipment, but if

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.060
non-competitive products are produced

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.020
on this equipment,

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.540
it is extremely difficult to

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.640
find a buyer of such equipment.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.360
Independent fate awaits dead capital

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.340
in the form of assets, that

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.280
is, it is the delivery of

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.120
waste, raw materials, metal, etc.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.360
The non-working dead capital

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.700
also exists in the company’s working assets.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.840
As a rule, these are commodity salaries

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.800
or non-liquid commodity salaries,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.080
those that for some reason cannot

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.200
be sold on the market, or those

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.080
that have been returned by customers

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.260
in the form of a failed marriage.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.660
That is, it is also necessary

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.400
to recycle or to be required

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.300
at extremely low prices only in

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.020
order to at least partially return

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.800
the money for that dead working

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.880
capital that we have received

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.840
in the working assets dead assets

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:54.860
which are called non-working dead

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.740
capital arises very often

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.860
due to mistakes marketing specialists

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.300
and commercial professionals

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.900
in the company.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.620
That is, when demand was overestimated,

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.120
or for some reason the cost

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.920
of the product or service

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.820
produced was unsuccessfully

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.060
formed, it was not competitive

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.420
in the market, not

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.800
in demand.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.580
That is, the customer does not want

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.260
to pay for it.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.020
There is no way to find a parity of price

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.440
and quality, and because of this

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.460
there is a certain amount of non-decreasing

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.260
balance of non-liquids or those assets

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.660
in the trading assets that can

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.300
not be sold, unfortunately.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880
By the nature of the use of

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.980
the owner, consumed capital is allocated

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.940
or sometimes called consumed capital.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.480
The dividend payments.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.280
If the decision to pay dividends is

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.120
made and the shareholders do not send

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.720
the received funds for reinvestments,

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.060
it can be considered that this

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.740
is consumed capital.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.340
Accumulated, reinvested capital

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.840
is the reverse situation when it

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.280
is decided not to pay dividends,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.080
and all net profit as a component

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.420
of own capital to be directed

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.180
to increase either the principal

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.080
capital or the working capital,

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.420
that is, to direct funds

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.220
to purchase non-currency

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.480
assets in the company,

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.380
machines, equipment, possibly

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.160
new technologies, new software

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.520
tools, computer equipment,

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.640
other components, that is,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.200
everything that is related

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.220
to modernization inining

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.620
the infrastructure

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.760
in working condition.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.000
Or a decision is made to direct

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.120
net to increase the volume of purchases

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.020
of raw materials and materials or

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.840
goods for resale, to increase

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.560
market activity regarding marketing

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.880
activities, such as

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.640
shares, participation in advertising

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.440
exhibitions, etc.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.300


00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.640
According to the sources of attraction,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.760
national domestic capital

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.940
is allocated, one that is formed

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.440
by Russian banks and sold in the

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.100
form of credit contracts or supplied,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.040
there is a supply of resources for

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.600
enterprises, and, accordingly,

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.600
national domestic capital

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.440
has a certain value because

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.300
of the fact that the inflation

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.280
impact in Russia is still slightly

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.500
higher on the economy than

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.840
in Europe, and then the value

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.340
of national domestic

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.400
capital is higher than

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.600
the value of Western capital.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.960
This is also related to the stability

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.780
of the economy.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.400
The Russian economy only in

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.720
the last 5-6 years has shown steady

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.460
growth, and growth is linked to

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.940
long-term trends, but for now the

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:06.700
market is not responding so

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.920
responsively to the increasing volume

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.320
of stability in the economy

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.920
and still compared to the Western

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.120
markets, the cost of attraction

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.960
in the domestic market is

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.000
higher than attraction in foreign

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.080
markets.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.520
The second category of

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.660
sources of attraction is

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.000
foreign capital.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.560
Cost of the enterprise capital.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.400
The slide provides a reasoning

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.740
for the fact that the value

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.280
of capital is the price that

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.780
the entity pays for its attraction

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.460
from various sources.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.760
It is clear that attracting is

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.600
part of any business’s search function.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.700
And in the event that the company

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.720
purposefully seeks sources of

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.260
capital, it is possible to get

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.700
good results in terms of the

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.440
value and quality of the capital

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.080
acquired, either in temporary

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.600
use as regards bank credit or permanent

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.460
use, which is acceptable as

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.080
regards share capital, the

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.540
main areas of use of the capital

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.460
value indicator in the enterprise's

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.040
activities are allocated, since

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.240
the value of capital

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:29.060
serves as a measure

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.420
of the profitability

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.520
of operational activity.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.760
It is meant that the increase

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.840
in equity capital due to the

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.380
net profit received by the company

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:47.280
can be estimated through the

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.060
operating performance,

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.560
that is, the intensity

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.400
of the company's net profit,

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.700
how it affects the growth

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.340
of the value of capital.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.920
The second component is

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.380
the value of capital used

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.780
as a criterion process

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.280
for real investment.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.200
In the event that we are talking

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.520
about the fact that

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.480
we have diversified areas of activity,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.200
at the same time each of the areas

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.620
of activity has certain

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.240
prospects, that is, someone of

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.060
the managers today oversees the

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.540
key areas that have already

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.340
gone to the planned capacity, where

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.460
the value of capital and the

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:34.400
increase in this value at the

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.480
expense of the net profit received

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.400
is already clear.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.700
Understood the amount of capital

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.560
attracted by the side, the price

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.580
of this capital, the methods of

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.700
attraction, either temporarily

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.540
or on a permanent basis,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.740
in this case we say that the company

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.840
can build certain criteria,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.960
which are exactly in the

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.880
value of capital of individual

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.240
areas of activity.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.980
In the event that the company

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.520
is not linked to a rigid industry

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.620
strategy, let’s assume that

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.160
we are dealing only with

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.340
one business area,

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.740
accompanying when they have the

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:20.760
right to exist, but

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.620
oriented to sell.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.260
Sometimes companies use

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.660
this strategy.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.120
When we say we are a

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.760
diversified company and no

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.380
longer operate as a branch

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.020
or specialized company, but

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.100
more as an investment

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.360
company.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.380
That is, we invest funds primarily

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.080
in those areas of activity

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.760
where the value of capital

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.300
is the main criterion.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.060


00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.780
If the value rises faster,

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.360
if the value rises with the expected

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.540
outcome for shareholders, we

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.140
will, of course, invest

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.560
in these directions.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.720
The cost of capital is the basic indicator

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.420
of the formation of the

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.700
efficiency of financial

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.860
investment, the third component.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.560
It is meant that the value of capital

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.020
is an undeniable and, say so, not long

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.000
discussed indicator, which

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.660
answers the question of whether

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.060
resources are effectively

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.980
or inefficiently invested in the

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:28.540
company.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.940
To do this, it is enough to apply the

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.820
results of the work accounting period,

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.020
the certificates, the state

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.880
of the budget plan, the execution

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.800
of this budget plan and the

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.480
analysis of the financial result of

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.820
working with different areas of activity

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.720
in our company, the growth of the

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.580
company's value as a whole and

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.560
the contribution of individual

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.580
areas to this value.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.920
The fourth component -

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.140
the value of capital is the

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.840
criteria for making management

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.600
decisions regarding the

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.220
use of rental or leasing or the

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.760
acquisition of ownership of

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.720
production assets is a situation

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.820
when we analyze what is more

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.140
advantageous for us on the one

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.120
hand if we use leasing then in

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.340
this case all lease payments

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:27.520
go to tax reduction if we consider

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.180
the amount of the company's

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.720
own capital, then we say

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.580
that the exploitation of

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.040
leasing equipment makes a certain

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.720
contribution to the net

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.420
profit, but at the same time

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.280
it would be in order higher

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.900
if we did not take the technology

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.140
or the basic assets

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.680
in leasing, but bought

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.420
them through a bank

00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.940
loan.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.960
That is, then, yes, you would

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.580
show more of the company’s

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.100
operating profit, while at the

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.120
same time we, sacrificing a

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.600
24% income tax rate, would show

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.180
a greater effect or greater

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.180
return on the invested capital

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.840
through the net profit rate.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.000
And depending on what the company’

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.400
s financial strategy is

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.080
primarily focused on, that is,

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.780
if it is primarily focused on

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.180
the efficiency of current

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.460
activities and business activity,

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.320
when we need to form the infrastructure,

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.420
when we are focused, that only

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.460
in three years we will begin

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.300
to give information about

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.640
the efficiency of our business,

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.380
to give information about

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.240
the preparation of bond

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.040
loans or to go to

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.740
an IPO with our own corporate

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.920
securities, then in this

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.620
interim period of

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.000
time leasing is

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.500
advisable.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.660
In the event that we are already

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.860
acting as a public company,

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.260
which has a formed image on

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.080
the market, we focus on not using

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.540
leasing schemes, but focusing more

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.820
on attracting borrowed

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.640
capital and through purchasing

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.080
loans, equipment or basic acquisition

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.960
of them, we put them on balance,

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.180
increasing the size of non-

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.640
currency assets and start to

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.260
exploit them at lower costs,

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.520
since there are no leasing

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.020
payments, there is only debt service

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.600
and at the same time the entire

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.460
volume of revenue from sales

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:43.820
shows an increase or increase

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.400
in business activity, at

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.020
the same time with a lower

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.320
amount of cost to serve

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.560
this volume of business

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.380
activity.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.780
The fifth component indicator of capital

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.580
value in the segment of its individual

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.480
elements is used in the

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.360
process of managing the structure of

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.080
this capital on the basis of

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.380
the mechanism of financial leverage.

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.420
This is just one of the elements

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.620
of efficient capital management

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.120
in the company, which

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.320
is directly dealt with

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.500
by the financial manager,

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.160
the ratio of own capital and

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.240
borrowed capital that the

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.340
company uses.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.600
The essence of the financial

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.960
leverage is that if the company

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.240
with lower costs associated with

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.320
the maintenance of debt, receives

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.240
a greater amount of net profit

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.440
due to the exploitation of the

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.960
capital attracted, and the market situation

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.540
allows to increase the volume

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.200
of revenue from the sale, allows

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.660
to increase the volume

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.780
of production of products

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.280
or services provided, then

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.900
the effect of the financial

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.820
leverage is achieved.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.380
Or the reverse situation, when

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.520
the service of debt is greater

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.920
in cost than the effect of business

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.820
activity that the company receives

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.520
in the form of net profit, then the

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.400
effect of the financial leverage

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.780
does not work, and the main emphasis

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.400
or main emphasis of activity

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.540
in the role of the financial director

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.940
is concentrated precisely on

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.340
the management of own capital,

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.280
when through the optimization of

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.080
the turnover funds, when

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.360
through the reduction of costs

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.540
we are looking for reserves for

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.360
the more efficient operation of

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.960
the company's own capital.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.800
The following slide is a statement

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.700
regarding the value of the capital

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.900
of the enterprise.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.620
The level of capital value

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.460
is the most important measure

00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.560
of market value.

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.000
The value of capital is the criterion

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.720
for assessing and forming

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.500
the appropriate type of policy

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.200
of financing of the company’

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.400
s assets, first of all, of

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.180
course, operating assets.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.800
The financial director, considering

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.860
the management of the company's

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.960
liabilities, and this is own and borrowed

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.200
capital, primarily focuses on

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.740
the adequacy or balance of

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.740
own and borrowed capital, since

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.620
the amount of liabilities

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.260
of both own and borrowed

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.100
nature affects the financial

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.560
system.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.400
The financial stability and risks associated

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.300
with financial stability,

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.140
as borrowed capital must be served,

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.620
and this is relative to the efficiency

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.860
of operation, that is, when borrowed

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.780
capital, if it is used as an

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:52.760
attraction and additional

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.380
incentives, additional

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:58.340
increase in the operating assets

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.480
or operating funds that

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.700
are at the disposal of the company

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.900
provides attempts to compensate

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.220
for the cost of servicing

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.740
the claimed capital and

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.220
additional increase in the operating

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:16.600
assets that are at the disposal

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.460
of the company by the net profit

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.800
obtained precisely from the operation

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.460
of the claimed capital on the

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.380
next slide presented three main

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.220
factors affecting the market

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.660
value of the enterprise capital

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.400
of the company of the absolute

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.000
manager, having the task

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:37.200
of shareholders to increase

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.600
the value of the business,

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.100
aim primarily to generate

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.380
current profit in the amount

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.260
that is sufficient to pay

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.900
dividends and reinvest

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.780
It is very often the case that

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.200
shareholders set the task, in

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.620
addition to the amount of capital

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.760
consumed, to reach a state where

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.340
the company is able to re-invest

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.420
net profit in current

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.660
activity, close the entire investment

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.200
budget by its own.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.780
But at the same time, such cases

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.060
happen and there are not

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.600
very many in practice.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.820
The main limitation is,

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.920
of course, competitive

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.000
influence.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.740
Once such appear,

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.260
many are looking to repeat

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.340
success.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.780
And at the current moment,

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.720
a limited number of companies,

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.480
by reinvesting only in their

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.800
own profits, are able to

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.700
implement their strategy.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.620
Of course, additional sources

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.200
of financing are also

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.960
needed, primarily in the form

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.440
of borrowed capital.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.860
The second very large component of the

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.640
market value of capital of any enterprise

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.380
is, of course, the minimization of

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.300
the risk of activity and the structure

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.080
of the sources of funds.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.380
That is, what we talked about is

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.180
the ratio of equity and borrowed

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.800
capital, the managable of borrowed

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.340
capital, the ability of the enterprise

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.360
to stretch events in time to repay

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.860
a credit transaction, the art

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.440
of the financial director to prevent

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.320
the risks of cash breaks

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.020
in mind that one loan needs

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.720
to be given and the second has

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.560
not yet been received, that

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.660
is, all this is, of course,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.540
a risk zone for the company's

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.640
financial mechanism.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.180
The art of the financial director

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.980
is that he minimizes the risks

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.800
of the company’s activities as a

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.500
whole and reduces the dependence

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.880
on the structure of the sources

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.420
of funds that are at the disposal

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.460
of the company.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.620
And in the case when there is a

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.280
struggle for cost reduction,

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.260
tactically sometimes, let’

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.020
s say, within one calendar

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.720
year, everything looks great.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.360
The company pays off the loan and

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.540
the company pays interest in time.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.260
According to the results of the

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.100
work for the year, information

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.340
is that if we did not reduce

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.100
the size of the loan portfolio,

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.880
the amount of interest

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.860
charged and paid for the use of

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.520
loans would be the amount of

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.640
$ 5 million per year.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.020
But thanks to our policy of early

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.880
repayment or repayment and non-

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.360
renewal of loans, we have brought

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.460
this figure to 3 million

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.180
per year.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.960
It seems to be a $2 million

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.300
savings, that is a

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.840
tactical moment, the result.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.200
What happens next day

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.680
or next year?

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.280
Conditionally speaking, with the

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.120
start of the new financial year,

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.520
on January 2, 2008, suddenly

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.760
there is a problem related to

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.840
the fact that the company

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.760
urgently needs additional borrowing

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.280
for the extensive growth of the

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.180
company, in that production

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.320
platform at the same time the debt

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.440
market on which we work as a client

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.620
in terms of banks is not ready

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.380
to us quickly and not ready to

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.840
allocate the necessary amount

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.220
of resources within one banking

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.220
day, the meeting of the credit

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.540
committee in banks usually occurs

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.020
twice a month at the same time

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.260
without the decision of the

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.340
credit committee resources

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.140
are not determined, there are

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.720
certain limitations, that

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.400
is, the complexity of tasks

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.240
that the financial director

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.540
on capital management solves,

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.200
as soon as it is reduced to

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.160
a balanced policy, not

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.420
only to reduce costs, but

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.760
also to ensure continuity

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.940
of activity and avoid cash

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.800
breaks due to the lack

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.040
of debt volume bor

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.500
The task is complex, but the financial

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.960
director must think in

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.760
categories for more than

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.580
one financial year.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.380
The third, which constitutes the market

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.980
value of capital, the most important,

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.360
the most key and the most basic, is

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.880
the attraction of experienced

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.200
management personnel.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.540
And here it is important to note the following

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.720
that the financial economic services

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.540
of any company, including accounting services

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.500
related to accounting, they

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.900
are responsible for the effectiveness

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.400
of distribution.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.320
That is, everything about

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.400
savings, economy, everything

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.720
about turnover, but in no case

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.880
these services can affect the

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.840
business activity of the company.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.000
The most difficult function from a financial

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.360
point of view is the sales

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.840
function.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.280
Sales, which are supported, on the

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.040
one hand, by sufficient cash

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.860
flow, which means the volume of shipment

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.320
in the corresponding planned indicators,

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.080
at the same time the raw price level

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.840
for commodity products or services

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.200
provided by the company, which

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.060
would allow to compensate

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.880
for the company's costs and provide

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.160
a given level of profitability

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.000
of current activity.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.660
Of course, this can only

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.060
cope with experienced management

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.420
staff not only in the field

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.800
of finance, but also in the field

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.900
of commercial component

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.380
of any enterprise and including

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.940
marketing activities.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.700
Therefore, the market value of

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.840
the enterprise capital is qualitatively

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.620
mediated, but the maximum impact

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.160
is made by experienced management

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.240
personnel.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.140
The lack of experienced

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.220
management personnel, as one of

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.820
the elements or as one of the results

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.680
of inefficient cost management, when

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.940
we start to push expensive

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.760
professionals out, is that

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.980
a certain inertia time the company

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.760
works with good financial indicators,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.600
and, as a rule, such inertia

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.940
lasts from 3 to 6 months, and

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.400
then there is a very sharp decline,

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.360
which is precisely due to the

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.720
fact that experienced management

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.960
personnel have left the

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.440
company, and the remaining

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.620
simply do not have the organizational

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.320
and professional

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.640
experience of work that

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.640
was in the previous staff.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.440
There is no continuity of

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.520
personnel, but three to six months

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.480
we have fulfilled the task

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.500
in a non-thoughtful policy

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.120
to cut costs and cut the

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.920
total salary fund of personnel

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.080
by several percent.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080
At the same time, the risks that the

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.700
company carries due to such activities

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.180
are incomparably higher.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.960
And the consequences that can

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.040
be equated to financial losses are

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.060
incomparably greater than the losses

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.000
on the wage fund.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.800
The following slide presents the process

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.220
of creating the value of the

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.280
company's capital.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.360
We are talking about the

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.340
fact that implementation of successful

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.660
financial alternatives is the

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.540
main driving force in the process of

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.180
creating capital value of the enterprise.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.500
In this case, the financial

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.880
and economic services of the

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.800
company more resemble a creative

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.900
and creative group.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.740
In the event that the company

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.320
is oriented to extensive growth,

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.660
it is the financial

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.520
and economic function in the company

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.120
to regulate internal

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.580
processes begins to occupy

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.400
a dominant position.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.360
That is, when everything is stable,

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.940
the company develops within the

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.600
existing infrastructure, there

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.220
is no need for extensive growth,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.220
the role of financial and economic

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.800
services more effectively starts

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.760
when it timely, correctly,

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.720
accurately and fully reflects

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.220
the entire volume of operations.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.440
And many managers of companies

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.880
are beginning to limit financial

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.380
and economic services again, bringing

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.900
them to a common denominator, trying

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.380
to reduce the number of financial

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.920
and economic services and perform

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.520
other measures to optimize

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.560
the cost of these services.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.580
But once there is a problem associated

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.940
with extensive growth, with the increase

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.020
of responsibility centers,

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.620
with the emergence of new branches,

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.160
with the appearance of new organizational

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.720
units in the organizational

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.900
structures of the company,

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.280
we begin to understand that

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.480
the lack or insufficient qualification

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.600
level of financial and

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.940
economic specialists can play

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.240
a big damage or cause

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.760
a big loss to the company.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.560
That is, you need to get the current

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.840
management, there is no staff.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.580
And that is why, of course, within

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.600
the framework of capital management

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.980
and within the prospect of the company’

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.180
s market value growth,

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.380
we focus on unconditional growth,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.680
but at the same time we

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.340
argue that saving in this case

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:51.940
on the personnel components is

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:52.920
in no way possible.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.220
This also applies to the creative part of

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.400
the business, as regards the revenue indicators

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.100
from sales, sales and marketing

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.740
functions in the company.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.220
This also applies to the distribution

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.400
functions in the company, for which

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.220
the financial and economic

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.780
services are responsible.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.140
So, the scheme shows that, on the

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.800
one hand, we must act and function

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.880
effectively the system

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.840
of selection and making reasonable

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.500
investments of resources.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.700
They are defined by shareholders

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.500
as part of the company’s strategy,

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.780
and at the same time the manager

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.980
forms an investment budget

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.740
for the implementation

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.100
of the strategy.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.400
The choice and use of funding

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.700
sources must be careful.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.900
Here the area of responsibility

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.940
is shifted to the tactical level and

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.780
the financial and economic services

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.420
are conducting a policy

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.380
of diversification of resources related

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.660
to the borrowing market,

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.100
conducting measures to minimize

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.700
the cost of these resources, conducting

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.460
a event to restructure the credit

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.600
portfolio from the point of view

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:14.220
of serving banks and increasing

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.440
this amount, in terms of the distribution

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.800
of financial flows and the ability

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.300
to trade, if so, or to receive

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.900
large preferences from banks,

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.560
but at the same time 100%

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.560
fully fulfill their own

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.900
obligations to serve

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.640
the debts that are at

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.580
the disposal of

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.660
the company.

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.100
And the third element of

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.840
creating capital value of the

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.100
enterprise, of course, is the

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.500
use of resources to

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.540
conduct competitive and cost-

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.980
effective activities.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.860
These three blocks are the elements

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.080
of creating a reasonable market

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.640
value of capital.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.620
Very often there is a situation in

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.000
the market that some of the

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.060
competitors are extremely successful

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.940
in selling, extremely successful

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.460
and aggressively enter new markets,

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.820
attract new customers, but

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.660
at the same time a short

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.160
period of time, which can

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.100
change in a year, two years,

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.400
can occupy leading positions.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.900
But they are followed, say, second

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.120
in the line of those companies

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.600
that have very effective capital

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.380
management methods, those who are

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.560
creative and risk-free to

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.180
the sources of financing

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.680
of their activities, and these

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.420
companies choose the customer mass

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.040
of yesterday's leaders, giving

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.780
more effective offers on prices,

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.000
payment terms, on service.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.220
And customers, of course, choose what

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.460
is more advantageous for them in terms

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.120
of price, quality and service.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.480
Therefore, consideration of the prospect of the

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.740
three blocks of creating the value of the enterprise

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:09.940
capital within the framework

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.360
of the financial and economic policy

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.020
of any company is extremely important.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.960
The following slide shows the structure

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.940
of the company’s own capital.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.140
The structure of own capital consists

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.840
of five components.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.160
Three of the key ones we discussed are

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.660
related to the authorized capital, the

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.920
additional capital that is formed

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.480
from the revaluation in the company’

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.320
s non-exchangeable and operating

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.100
assets, and net profit.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.460
In addition, social targeted

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.180
financial funds can be allocated

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:43.160
in the structure of own capital,

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.920
which are also filled

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.140
with the net profit

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.820
received by the company.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.140
The so-called reserve funds, or

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.240
reserve capital, may be formed

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.900
for possible negative conditions.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.560
Negative events that

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.420
can be predicted or cannot

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.120
be predicted but may

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.580
occur.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.980
Or the so-called force majeure conditions.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.560
In the event of loss

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.180
of part of the property complex,

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.660
reserve funds may be required

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.060
to restore it.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.200
Losses can be related to both

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.160
natural disasters and, for

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.840
example, to the safety of individual

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.780
production processes.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.380
In addition, very often reserve funds

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.900
and the use of reserve funds are

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.180
associated with the interaction of

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.360
insurance companies, which receive

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.440
from the company’s reserve funds

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.280
payment for their insurance services,

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.760
but at the same time guarantees

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.980
the smooth functioning

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.100
of the company or a way out

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.880
with minimal loss in the

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.360
event of force majeure conditions.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.200
In addition, other forms of equity

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.100
are possible, which can be expressed

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.340
in various types of mutual

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.500
aid casinos.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:06.100
This is an effective and, let’

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.860
s say, grateful old legacy of

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.940
the Soviet economy.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:13.500
These can be various internal

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.680
funds in the company, which

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.520
have a targeted direction for both

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.720
consumption and accumulation.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.060
These can be funds for

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.280
the stubbing of young

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.860
employees, New-Okr funds, other components.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.880
Sources of the formation of own financial

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.700
resources are presented in the

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.440
following slide.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.520
There is a global classification of

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.020
the allocation of internal and external sources.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.800
We are talking about the fact that

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.800
from the inside, own capital is formed by

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.580
the profit that remains at the

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.120
disposal of the firm.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.800
Amortisation deduction

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.060
from the used assets

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.440
and intangible assets.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.820
And here I wanted to point out the following

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.840
specificity that in the West,

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.100
depreciation depreciation

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.480
is the main source of investment

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.380
investments From 45 to 50% on average,

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:13.400
according to experts, all

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.060
investments that exist in the

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.500
West are made at

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.300
the expense of depreciation.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.640
And we can give an example that

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.760
if we consider the Italian textile

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.280
or the Italian textile

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.020
industry, then entrepreneurs

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.020
working in the production

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.140
unit have the opportunity

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.440
to amortize the equipment

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.320
used 100% during the year.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.220
This is under the guarantee

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.960
that the funds saved by reducing

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.960
the taxable base on profit,

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.280
namely, by forming an amortisation

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.460
fund, will be directed

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.240
to purchase of new

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.440
equipment.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.360
And, of course, the Italians are the

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.440
leaders in the production

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.820
of textile equipment, at the

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.240
same time with the

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.880
entrepreneurs who are leading

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.840
the extensive growth of their companies,

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.640
who aggressively increase the

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.200
production of new products,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.940
new types of fabrics, including

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.600
seeking to modernize

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.220
the equipment fleet.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.420
The question is what happens to the

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.560
equipment that is discharged.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.460
The entrepreneur deals with

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.420
the newly acquired equipment with

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.060
the support of Italian banks,

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.600
the supported equipment through

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.540
export-purpose leasing

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.000
schemes is sent to Pakistan,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.100
India, China.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.260
For three to five years, this

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.980
equipment is operated there.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.440
It is clear that the degree of operation

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.900
and the degree of wear reaches the maximum.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.760
And after that, this equipment,

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.500
because it is virtually

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.320
nothing, or costs a limited

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.580
amount, or has a limited

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.980
price, this equipment

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.720
comes to Russia.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.520
It is not advisable to

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.440
say that Russian textile

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.380
companies, large

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.100
or small, can modernize

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.020
their own stock stock, because

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.320
it will be impossible

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.260
to produce a competitive

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:20.940
product that can be

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.360
exported for one simple

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.700
reason.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.220
The level of current repairs and the

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.960
impact of this volume on cost will

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.780
not allow to give a competitive price

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.040
for the relevant product in the foreign

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.500
markets.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.280
But depreciation deductions

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.360
should be accumulated in any company

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.740
and should not go to so-called

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.940
consumer funds.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.240
Very often companies charge amortization,

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.180
pay less income tax, and the

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:55.420
saved portions of resources

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.100
go simply to hidden consumption.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.780
Modernization of infrastructure, the

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.560
acquisition of new non-currency

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.760
assets does not occur.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.820
But other internal sources of

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.880
formation of own financial

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.260
resources are also treated

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.060
as a third component of internal

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.680
sources of formation of capital

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.740
in the company.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.620
The external sources.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.300
External, of course, relates to

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.740
attracting additional share

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.260
capital or equity capital.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.300
That is, when a decision is made by shareholders

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.100
or founders on increasing the authorized

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.960
capital and there is an increase

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.180
in shares or an increase

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:37.120
in the number of shares to be

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.920
bought for a certain nominal,

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.580
further mimicked.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.140
This means that the company receives

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.600
external sources of increased

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.000
own capital.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.960
Receiving a firm of free financial

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.220
assistance is usually considered

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.480
within the framework of

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.820
holding structures, as a rule, is

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.060
considered at the start stage.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.740
Other external sources

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.880
of the company’s own

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.380
financial resources.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.040
The following slide presents the classification

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.420
of the source of the

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:10.260
formation of the financial resources.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.620
In this case, there is a distinction

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.460
between long-term and short-term

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.360
sources and in terms of long-

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.080
term loans and financial obligations,

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.360
loans are allocated, the term of

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.780
which has not yet arrived and,

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.220
as a rule, the term of more than

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.840
a year, and in addition to loans,

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.640
there may be long-term loans, which

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.440
are provided by or in the

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.440
form of loans, by players of the

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.800
financial market, when there

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.660
are specialized companies representing

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:50.920
Sometimes these companies

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:56.020
buy out the issuance of

01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.520
bills, the issuer of

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.720
enterprises that need long-

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.320
term loans, and the repayment

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.540
period of bills can be

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.320
more than one year.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.380
A negative component can be in the

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.260
company when long-term loans and

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.120
loans are not repayed in due time.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.220
But at the same time, from a financial point

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.100
of view, it can be considered that it

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.960
is temporary, of course.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.320
The components are also

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.460
an element of long-term

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.040
loans and loans that are available

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.340
to the company.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.900
Short-term borrowing capital

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.640
is also formed from loans, banks

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.540
and borrowing funds.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.160
At the same time, it is possible

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.080
that there is a short-term

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.520
and short-term debt on loans and

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.820
loans, but here you need to make

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:51.800
such a comment in connection with

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.340
the start of the credit bureau, companies

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.580
have started to treat very carefully

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.860
and very effectively to

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.580
repay their own debt obligations.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.280
This also applies to interest payments, this

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.960
applies to the repayment of the principal

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.220
amounts or the principal body of the loan.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.100
This is due to the fact that the information

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.820
is entered into a centralized database,

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.240
and in the event of subsequent contact

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.740
with other banks, the company may

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.600
be refused to grant a

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.320
loan precisely because of the

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.600
violation of the obligations

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.080
to repay loans and loans.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.120
Also, one of the sources

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.920
of short-term capital loan

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.000
can be the credit debt

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.320
first of all to our suppliers,

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.280
when we can get a commodity

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.860
so-called credit, that is,

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.360
this is the supply of a line

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:52.100
of both annuity so-called

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.160
payments, equal parts, and

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.500
a saldo payment after a certain

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.160
period of time, let us say

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.640
there 6 months or 12

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.340
months.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.780
And in the event that the

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.940
so-called commodity credit

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.200
from our supplier is presented

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.800
at higher prices than the price

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.300
list for the current time

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.840
at which the supplier works.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.380
The supplier may also benefit

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.680
from cooperating with us

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.080
through this scheme.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.900
Other short-term financial liabilities

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.800
that may be at the disposal

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.080
of the company are short-term

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.800
borrowed capital and allow

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.680
the company to exploit borrowed

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.420
capital in its activities.

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.640
To classify borrowed funds that

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.340
come into the company in the form

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.680
of capital can be by the following

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.800
blocks.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.940
Well, first, on the whole attraction,

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:54.780
on the sources of attraction,

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.780
on the period of attraction,

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.940
on the form of attraction and on

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.020
the form of security.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.860
As for the form of security,

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.520
security must be under

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.160
those resources that we attract

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.820
from the outside, and as security

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.600
can be considered as collateral

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.920
of assets of the enterprise

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.160
itself, as well as collateral

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.900
of third parties or collateral

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.740
from third parties in

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:29.420
collateral of the

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.980
enterprise itself.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.280
Two aspects of the increase in capital

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.600
price must be identified.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.520
The slide presents the management

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.040
aspect, such as volume growth, sales,

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.380
and the financial aspect, such as

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:46.880
the growth of the company’s operating assets.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.420
As I said before, these two aspects

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.200
are constantly present in the strategy

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.140
of different companies,

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.680
but some might be at the forefront

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.420
of the corner, some, suppose,

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.560
financial aspect is often

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.420
considered a priority

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:07.100
for resale-oriented.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.800
In a traditional situation,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.720
the initiative groups of managers

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.140
may apply to the board of

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.440
directors to include in the

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.320
investment budget of any project,

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.280
focusing on the management

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.280
aspect, that is, on the growth

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.540
of sales.

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.080
At the same time, the board

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.840
of directors can adjust this

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.420
application and say, as

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.400
a example, we are willing to

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.060
allocate you $10 million to implement

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.140
the project, and we agree

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.260
that the net profit from the

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.280
project will be $3 million

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.080
in a year, but in addition,

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.380
still ensure that the market

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.960
value of the new business

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.220
that will be allocated to

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:53.540
a separate company

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.160
will be around $20 million

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.640
in the results of the

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.680
first year.

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:02.800
That is, it is a more complex task,

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.160
primarily from an organisational

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.820
point of view, but for shareholders

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:09.040
the financial aspect may be at

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.200
the top of the priority rather than

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.560
the management aspect.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.760
The growth of the company's

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.900
own capital is represented in the formula

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.920
as the ratio of profit divided by

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.760
the size of the own capital, minus

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.980
dividends, divided by the size of

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.120
the own capital, plus the

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.160
additional issue of shares

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.260
divided by the amount of the own capital.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.400
At the same time, the profitability

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.080
of own capital is calculated

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.400
as the division of profit to the total

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.960
amount of assets or the value

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.980
of the property complex that

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:46.980
is at the disposal of the

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:49.540
company, plus the difference

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:54.060
in the ratio of profit to assets

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:57.500
minus the interest that must

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.200
be paid for the service of borrowed

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.860
capital, to the amount of borrowed

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:03.220
capital, all this multiplied

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:07.380
by borrowed capital.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.940
The profitability of the company’s

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:13.520
assets is calculated as profit in

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.940
relation to revenue multiplied by revenue

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.500
divided by the amount of assets.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.820
What can be deployed and represented in

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.300
the formula is the profitability of sales

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.540
multiplied by the turnover of assets.

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.760
Regarding the main tasks that are set

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.500
before managers in the complex,

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.840
that is, regardless of their division

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.260
into a separate functional area

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.340
of responsibility, shareholders

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:43.840
place tasks precisely in the

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.260
intersection of these two aspects.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.040
These formulas can

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.960
be used as universal

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.040
for any type of business

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:59.000
and they are the

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.240
main on the basis

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.840
of which you can

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.380
determine the

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.820
quality of management

01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:13.210
in the company

01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:15.710
and accordingly

01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:20.050
determine the motivational

01:29:20.050 --> 01:29:23.350
component in the

01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:25.670
overall management

01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:26.950
team of the

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.110
enterprise.
