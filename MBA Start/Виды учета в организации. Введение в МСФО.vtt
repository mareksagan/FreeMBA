WEBVTT

00:05.040 --> 00:06.160
Hello.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.560
My name is Natalia Gavrielyovna Gorokhova.

00:10.600 --> 00:16.880
I am the Chief Consultant at the auditing consulting firm BDO Unicom.

00:18.080 --> 00:25.200
I am the Chief Specialist of our firm on accounting issues.

00:26.200 --> 00:35.200
Today we will discuss accounting, tax, management accounting,

00:35.200 --> 00:38.200
accounting, that is, financial accounting,

00:38.200 --> 00:44.200
and see what standards it can meet.

00:44.200 --> 00:50.200
The goal and purpose of our course is to show the importance,

00:50.200 --> 00:57.200
importance and interrelationship of all types of accounting in the organization

00:57.200 --> 01:06.200
and to introduce you to the foundations of international standards of financial accounting.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.200
Accounting

01:11.200 --> 01:21.200
We will start with the types of accounting and their interrelationship in the organization.

01:21.200 --> 01:28.200
Accounting is a language of knowledge and rules of their use.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.200
It is created to replace real objects with their symbols.

01:36.200 --> 01:43.200
These symbols allow to describe the economic activity and its results.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.200
The language of signs is a set of conditional designations,

01:49.200 --> 01:55.200
represented primarily by professional terminology and special codes.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.200
The rules of use are the restrictions introduced into the accounting language

02:01.200 --> 02:07.200
and which establish the informational connections between the signs,

02:07.200 --> 02:15.200
providing the necessary communication between the participants of the economic process.

02:16.200 --> 02:25.200
Accounting includes the collection, accumulation and storage of information about the objects of accounting.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.200
There are different types of accounting, as we have already said.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.200
This is the management accounting system,

02:33.200 --> 02:36.200
this is the tax accounting system,

02:36.200 --> 02:39.200
this is the financial accounting system,

02:39.200 --> 02:42.200
and this is the accounting system according to the standards of the Russian Federal Reserve,

02:42.200 --> 02:45.200
according to the standards of the Federal Reserve,

02:45.200 --> 02:51.200
maybe according to the standards of the US GAAP,

02:51.200 --> 02:57.200
and each accounting system gives us its own accountability.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.200
The management accounting system will give the management accountability,

03:03.200 --> 03:07.200
the tax accounting system will give us the tax accountability,

03:07.200 --> 03:12.200
the financial accounting system will give us the financial accountability.

03:12.200 --> 03:19.200
What is the reason for such a variety of accounting?

03:19.200 --> 03:27.200
It is explained by the fact that different tasks are set before the accounting accounting system.

03:27.200 --> 03:37.200
These tasks may be the task of controlling the use of purposeful means,

03:37.200 --> 03:42.200
it may be the requirements of the state statistics,

03:42.200 --> 03:48.200
it may be the requirements that are presented by the market of securities,

03:48.200 --> 03:52.200
it may be macroeconomic regulation,

03:52.200 --> 03:56.200
it may be the resolution of civil and legal disputes,

03:56.200 --> 04:00.200
it may be the division of property during reorganization,

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
it may be the calculation of taxes and tax administration,

04:04.200 --> 04:14.200
it may be information about the financial situation and the financial results of the organization.

04:15.200 --> 04:25.200
All this variety of accounting is caused by the fact that different users need different information.

04:25.200 --> 04:32.200
All users can be divided into internal users and external users.

04:32.200 --> 04:41.200
When we talk about internal users, we mean that this is about the owners of the enterprise,

04:41.200 --> 04:47.200
this is the members of the board of directors, this is the administration, managers,

04:47.200 --> 04:50.200
this is the line managers.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.200
They need all the information,

04:54.200 --> 05:02.200
both tax information, management information and financial accounting.

05:02.200 --> 05:09.200
External users are divided into users with indirect financial interest

05:09.200 --> 05:13.200
and with direct financial interest.

05:13.200 --> 05:18.200
With indirect financial interest, this is the local administration,

05:18.200 --> 05:23.200
which is interested in whether the enterprise will work tomorrow,

05:23.200 --> 05:31.200
how much labor it can do, what taxes it will pay.

05:31.200 --> 05:38.200
These are tax authorities that may require any information.

05:38.200 --> 05:46.200
But they are primarily interested in the correct calculation and payment of taxes to the budget.

05:46.200 --> 05:55.200
These are statistical authorities that will be interested in purely statistical information.

05:56.200 --> 06:07.200
These are buyers who will be interested in the financial accounting of the organization.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.200
Users with direct financial interest are investors,

06:13.200 --> 06:18.200
investors of today, future investors.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.200
These are creditors, these are suppliers.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.200
They are interested in financial information.

06:28.200 --> 06:39.200
The general information base for the composition of financial, management and tax accounting registers

06:39.200 --> 06:44.200
is the primary accounting document, the accounting book.

06:44.200 --> 06:49.200
In various types of financial, management and tax registers,

06:49.200 --> 06:58.200
this information is grouped according to the tasks of each type of accounting.

06:58.200 --> 07:05.200
The area of cross-referencing of financial, management and tax accounting

07:05.200 --> 07:10.200
is the determination and distribution of expenses,

07:10.200 --> 07:13.200
calculation of the cost of the finished product,

07:13.200 --> 07:18.200
the cost of the unfinished product, and so on.

07:18.200 --> 07:28.200
Financial, management and tax accounting are interconnected subsystems of a single accounting.

07:29.200 --> 07:43.200
The register of financial accounting and, accordingly, financial accounting is created on the basis of the primary accounting document.

07:43.200 --> 07:48.200
The register of management accounting and, accordingly, accounting,

07:48.200 --> 07:55.200
approved by the organization for the generalization of management accounting data,

07:55.200 --> 08:04.200
the register of tax accounting allows us to make tax declarations.

08:06.200 --> 08:12.200
Management accounting is a subsystem of accounting,

08:12.200 --> 08:18.200
which within the framework of one organization provides its apparatus with information

08:18.200 --> 08:25.200
used for planning, management and control of the organization's activities.

08:25.200 --> 08:31.200
This process includes the detection, measurement, collection, analysis, preparation,

08:31.200 --> 08:38.200
interpretation, transfer and reception of information to the necessary management apparatus

08:38.200 --> 08:41.200
for its function.

08:42.200 --> 08:49.200
The organization of management accounting is the internal affair of each enterprise.

08:49.200 --> 08:56.200
The state does not prescribe the common rules for the management accounting.

08:56.200 --> 09:05.200
Management independently determines in which sections to classify the management objects

09:05.200 --> 09:09.200
and how to carry out their accounting.

09:09.200 --> 09:18.200
Management accounting information is intended for the management and managers of the enterprise.

09:18.200 --> 09:26.200
It is a commercial secret and has a strictly confidential nature.

09:28.200 --> 09:37.200
The main objects of management accounting are expenses, costs, costs and revenues of the enterprise,

09:37.200 --> 09:46.200
as well as the results of the enterprise's work as a comparison of the enterprise's income and expenses.

09:46.200 --> 09:57.200
Such accounting objects as the centers of responsibility and the internal accounting system are always allocated.

09:59.200 --> 10:04.200
The methods used in management accounting are very diverse,

10:04.200 --> 10:09.200
as it combines the methods of many disciplines.

10:09.200 --> 10:17.200
This includes both operational accounting, accounting accounting, statistical accounting,

10:17.200 --> 10:30.200
analysis of strategic and operational planning, management of the enterprise's economy, statistics, mathematics.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.200
The growth of the scale of business, changes in technology,

10:36.200 --> 10:43.200
as well as the increase in the educational level of managers over the past decade

10:43.200 --> 10:47.200
have activated the development of management accounting

10:47.200 --> 10:55.200
and led to its wide recognition as a separate area of accounting, different from financial accounting.

10:55.200 --> 11:05.200
The goal of management accounting is to help managers make effective management decisions.

11:05.200 --> 11:09.200
It is realized in its tasks.

11:09.200 --> 11:19.200
This is the formation of reliable and complete information about the internal economic processes and the results of the activity.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.200
The presentation of this information is given by the enterprise's management

11:24.200 --> 11:29.200
by the internal management accounting.

11:29.200 --> 11:39.200
This is planning and control of the enterprise's economic efficiency and its centers of responsibility.

11:39.200 --> 11:45.200
This is the calculation of the actual cost of the product, work and services,

11:45.200 --> 11:51.200
the determination of deviations from management standards, standards, standards,

11:51.200 --> 11:55.200
the analysis of deviations from the planned results,

11:55.200 --> 11:59.200
the determination of the causes of these deviations,

11:59.200 --> 12:07.200
the control over the presence and movement of the property of material, financial, labor resources.

12:07.200 --> 12:12.200
This is the formation of an information base for decision-making.

12:12.200 --> 12:20.200
This is the realization of the reserves of increasing the efficiency of the enterprise's activities.

12:20.200 --> 12:28.200
Management influences are realized by means of the main functions of management,

12:28.200 --> 12:38.200
the interconnection and interaction of which form a closed, repeating, cyclical circle of management.

12:39.200 --> 12:48.200
This is planning, organization, accounting, control, regulation, analysis,

12:48.200 --> 12:53.200
and again planning, organization, accounting, and so on.

12:53.200 --> 13:03.200
Government accounting is a system of accounting, planning, control, analysis of income and expenses

13:03.200 --> 13:06.200
and the results of the organization's activities,

13:06.200 --> 13:15.200
in the necessary analytical sections of the operational acceptance of various management decisions.

13:15.200 --> 13:21.200
A specialist in management accounting for the execution of its functions

13:21.200 --> 13:28.200
must possess all the information, including confidential information.

13:28.200 --> 13:37.200
It must have the right to prepare its own special opinion with analytical, justified statements.

13:37.200 --> 13:44.200
It must have the right to postpone the decision-making in order to professionally prepare it.

13:44.200 --> 13:52.200
Tax accounting is carried out in strict accordance with the Tax Code.

13:53.200 --> 14:00.200
Tax accounting is a system of information generalization for determining the tax base

14:00.200 --> 14:04.200
on the basis of the data of primary documents,

14:04.200 --> 14:10.200
grouped in accordance with the order provided by the Tax Code.

14:10.200 --> 14:17.200
Tax accounting is carried out in order to form complete and reliable information

14:17.200 --> 14:23.200
on the order of accounting for the purpose of taxing economic operations

14:23.200 --> 14:28.200
carried out by taxpayers during the accounting period,

14:28.200 --> 14:34.200
as well as to provide information to internal and external users

14:34.200 --> 14:38.200
for the control of the correctness of the calculation,

14:38.200 --> 14:44.200
completeness and timeliness of the calculation, and payment of taxes to the budget.

14:44.200 --> 14:54.200
Tax accounting does not perform the functions of collecting and registering information on the facts of economic activity.

14:54.200 --> 15:00.200
These operations remain in the accounting knowledge.

15:00.200 --> 15:07.200
Subsequent processing of the collected information in order to calculate the tax base

15:07.200 --> 15:10.200
constitutes the subject of tax accounting.

15:10.200 --> 15:17.200
Tax accounting is based on the system of primary accounting

15:17.200 --> 15:25.200
and on the way of registering the facts of economic activity provided by accounting.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.200
But it can also introduce its own primary documents,

15:30.200 --> 15:34.200
such as invoices.

15:34.200 --> 15:40.200
Tax accounting involves the application of tax registers,

15:40.200 --> 15:45.200
in which information is generalized.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.200
In order to calculate, for example, the added cost of taxes,

15:49.200 --> 15:56.200
two special registers are formed – the purchase book and the sale book.

15:56.200 --> 16:01.200
The forms of these registers are set up by law.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.200
In order to calculate the tax revenue,

16:04.200 --> 16:12.200
the organization develops the system of tax registers and their composition on its own,

16:12.200 --> 16:19.200
based on the principle of consistency of the application of the norms and rules of tax accounting.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.200
That is, the system of registers is applied in a sequence,

16:23.200 --> 16:28.200
from one tax period to another tax period.

16:28.200 --> 16:34.200
The order of tax accounting is established by the tax payer

16:34.200 --> 16:39.200
in the accounting policy for the purposes of tax deductions.

16:39.200 --> 16:46.200
Financial accounting is designed for the characteristics of the financial situation

16:46.200 --> 16:49.200
and the results of financial activity.

16:49.200 --> 16:55.200
The definition of the economic effectiveness of the enterprise's activities

16:55.200 --> 17:02.200
In financial accounting, information is formed about the income and expenses of the organization,

17:02.200 --> 17:08.200
about the libidin and credit debt, about financial investments,

17:08.200 --> 17:12.200
about the state of the financing sources,

17:12.200 --> 17:16.200
about the relationship with the state on the payment of taxes.

17:16.200 --> 17:23.200
The goal of financial accounting is to provide information about the financial situation,

17:23.200 --> 17:29.200
the results of activities and about the changes in the financial situation of the company.

17:29.200 --> 17:38.200
The financial situation of the company gives us a balance of this company.

17:40.200 --> 17:46.200
Information about the results of activities gives us a report on profits and losses.

17:46.200 --> 17:53.200
The financial situation of the company gives us separate reports.

17:53.200 --> 18:00.200
A report on capital changes, a report on the movement of money.

18:00.200 --> 18:07.200
Financial accounting shows the results of the company's management activities,

18:08.200 --> 18:19.200
as well as all the necessary information for decision-making.

18:21.200 --> 18:28.200
To make economic decisions, it is necessary to assess the ability of the enterprise

18:28.200 --> 18:35.200
to generate cash flows, deadlines and the definition of their generation,

18:35.200 --> 18:39.200
information about the results of profitability,

18:39.200 --> 18:45.200
we need to assess the potential changes in the controlled resources,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.200
the forecast of the generated cash flows,

18:48.200 --> 18:52.200
the effectiveness of the use of additional resources.

18:52.200 --> 18:59.200
Consumers, mainly external to the enterprise,

19:00.200 --> 19:05.200
are the tax authorities, banks, exchanges, other financial institutions,

19:05.200 --> 19:13.200
as well as suppliers, buyers, potential and real investors, employees of the enterprise.

19:13.200 --> 19:23.200
Financial accounting must be assured by an independent auditor or audit firm.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.200
Financial accounting is public.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.200
It is intended for publication.

19:32.200 --> 19:45.200
The publicity of individual accounting becomes a kind of advertising of the company's activities.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.200
Companies make colorful booklets,

19:49.200 --> 19:53.200
where they provide their reports,

19:53.200 --> 19:58.200
provide information about the company's activities,

19:58.200 --> 20:02.200
post open information on the Internet,

20:02.200 --> 20:06.200
publish it in special publications.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.200
Financial accounting

20:26.200 --> 20:36.200
All financial information is made up of standards.

20:37.200 --> 20:46.200
Standards can be national or international.

20:50.200 --> 20:56.200
The goal of the standards is to provide users with reliable,

20:56.200 --> 21:00.200
accessible information about the financial situation

21:00.200 --> 21:04.200
and the results of the company's financial activities

21:04.200 --> 21:08.200
that are useful for making economic decisions.

21:10.200 --> 21:16.200
We often come across the English abbreviation GAAP,

21:16.200 --> 21:21.200
especially when it is written as USA.

21:22.200 --> 21:31.200
We think that it refers only to the standards in the United States.

21:31.200 --> 21:40.200
No, GAAP is translated from English as the General Principles of Accounting.

21:40.200 --> 21:45.200
GAAP is a system of rules, requirements,

21:45.200 --> 21:49.200
and practices of financial accounting

21:49.200 --> 21:54.200
that are adopted and applied in a certain jurisdiction.

21:54.200 --> 22:00.200
The designation of a state before the abbreviation

22:00.200 --> 22:04.200
defines this jurisdiction.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.200
The composition and representation of financial accounting

22:11.200 --> 22:18.200
by any country is regulated by a set of standards.

22:18.200 --> 22:23.200
The system of national accounting standards

22:23.200 --> 22:28.200
is developed by special organizations,

22:28.200 --> 22:32.200
based on theoretical research,

22:32.200 --> 22:39.200
and is mandatory for the country's level of performance.

22:39.200 --> 22:44.200
The system of national accounting standards

22:44.200 --> 22:49.200
is regulated by the government's laws,

22:49.200 --> 22:54.200
regulations, and directives.

22:54.200 --> 22:59.200
It defines the methods of accounting

22:59.200 --> 23:04.200
and the evaluation of the production of stocks and other material values.

23:04.200 --> 23:09.200
It regulates the amortization of foreign assets,

23:09.200 --> 23:14.200
regulates accounting forms and indicators,

23:14.200 --> 23:19.200
defines external methods of controlling the company's activities,

23:19.200 --> 23:24.200
contains the national accounting plan,

23:24.200 --> 23:29.200
and provides the user with sufficient information

23:29.200 --> 23:34.200
to make decisions at the micro and macro levels.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.200
The national standards can be

23:38.200 --> 23:41.200
the GAAP of the USA, the GAAP of the UK,

23:41.200 --> 23:44.200
the GAAP of Germany, the GAAP of France,

23:44.200 --> 23:49.200
the GAAP of Russia, the GAAP of any country.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.200
In addition to national standards,

23:53.200 --> 23:57.200
regional standards are developed,

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
which are mandatory for all members

24:01.200 --> 24:05.200
of the region.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.200
For example, the EU directives

24:08.200 --> 24:12.200
and other regional standards.

24:14.200 --> 24:20.200
If we look at the national standards of certain countries,

24:21.200 --> 24:26.200
we will notice that all countries

24:26.200 --> 24:31.200
can approach the reflection of certain assets,

24:31.200 --> 24:34.200
obligations in different ways.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.200
For example, in Denmark, Spain, Russia, France,

24:38.200 --> 24:41.200
and in a number of other countries,

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
the main funds are taken into account

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
according to the initial cost.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.200
In the UK, the main funds are taken into account

24:50.200 --> 24:53.200
according to the initial cost or the market cost.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.200
In Belgium, the main funds are taken into account

24:56.200 --> 25:02.200
according to the initial cost or the market cost.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.200
The revaluation of the main funds, for example,

25:05.200 --> 25:12.200
is not applied in the USA, Luxembourg, Japan,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.200
and a number of other countries,

25:14.200 --> 25:17.200
but is either done in a series of steps

25:17.200 --> 25:23.200
by the government bodies in Greece, Spain, and Italy,

25:23.200 --> 25:26.200
or is a permanent practice,

25:26.200 --> 25:29.200
as in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands,

25:29.200 --> 25:32.200
Russia, France, and Sweden.

25:32.200 --> 25:36.200
The revaluation can cover various periods.

25:36.200 --> 25:41.200
For example, in the UK, real estate is revalued

25:41.200 --> 25:44.200
no less than once every five years.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.200
In Denmark, every six months,

25:47.200 --> 25:50.200
the conditions and terms of amortization

25:50.200 --> 25:54.200
of non-returnable assets are changed.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.200
That is, the main funds, non-material assets.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.200
For example, the term of amortization

26:00.200 --> 26:04.200
of the business reputation in Belgium is five years.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.200
In the Netherlands, it is ten years.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.200
In Russia and France, it is twenty years.

26:12.200 --> 26:17.200
In the UK, the full calculation of its value

26:17.200 --> 26:21.200
and the funds of the previously listed reserves

26:21.200 --> 26:24.200
is carried out immediately.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.200
As a result, the incompatibility of indicators

26:28.200 --> 26:31.200
of various national systems.

26:32.200 --> 26:38.200
Thus, the income for the share of one Russian enterprise

26:38.200 --> 26:42.200
calculated according to the national accounting standards

26:42.200 --> 26:45.200
of the UK, Germany, and France

26:45.200 --> 26:50.200
was 6, 3, and 4 dollars.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.200
Three systems are highlighted.

26:53.200 --> 26:58.200
This is the Anglo-American financial accounting model.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.200
This is the continental model.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.200
And this is the Latin American model.

27:05.200 --> 27:10.200
The Anglo-American model combines the accounting systems

27:10.200 --> 27:17.200
of the countries that used to be part of the British Commonwealth.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.200
These are Australia, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Israel,

27:21.200 --> 27:26.200
India, Canada, Cyprus, Netherlands, USA, and some other countries.

27:29.200 --> 27:34.200
The continental model combines the national accounting systems

27:34.200 --> 27:39.200
of such countries as Germany, Austria, Belgium, Greece,

27:39.200 --> 27:44.200
Denmark, Spain, France, Switzerland, and Sweden.

27:44.200 --> 27:48.200
The national accounting system in Russia and Japan

27:48.200 --> 27:52.200
is close to this model.

27:52.200 --> 27:58.200
The Latin American model combines the national accounting systems

27:58.200 --> 28:03.200
of the countries of South America in terms of language

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
and in terms of the common past.

28:08.200 --> 28:13.200
In all the countries that are part of the Anglo-American model,

28:13.200 --> 28:18.200
the USA and Great Britain have a great influence.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.200
The accounting practices of the countries

28:22.200 --> 28:25.200
that are part of the continental model

28:25.200 --> 28:28.200
are significantly different from each other.

28:28.200 --> 28:33.200
A distinctive feature of the accounting system of the countries

28:33.200 --> 28:38.200
that are part of the Latin American model

28:38.200 --> 28:42.200
is the adjustment to inflation.

28:42.200 --> 28:47.200
The Anglo-American model assumes

28:47.200 --> 28:54.200
that the market for securities is well developed in these countries.

28:54.200 --> 28:59.200
This is why there is a high level of professionalism

28:59.200 --> 29:04.200
in the accounting system of both accountants and users.

29:04.200 --> 29:08.200
The accounting system is primarily aimed

29:09.200 --> 29:13.200
at the needs of investors and creditors.

29:13.200 --> 29:18.200
In the countries that use the continental model,

29:18.200 --> 29:22.200
business has a close relationship with banks.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.200
The orientation of financial accounting

29:26.200 --> 29:32.200
to the needs of investors is not a priority here.

29:32.200 --> 29:39.200
In the countries that use the Latin American model,

29:39.200 --> 29:43.200
accounting is generally oriented to the needs

29:43.200 --> 29:46.200
of state and tax authorities.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.200
There is strict control in these countries

29:50.200 --> 29:53.200
over the implementation of tax policy.

29:53.200 --> 29:57.200
The Anglo-American model is particularly important

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
in calculating the real financial result.

30:01.200 --> 30:06.200
The task of providing information to the state

30:06.200 --> 30:09.200
in the face of tax authorities

30:09.200 --> 30:13.200
is generally carried out within the framework of financial accounting

30:13.200 --> 30:16.200
and financial reporting.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.200
In the continental accounting model,

30:20.200 --> 30:24.200
accounting is regulated by law,

30:24.200 --> 30:28.200
differs in a large degree from conservatism,

30:28.200 --> 30:33.200
and the state's interference in accounting

30:33.200 --> 30:38.200
is usually a requirement for the use of accounts.

30:38.200 --> 30:43.200
Accounting is oriented to the satisfaction

30:43.200 --> 30:52.200
of information needs of tax and other state authorities.

30:53.200 --> 31:03.200
The Latin American model uses accounting methods

31:03.200 --> 31:11.200
that have a high level of unification.

31:11.200 --> 31:16.200
National Standards

31:16.200 --> 31:22.200
As we have seen, national standards are very diverse

31:22.200 --> 31:29.200
and sometimes provide incomparable information.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.200
Such a variety of national standards

31:33.200 --> 31:38.200
has caused a need for the preparation

31:38.200 --> 31:43.200
of international standards on financial accounting

31:43.200 --> 31:46.200
in the same standards.

31:46.200 --> 31:50.200
Here, the object of standardization

31:50.200 --> 31:54.200
is not accounting in general,

31:54.200 --> 32:00.200
but preparation and presentation of financial accounting.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.200
We are talking about external accounting,

32:05.200 --> 32:09.200
general accounting,

32:09.200 --> 32:14.200
accounting used by shareholders,

32:14.200 --> 32:19.200
creditors, clients, workers, and the public.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.200
Special financial accounting,

32:22.200 --> 32:25.200
such as commission and tax accounting,

32:25.200 --> 32:31.200
are not considered international standards.

32:31.200 --> 32:36.200
Today, there is a global accounting system

32:36.200 --> 32:40.200
based on international standards.

32:40.200 --> 32:45.200
Since 1983, the International Standards Committee

32:45.200 --> 32:49.200
of the Financial Accounting has been working in London.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.200
It is an independent body

32:52.200 --> 32:58.200
whose goal is to unify accounting principles

32:58.200 --> 33:02.200
used by companies around the world

33:02.200 --> 33:06.200
for financial accounting.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.200
By the end of the 20th century,

33:09.200 --> 33:14.200
more than 100 countries were represented

33:14.200 --> 33:19.200
in the International Standards Committee.

33:19.200 --> 33:24.200
Today, international standards are used

33:24.200 --> 33:28.200
as a basis for national requirements

33:28.200 --> 33:31.200
for financial accounting in many countries,

33:31.200 --> 33:36.200
as an international standard for those countries

33:36.200 --> 33:41.200
that develop their own requirements for accounting,

33:41.200 --> 33:45.200
including the main developed countries,

33:45.200 --> 33:48.200
the remaining number of new markets,

33:48.200 --> 33:53.200
such as China, Asian countries, Central Europe,

33:53.200 --> 33:56.200
Russia, and the CIS countries.

33:56.200 --> 34:01.200
Third, transnational corporations are used

34:01.200 --> 34:05.200
to make their own accounting.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.200
Fourth, fund exchanges

34:08.200 --> 34:12.200
requiring foreign and national companies

34:12.200 --> 34:17.200
to provide financial reports in compliance with the International Standards Committee

34:17.200 --> 34:22.200
are also used by regional organizations,

34:22.200 --> 34:25.200
such as the European Commission,

34:25.200 --> 34:30.200
which in 1995 announced

34:30.200 --> 34:35.200
that it relies on the International Standards Committee

34:35.200 --> 34:41.200
to prepare documents reflecting the needs of the capital market.

34:41.200 --> 34:46.200
International standards are also used

34:46.200 --> 34:49.200
by all economic entities,

34:49.200 --> 34:53.200
such as large corporations, holdings,

34:53.200 --> 34:57.200
that have foreign capital.

34:57.200 --> 35:02.200
The International Standards Committee is the most important element

35:02.200 --> 35:06.200
of modern corporate governance.

35:06.200 --> 35:12.200
It is the basis for timely, objective information

35:12.200 --> 35:17.200
for all interested users.

35:17.200 --> 35:23.200
Why is it necessary and necessary to use the International Standards Committee?

35:23.200 --> 35:28.200
The main reason is that the International Standards Committee,

35:28.200 --> 35:34.200
even in its formation of accounting in compliance with the International Standards Committee,

35:34.200 --> 35:39.200
allows companies to join the capital market.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.200
Capital in the face of investors requires

35:43.200 --> 35:47.200
the company to be open, transparent,

35:47.200 --> 35:52.200
and accountable to investors.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
If an investor is deprived of the opportunity

35:56.200 --> 35:59.200
to monitor the use of capital invested in a company

35:59.200 --> 36:03.200
with the help of financial accountability,

36:03.200 --> 36:06.200
such a company will always remain

36:06.200 --> 36:10.200
an area of increased risk for the investor

36:10.200 --> 36:14.200
and, accordingly, will always lose

36:14.200 --> 36:17.200
compared to other companies

36:17.200 --> 36:22.200
in attracting financial resources from the capital market.

36:22.200 --> 36:27.200
If a company does not have the accountability required,

36:27.200 --> 36:30.200
then from the investor's point of view

36:30.200 --> 36:33.200
it does not deserve trust

36:33.200 --> 36:36.200
and cannot be competitively capable

36:36.200 --> 36:40.200
on par with other capital seekers.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.200
Financial accountability formed in compliance with the International Standards Committee

36:44.200 --> 36:50.200
is distinguished by high informativeness and usefulness for the user.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.200
The use of the International Standards Committee

36:53.200 --> 36:57.200
allows to significantly reduce the time and resources

36:57.200 --> 37:00.200
required to develop national standards.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.200
Active use of the International Standards Committee

37:03.200 --> 37:07.200
also creates the basis for increasing the prestige

37:07.200 --> 37:11.200
and significance of the accounting profession.

37:11.200 --> 37:15.200
The first question about the use of the International Standards Committee

37:15.200 --> 37:18.200
in the composition of the Russian accounting

37:18.200 --> 37:21.200
was posed in 1992.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.200
Among the first companies to use the International Standards Committee

37:25.200 --> 37:30.200
were AvtoVAZ, which prepared the report on the International Standards Committee

37:30.200 --> 37:33.200
already in 1994,

37:33.200 --> 37:41.200
Gazprom, which went on the London Stock Exchange already in 1996,

37:41.200 --> 37:44.200
as well as large oil companies.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.200
Similar processes were carried out in the banking sector,

37:49.200 --> 37:54.200
where cooperation with any Western financial institution

37:54.200 --> 38:01.200
was impossible without the report on the International Standards Committee.

38:01.200 --> 38:07.200
The reform of accounting in Russia

38:07.200 --> 38:15.200
was almost simultaneously related to the transition to market relations.

38:15.200 --> 38:22.200
Theoretically, there are two main ways to implement the International Standards Committee.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.200
The first is the method of shock therapy,

38:25.200 --> 38:36.200
which is to give the status of the forces of the acts of national legislation to the international standards.

38:36.200 --> 38:44.200
This is the way Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Estonia,

38:44.200 --> 38:49.200
or the method of planned promotion,

38:49.200 --> 38:55.200
where the development of national standards is carried out,

38:55.200 --> 39:02.200
which is based on international standards of financial accounting,

39:02.200 --> 39:07.200
borrowing significant parts of the principles

39:07.200 --> 39:13.200
and changing existing national standards,

39:13.200 --> 39:21.200
as well as transferring most of the principles of international standards to national standards.

39:21.200 --> 39:29.200
Russia chose the most rational way of applying international financial reports.

39:29.200 --> 39:34.200
This is their adaptation,

39:35.200 --> 39:43.200
that is, gradually improving Russian rules of accounting and reporting.

39:43.200 --> 39:48.200
This method of implementing international standards

39:48.200 --> 39:53.200
corresponds to the approach of most European countries.

39:53.200 --> 39:57.200
The order of the Russian Ministry of Finance

39:58.200 --> 40:10.200
In 2004, the concept of developing accounting and accounting reporting in the Russian Federation

40:10.200 --> 40:18.200
was approved for the medium-term, which covers the period up to 2010.

40:19.200 --> 40:28.200
The goal of this concept is to activate the use of MSFO in the process of reforming national accounting.

40:28.200 --> 40:38.200
At the same time, the concept does not provide for forcing the introduction of MSFO into national practice

40:38.200 --> 40:49.200
and the complete replacement of the national accounting standards for international standards in the medium term.

40:49.200 --> 40:55.200
The danger of such forcing is noted,

40:55.200 --> 41:03.200
since any changes in accounting and reporting

41:03.200 --> 41:08.200
that occur outside of the economic mechanism

41:08.200 --> 41:14.200
can lead to a decrease in the quality of financial information,

41:14.200 --> 41:23.200
discrediting international standards of financial accounting and weakening of the financial discipline.

41:23.200 --> 41:28.200
Changes should occur gradually, taking into account the opportunities,

41:28.200 --> 41:37.200
needs, and, most importantly, readiness of the professional community and state authorities,

41:37.200 --> 41:47.200
which may take a significant amount of time to process new methods and information collection procedures.

41:47.200 --> 41:53.200
Today, there are two legally significant documents

41:53.200 --> 42:04.200
that establish the duty of certain economic entities to form accounting according to the principles of MSFO.

42:04.200 --> 42:14.200
These are the instructions of the Central Bank on the composition and presentation of financial accounting to credit organizations.

42:14.200 --> 42:27.200
These documents establish the duty of the credit organization to compose and present financial accounting according to international standards,

42:27.200 --> 42:34.200
starting with accounting for 9 months in 2004,

42:35.200 --> 42:48.200
in accordance with the methodological recommendations on the order of composing and providing financial accounting to credit organizations.

42:48.200 --> 42:55.200
The second document is the order of the Federal Service on Finance and Markets

42:55.200 --> 43:02.200
on the approval of the position of activity on the organization of trading on the market of securities.

43:03.200 --> 43:13.200
This document, as one of the mandatory conditions for entering the A-1 level of the credit rating list,

43:13.200 --> 43:21.200
establishes the duty of the emissary to have a financial report,

43:21.200 --> 43:31.200
a financial report, either in accordance with MSFO or in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Service on Finance and Markets,

43:31.200 --> 43:45.200
as well as the obligation to the emissary to disclose the report, along with the audit report, in Russian.

43:45.200 --> 43:57.200
By the beginning of the 21st century, more than 40 standards were approved by the Committee on International Standards of Financial Accounting.

43:57.200 --> 44:06.200
Some of them were adopted during the existence of 2-3 editorial offices,

44:06.200 --> 44:13.200
and some of them were so modified that they even had to change their names.

44:13.200 --> 44:22.200
The oldest of them is in the editorial office of 1992.

44:22.200 --> 44:29.200
It is necessary to remember that MSFO is a constantly updated,

44:29.200 --> 44:34.200
live system of regulatory regulation of accounting worldwide.

44:35.200 --> 44:40.200
At present, more than 40,000 transnational corporations,

44:40.200 --> 44:48.200
which have more than 200,000 subsidiary and dependent companies around the world,

44:48.200 --> 44:55.200
are voluntarily making financial reports in full accordance with MSFO.

44:55.200 --> 45:10.200
The European Commission has stated that it considers international standards as a suitable basis for harmonization of financial reporting within the EU.

45:10.200 --> 45:22.200
International Standards of Financial Reporting are developed and adopted by the Committee on International Standards of Financial Reporting,

45:22.200 --> 45:31.200
which unites 105 countries, which includes 143 members and more than 2 million accountants and auditors.

45:31.200 --> 45:43.200
The Committee on International Standards of Financial Reporting has copyrights on international standards, preliminary projects and other publications of the Committee.

45:44.200 --> 45:51.200
The published text of the Committee's reports is considered to be in English.

45:51.200 --> 45:57.200
There are official translations into Spanish, German, Polish and Russian.

45:57.200 --> 46:03.200
They are officially translated into more than 30 languages.

46:03.200 --> 46:20.200
The Committee's income consists of sales of publications, as well as financial support for professional associations, which are members of it, other companies and organizations.

46:20.200 --> 46:40.200
The Committee's work order in international standards of financial reporting is determined by the government appointed by the International Accounting Federation.

46:40.200 --> 46:53.200
The Committee includes up to four representatives from international organizations interested in financial reporting.

46:53.200 --> 47:03.200
Each member of the Committee can appoint two representatives and one advisor to participate in the meetings.

47:03.200 --> 47:10.200
The Government approves the new standards and their specified editorial offices.

47:10.200 --> 47:27.200
Representatives of the Government, organizations included in the International Accounting Federation and other legal and physical persons interested can send proposals on new topics that deserve attention.

47:27.200 --> 47:52.200
In 1981, the Government approved the International Consultative Group, which included representatives of international organizations, members and users of financial reporting, fund exchanges, and organizations regulating the circulation of securities.

47:52.200 --> 48:11.200
At the meetings of the Consultative Group, which is held regularly, technical issues of projects developed by the Committee on International Standards, as well as its strategy and work programs, are considered.

48:11.200 --> 48:25.200
In 1995, the Consultative Council was approved. It is a group of outstanding figures in the accounting profession and business.

48:25.200 --> 48:40.200
The Consultative Council conducts an expertise on the strategies and plans of the Government, contributes to the work of professional accountants, users of financial reporting,

48:40.200 --> 48:55.200
assures trust in the Committee's activities on international standards, compiles an annual report on the effectiveness of the Government's work, checks the Budget and Committee's financial reporting.

48:55.200 --> 49:12.200
To develop each specific standard, the Government approves the Preparatory Committee, headed by one of the Government's members, representatives of at least three countries and other organizations.

49:12.200 --> 49:27.200
The Preparatory Committee studies accounting practices at the national and regional levels, determines the circle of controversial issues on the topic, receives and analyzes the comments.

49:27.200 --> 49:43.200
After the discussion and approval, the Government develops and presents a preliminary project, which is published for the comments of all interested users.

49:43.200 --> 50:00.200
Based on the analysis and generalization of the comments, a standard project is being prepared, which is approved for publication with the support of three quarters of the Committee members.

50:00.200 --> 50:19.200
In 1997, the Interpretation Committee was formed. It was created to consider controversial issues of accounting,

50:19.200 --> 50:33.200
and to consider independent decisions that would lead to unacceptable accounting practices and to withdrawals from international standards.

50:33.200 --> 50:55.200
The Interpretation Committee constantly considers mature issues that do not meet satisfactory standards. The Committee is constantly reorganized on international standards.

50:55.200 --> 51:10.200
The Committee's proposals for a new structure were prepared by the Working Group on Strategy for several years. According to the Group's recommendations, the MSFO Act was amended.

51:10.200 --> 51:20.200
It was transformed into an independent organization managed by trusted persons.

51:40.200 --> 52:05.200
The Committee's governance is exclusively responsible for the development of accounting standards.

52:05.200 --> 52:21.200
The governance of the Committee on International Standards is formed on a professional basis, according to the relevant qualifications.

52:21.200 --> 52:47.200
At least five members of the Board should have experience of working as auditors. At least three members of the Finance Committee should be Finance Committee users. One member of the Board should have experience of teaching.

52:48.200 --> 53:02.200
The Consultative Council on Standards is formed on a regional basis, taking into account professional experience for consulting the Board members and trusted persons.

53:02.200 --> 53:16.200
The Committee has been in this reorganized form since 2001 and consists of four units.

53:16.200 --> 53:35.200
The Committee's task for international standards of financial accounting is to develop a single set of standards, to distribute them widely and to provide them with a uniform interpretation.

53:35.200 --> 53:54.200
The Convergence of National and International Standards is also being developed. The update of the document's position is a common practice of the Committee on MSFO.

53:54.200 --> 54:15.200
The Committee's new edition does not only dictate the harmonization or convergence of accounting policy of the professional community of accountants.

54:16.200 --> 54:35.200
The International Standards of Financial Accounting is a system of conceptual documents that establish the principles, components and ideas of financial accounting, but not the order of accounting.

54:35.200 --> 54:51.200
They do not contain the usual accounting plan for Russian financial workers, typical accounting procedures, the form of primary accounting documents, accounting registers.

54:51.200 --> 55:03.200
The International Standards of Financial Accounting consist of conceptual foundations for the preparation and presentation of financial accounting.

55:03.200 --> 55:32.200
The International Standards of Financial Accounting are the principles, conceptual foundations for the preparation and presentation of financial accounting.

55:33.200 --> 56:02.200
The principles are the foundation on which standards are created. The purpose of this document is to provide assistance to the Committee on International Standards of Financial Accounting.

56:03.200 --> 56:25.200
Secondly, it is to promote the harmonization and convergence of financial accounting. It is to provide assistance to the national bodies establishing standards, to the financial accounting components, to the auditors and users.

56:25.200 --> 56:45.200
The principles are to clarify the goals of financial accounting, its quality characteristics, elements, i.e., determination, recognition, assessment of financial accounting.

56:45.200 --> 57:02.200
The principles can be used by any commercial company in the private and public sector.

57:15.200 --> 57:43.200
The International Standards of Financial Accounting are the principles, conceptual foundations for the preparation and presentation of financial accounting.

57:45.200 --> 58:05.200
The International Standards of Financial Accounting are the principles, conceptual foundations for the preparation and presentation of financial accounting.

58:05.200 --> 58:25.200
Seven new standards have been developed and approved, including IFRS 1, IFRS 2, IFRS 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, with a new name.

58:25.200 --> 58:40.200
Significant adjustments have also been made to the interpretations issued to the individual standards. Many of them have been included as a component in the corrected or new standards.

58:40.200 --> 58:56.200
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Committee was working on new standards for the mining industry, insurance, discounting, and the pension plan assets.

58:56.200 --> 59:19.200
The Committee is supposed to make changes to the standards for the disclosure of information by banks and similar financial institutions, to the composition of financial accounting, to the unification of companies, to the accounting of small and medium-sized enterprises.

59:19.200 --> 59:33.200
The Committee is supposed to work on the possibility of using the Internet to present financial accounting information to investors and other users.

59:49.200 --> 01:00:15.200
The Committee is supposed to work on the possibility of using the Internet to present financial accounting information to investors and other users.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:43.200
What is continuity of activity? It means that an organization, once created, continues its work indefinitely. It is clear that no living organism can exist indefinitely, so it is called permissibility.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:01:06.200
It is necessary to make an accounting financial accounting based on this permissibility. It is necessary to assess the ability of a company to continue its activity in the near future.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:17.200
It is also necessary to reveal the facts of significant uncertainty that may affect the continuity of the organization's activities.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:53.200
The concept of the convergence of received income and spent expenses is a recognition of assets, obligations, income and expenses at the time of their occurrence, not payment.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:09.200
One of the quality characteristics of financial accounting is its clarity.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:30.200
It does not mean that clarity should be clear to the first-time user. It is assumed that a financial accounting user should have sufficient knowledge in the field of business and commercial activity, a desire to study information with due diligence.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:58.200
It does not mean that the complicated information that should be included in financial accounting, due to its compatibility with the decision-making process, should be excluded, only because it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:07.200
The next quality characteristic of financial accounting is its compatibility.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:19.200
Different periods within a company should be comparable. The financial accountability of various companies should be comparable.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:36.200
A consistent approach to the assessment and reflection of the financial result should be provided. Information on accounting policies and changes in accounting policies should be presented.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:53.200
The compatibility of information is the balance between its temporality and reliability.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:05.200
The later the period of information, the more reliable the information is, that is, it is free of many errors.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:39.200
Therefore, the balance between temporality and reliability should be observed, because no one needs old, outdated information.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:56.200
Users want to receive information on time. The costs of providing information should not exceed the benefits of the information provided.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:25.200
The information should be presented only in significant sections. Information is considered significant if its absence or incorrect assessment may affect the decision of the user based on the data of the financial account.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:39.200
The significance depends on the size, the threshold or the point of the account. The information should be reliable, that is, free of significant errors.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:52.200
A reliable presentation of the account means compliance with all the criteria of recognition. This is a priority of the content before the form.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:06:10.200
We represent the economic essence of the event, not its legal form. The information should be neutral, that is, not in anyone's interests.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:28.200
The principle of review should be observed. In the event of uncertainty, the income and assets should not be increased, the expenses and obligations should not be reduced.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:51.200
The information should be presented in all its entirety, that is, in all significant sections, without any omissions. The connection between significance and costs of benefits should be ensured.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:07:04.200
A reliable presentation of the financial account is the correct application of international standards. This is a choice of relevant accounting policies.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:14.200
An inappropriate approach cannot be compensated for by the disclosure of the financial account or its application.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:35.200
The information should be presented in accordance with the quality characteristics of the financial account. Additional disclosure of information should be provided if the information is not enough to understand.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:51.200
The principles of the financial account also give the concept of the main elements of financial accountability. What are assets, obligations, and the concept of capital?

01:07:51.200 --> 01:08:06.200
Assets are the resources of a controlled company that arose as a result of past periods and from which economic benefits are expected in the future.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:18.200
What can it be? It is the main resources, non-material assets, reserves, ready-made products, goods, money.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:32.200
Control is the unlimited access and at the same time the ability to prohibit access to other people's rights to future economic benefits.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:54.200
Property is not a necessary obligation. It is a current debt formed as a result of past periods and from which the outflow of resources containing economic benefits is expected in the future.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:09.200
What are the obligations? We have taken a loan. We have employees. We have to pay them a salary at the end of the month. At the end of the month, it is an obligation.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Employees earn their right to vacation during the working period. Therefore, we have to create a reserve for the payment of vacation payments. We have received a commodity, but we have not paid for it.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:10:01.200
Capital is given as a balancing factor in international standards. It is the difference between assets and obligations. It is the remaining share in the company's assets after all obligations are paid.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:21.200
Sometimes it is called pure assets. It is not only the established capital. It can be both established capital, that is, the capital with the owner, and the capital that the company has already earned.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:44.200
It is part of the unallocated profit that comes here, what is left of the company. It is reserve capital. It is additional capital that comes here. International financial reporting standards use different assessment bases.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:11:09.200
These are the initial costs, the current costs, the realized costs, the allocated costs, the potential obligations, and the fair costs.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:24.200
As we have already said, the financial reporting system is a living organism, the general direction of which is from historical value to fair value.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:46.200
Fair value is the value at which assets can be exchanged, and obligations can be paid off as a result of a deal between the informed, independent, and those who wish to make this deal.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:12:13.200
This assessment is widely presented in the standards themselves. In the financial reporting system, income and expenses are included. Income is the return on the profit in the reporting period in the form of asset inflow or obligation reduction, which leads to capital increase, not related to the share of shareholders.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:26.200
When income appears, we provide a service, we sell a product, a finished product, we get income, we have to pay it.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:45.200
Expenses are the reduction of economic benefits in the form of asset inflow or obligation reduction, which leads to capital decrease, not related to the share of shareholders.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:13:09.200
In the production process, we use raw materials, we use labor, we have to pay it, we use machines, equipment, that is, basic means.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:17.200
All this leads to a reduction of economic benefits. These are the expenses of the enterprise.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:33.200
Since the financial reporting is about assets and obligations, not about property, there is a process of recognition.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:49.200
The process of recognition is the process of including in the report an object or article that corresponds to the definition of this element and meets the recognition criteria.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:14:00.200
The process is the description in words, reflection in the monetary amount, including in the accounting report or accounting report.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:11.200
The recognition criteria are the probability of receiving or losing economic benefits. The cost can be reliably measured.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:26.200
In 2003, the IFRS-1 standard was adopted, the first application of the IMF, which clarifies and specifies the basic principles of the first application.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:41.200
The purpose of this standard is to ensure that the first set of financial reports prepared in accordance with the IMF contained high-quality information

01:14:41.200 --> 01:15:01.200
First, transparent in the eyes of users. Second, comparable for all periods in which it was presented. Third, it would be the starting point for the transition to the IMF.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:10.200
Fourth, the expenses for preparation of which would not exceed the value of the IMF for users.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:45.200
The IMF would be prepared to make a clear and unconditional statement on its compliance with all international standards of financial reporting.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:16:03.200
According to this standard, companies must determine which reporting will be the first, prepare an introductory balance on the IMF on the date of transition to these standards,

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:22.200
choose an accounting policy that meets the international standards of financial reporting, and apply it in retrospect to all periods provided in the first financial report on the IMF.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:37.200
Make a decision on the use of any of the six possible voluntary exceptions that exempt it from retrospective application.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:55.200
Apply three mandatory exceptions when the retrospective application of standards is not allowed. Disclose the financial reporting in detail, the information explaining the peculiarities of the transition to the IMF.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:21.200
Pay attention to this slide. The definition of the reporting date is also given here, and the date of transition. The reporting date is December 31, 2007. The date of transition, the date of the introductory balance, will be January 1, 2006.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:37.200
The main thing is that the organization must apply all the standards that have come into force on the date of the first financial report on the IMF, their retrospective application.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:18:02.200
The preparation of the introductory balance on the IMF provides for recognizing all the assets and obligations that the IMF requires, not recognizing assets and obligations that are not allowed by the standards, reclassify the reporting articles from the regional rules in the IMF,

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:22.200
apply the IMF when evaluating all recognized assets and obligations. What does it mean to recognize all assets and obligations, recognition of which is required by international standards of financial reporting?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:45.200
For many companies, this means that they will have to recognize additional assets and obligations. For example, pension plans with established payments, tax and assets and financial leases,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:19:04.200
reserves on obligations, production and financial instruments, acquired non-material assets. What does it mean not to recognize assets and obligations, recognition of which is not allowed by international standards?

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:24.200
Companies will have to stop recognizing certain assets and obligations that they recognized in accordance with the national rules used in advance. For example, reserves in the absence of legal or out-of-practice obligations.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:46.200
For example, reserves for the repair of basic means. This is not an obligation and it is not recognized. Internal non-material assets are also not recognized in accordance with the IMF.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:20:08.200
Delayed tax requirements when repayment is not likely, future period expenses, individual assets and obligations must be reclassified. Investments must be made in accordance with the IMF-39.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:28.200
Some financial instruments that were previously classified as capital, for example, regulated shares that are subject to compulsory purchase, the IMF considers as a duty.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:44.200
All assets and obligations in relation to which a balance was made, not taking into account the requirements for the balance provided by international standards, for example, the balance of insurance repayment.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:21:12.200
Debitors must be corrected. Obligations on the reward of workers in accordance with the IMF-19, the reward of workers. Delayed taxes in accordance with the IMF-12. Financial instruments in accordance with the IMF-39. Financial instruments, recognition and assessment.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:30.200
Reserves in accordance with the IMF-37. Assessments, conditional obligations, conditional assets. Devaluation of basic means, non-material assets in accordance with the IMF-36. Devaluation of assets.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:59.200
All adjustments to the accounting policy before the IMF is used are recognized as either unallocated profits or capital on the date of the transition to international financial standards.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:18.200
One of the stages of the transition to the IMF is the development of accounting policy, which is made in accordance with the requirements of international standards.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:32.200
Accounting policy is a concrete principle, basis, condition, rule and practice adopted by the company for the preparation and presentation of financial reporting.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:47.200
Accounting policy must be selected and applied in such a way that the financial reporting meets all the requirements of each of the applied standards.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:23:08.200
Organizations try to bring the accounting policy of the PERS-CSU and the IMF to the IMF as close as possible.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:24.200
This reduces the number of adjustments to the IMF, reduces labor capacity and training time, and improves the quality of reporting.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:35.200
Organizations can make reporting in accordance with international standards by the following two main methods.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:56.200
This is either the transformation of the data of the Russian accounting in accordance with the IMF, as banks and most Russian organizations do, or the parallel implementation of accounting policy according to Russian international standards.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:10.200
The parallel accounting is carried out by Lukoil, Rusal, Knauf and other companies.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:23.200
Transformation is the translation of the Russian financial reporting into international one by adjusting certain indicators.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:34.200
The methods of obtaining this information differ according to Russian standards from those of international standards.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:52.200
The method is based on the approach in which the information is formed according to Russian standards, analyzed and corrected to bring it to the international standards.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:25:18.200
This method is widely used in Europe and other countries, as national standards apply to individual reporting in the vast majority of countries, and the IMF standards apply to consolidated reporting.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:35.200
The question is, what is more profitable for an enterprise to carry out parallel accounting or transformation, and who will be engaged in the composition of reporting in the IMF format.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:47.200
The enterprise decides whether the team, the auditing consulting firm or its own employees are invited.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:26:14.200
At present, many large firms can already transform accounting with their own efforts. They have accumulated solid experience, prepared highly qualified personnel, and finally, there are special sections that are engaged in the transformation of accounting data.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:26.200
Such companies carry out accounting transformation at a fairly high level.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:46.200
These are banks, for example, TransAero, Irkutsk Energo, Sveza Group, and so on.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:27:12.200
The main external argument in favor of the transition to the composition of accounting based on international standards is that such a transition becomes an important step to ensure the openness and transparency of Russian companies.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:38.200
Their competitiveness is also increasing, including in the fight for the capital market. The cost of their borrowed funds is decreasing, as well as the overall improvement of the financial market in Russia.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:58.200
The use of internationally recognized principles of accounting disciplines companies that make up and represent accounting, as the transition to international standards implies the formation of accounting forms that apply all standards in general.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:24.200
Accounting that meets international standards allows for a more objective assessment not only of the financial state of the company, but also of the efficiency of the company's management system as a whole and of its business segments. This is necessary not only for external users, but also for the company's management.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:42.200
As we have already said, the main criteria for accounting systems are principles, not rules, because it is impossible to establish rules for all cases that arise in business practice.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:53.200
The MCFO plays a special role in the principle. For a Western accountant, it is a kind of a canon.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:26.200
The standard T allows for the decision-making of a professional judgment of an accountant. The standard T determines the list of financial reporting articles, the level of significance, and the compatibility of information for the user.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:43.200
The standard T provides that when solving a significant number of issues that arise in the process of accounting preparation, one should focus on the professional judgment of the accountant.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:30:10.200
A certain break in the accounting preparation process is required by the company's management and external accounting users, who are used to the fact that each stage of accounting, starting with the primary document and ending with the preparation of accounting forms, is regulated by the standards.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:38.200
Transformation consists in clarifying the differences in accounting and reporting by the MCFO and the MCFO, and in removing the corresponding differences by the usual method of traditional accounting, the method of double-recording for the purpose of obtaining data suitable for compiling reports in accordance with international standards.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:31:00.200
Therefore, to qualitatively identify the differences from the MCFO, knowledge of both national accounting standards and the practice of applying national standards within a specific company is required.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:25.200
The knowledge of international standards in relation to the reflections of operations typical for a given company is required. The performer of the transformation must also have analytical skills and a mathematical view of eliminating differences in these two types of accounting.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:38.200
The excellent transformers of financial accounting are auditors who know the MCFO and MCFO and have education in higher mathematics.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:32:00.200
To carry out the transformation in Excel or other software products, the skills of working with the appropriate software at the level of an advanced user, and sometimes a programmer, are required.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:16.200
The method of transformation is less expensive than parallel accounting and can be carried out in a month and a half after obtaining the annual Russian report.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:39.200
Upon completion of the transformation process, the enterprise receives detailed structured information on the specifics of the activity, both in Russian and in international standards, and has a great awareness of its financial accounting based on this data.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:56.200
The transformation of accounting in the format of international standards requires the interest of the company management, which should be involved in the transformation process of all company managers.

01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:20.200
The information required by some managers is important for the implementation of the transformation, and the help of others in the justification of some calculations is important for all managers to understand the benefits for the enterprise from obtaining financial accounting according to the standards of the MCFO.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:31.200
Parallel accounting is usually considered as the next step after obtaining the report on the method of transformation.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:53.200
Here, all the main differences between Russian and international standards should be included in a separate account and reflected in the MCFO and RSCB database in parallel.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:16.200
Parallel accounting is determined by the need to enter information into a computer system, which will later automatically carry out this operation in both the RSCB database and the international financial accounting database.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:34.200
The cost of such systems usually ranges from $25,000 to $1 million.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:48.200
It is also necessary to plan the costs for the configuration of such systems for a particular enterprise, which can account for about half of the cost of the system itself.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:35:07.200
Among the most common systems in Russia, we can highlight SAP R3, Microsoft Naivision, Microsoft Accepta, Oracle, Scala, 1S version 8, and others.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:20.200
The transition to accounting based on international financial accounting standards is a very expensive process, not only for individual enterprises.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:33.200
The cost of paying for the services of third-party consultants, retraining of personnel, hiring new personnel, obtaining and filing of appropriate software,

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:51.200
the reconstruction of internal documents of circulation and control, mandatory audit of accounting based on international standards, and supervision of state bodies,

01:35:51.200 --> 01:36:03.200
is a very expensive process.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:18.200
What are the types of accounting?

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:55.200
International standards of financial accounting, the quality characteristics of international standards of financial accounting, who develops these standards, how are they applied?

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:08.200
We have considered the ways of transitioning companies to providing accounting based on international standards.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:20.200
I hope that the knowledge you have gained will be useful for your future work. I wish you success.
