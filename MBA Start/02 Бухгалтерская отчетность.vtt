00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What are the documents for the operation?

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
All economic operations are documented in accordance with the current legislation.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
This documentation is taken to the accountants of the enterprises and is reflected in the accounting record.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
The variety of existing documents can be grouped according to certain characteristics.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.000
The purpose of the documents can be administrative, combined, accounting and justification.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
The example of administrative documents is the order of the manager or the contract of the organization, for example, the delivery contract.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
Combined documents are payment and accounting information when accounting with the staff.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Accounting documents are the accounting certificate.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Justification documents are the deposit for the purchase of a product.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
The time of the documents' completion can be primary or combined.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
The primary documents are the payment and accounting documents.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
The combined documents are the register of all payment and accounting documents for one day.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
The documents on the volume of information are divided into disposable and accumulative.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
The documents on the place of composition are external and internal.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
For example, the external document is the deposit from the supplier, the internal document is the incoming order of the organization.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
The documents can look like a table, questionnaire and combined.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
It is better to design and design primary documents with the managers in close contact with the accounting department.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
This will prevent unnecessary errors when designing documents.

02:15.000 --> 02:27.000
Any organization should select those who have a direct relationship with the design of primary documents and train them to design them correctly.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
It is important to remember that the period of storing primary documents is regulated in Russia for at least 5 years.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
The responsibility for storing and filling them is not the accountant, but the manager.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
All economic operations should be designed with justification documents.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
These documents are the primary accounting documents, on the basis of which accounting is carried out.

02:58.000 --> 03:08.000
The internal documents are the requirements, the incoming order, the external documents, the accounts, the deposits.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
The documents can be multilateral, such as a trilateral contract or a multilateral act.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
A specific document should be created for each economic operation.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
For example, I would like to draw your attention to the combined table in different situations.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Let's say that the primary funds are reflected as a contribution to the statutory capital.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
What documents are required for this?

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The primary funds received from the institutions are the ones that are used to produce the documents.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
The primary funds are received on the basis of the Act on the Receipt and Transmission of Primary Funds.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
The procedure for acquiring the primary funds also consists of several stages.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
First, a purchase-sale contract is drawn up, and a bill for payment is issued.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
This is also a type of document.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
The main funds are paid by the legal entities.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
This means that the account will be issued and the organization will be charged.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
To obtain the primary funds, the goods-transport deposit is issued and the invoice is accompanied by it.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
The main funds of the accounting are taken into account.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
The document is drawn up as the Act on the Receipt and Transmission of Primary Funds.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
The primary funds are transferred to the current long-term lease.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
The lease contract is drawn up and the payment is issued.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
To record the fact of the transfer of the primary funds to the leaseholder,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
the Act on the Receipt and Transmission of Primary Funds is drawn up.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
The payment is recorded by the organization's account.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
This is an example of the documentation of some operations.

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
The justification documents of the organization confirm the fact of the economic operation.

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
The justification documents can be used for the income and expenditure deposits, various documents, cash checks, and other documents.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
The accounting staff usually deal with accounting documents.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
These documents do not contain facts that confirm the performance of economic operations.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
These are the accounts of the accountant, the accounting documents,

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
and they serve as the basis for further accounting records.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
The accounting registers are the documents of analytical and synthetic accounting,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
the notations, the order books, and the accounting books,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
but they are not the subject of our consideration in this course.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
The combined documents contain the signs of both the administrative and the justification documents.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
For example, the deposit requirement for the release of materials from warehouses,

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
the production of goods, the transport deposit, the accounting payment,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
the notice of payment, the salary, and so on.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
I will try to explain to you what the combined documents are.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's take the accounting payment notice for the payment of the salary.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
The first function of the document is the accounting registration document.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
The accountant compiles this notice for the persons receiving the salary,

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
then he lists the salary and determines the amount to be paid.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Then the function of this document is the administrative one.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
After the accounting payment notice is transferred to the cash register,

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
it serves as the basis for issuing the salary to each worker.

07:19.000 --> 07:29.000
After the salary is issued, all workers are signed that they have received the money.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
This is the justification document for the cash register that he has issued the money from the cash register.

07:36.000 --> 07:47.000
The primary documents are the documents for the payment and release of materials,

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
the payment of the salary, the unloading of products, the cash register, the payment instructions, and so on.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
The combined documents are the first stage of the data collection,

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
which is contained in several primary documents that precede their accounting processing.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
For example, these are the goods reports of the materially responsible persons,

08:09.000 --> 08:18.000
cash register reports, or reports of the persons responsible for the expenditure of the money advance.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
This is how the primary documents are summarized,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
and the payment instructions are also calculated according to the salary.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
The documents on which the economic operations have been carried out are sent to your accountant,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
where three types of verification are carried out.

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
The first type is a formal verification, when the accountant checks the correctness of the form.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Are all the sections of the document filled in?

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Are all the requisites filled in correctly?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Are the requisites fully filled in?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
The second type is a verification of the existence of the document.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
This is a verification of the existence of the document.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
And finally, the third type is an arithmetic verification,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
which checks the correctness of the calculation of the data in the document.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
The accountant must calculate whether all the data is filled in correctly.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
What should be done to avoid mistakes?

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
The head of the organization must build a scheme of the circulation of the document.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
He must identify the persons who make up the document,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
who check it, and who, based on the document,

09:45.000 --> 09:53.000
either issue the goods, or receive the goods, or sum up the work done.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
He must conduct an analysis of the typical errors,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
and teach everyone who has a relationship with the registration of the document

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
the basic rules of registration.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
He must organize the service of internal control.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
The modern and high-quality registration of primary accounting documents,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
their transfer to the established terms for reflection in the accounting record,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
as well as the reliability of the data contained in them,

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
provide the persons who have compiled and signed these documents.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
An example of a circulation scheme is shown in the textbook.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Here is a video lecture in the form of a table.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
For example, to issue a travel list to a driver,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
this document must be compiled by either the dispatcher,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
or the mechanic, or the driver himself.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
The period for which this document is compiled is the period of the trip.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
The organization's employees must compile this document every day.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Who will process the document?

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
The person in charge is appointed, the accountant,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
and these documents are processed every day.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
When the document is transferred to the archive,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
the person in charge is also assigned,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
who must hand this document over to the archive,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and the transfer period to the archive,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
let's say, the period of the report.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
The accountant collects the travel lists within a month,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
and at the end, he submits them to the archive.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
Similarly, other documents are presented in the table.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
This is an example of a circulation scheme in the form of a table.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
I want to remind you of a situation from a literary work.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Let's recall Bulgakov.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
There was a dialogue.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Where did this Makhta come from?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Who knows?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So, they made a contract with him?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, we have to assume,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Vasily Stepanovich was worried.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
If he was a prisoner, he had to go through the accounting department.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Vasily Stepanovich was worried.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Where is he?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
He said, the accountant is not here.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
He was getting more and more pale, shaking his hands.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Indeed, there are no traces of the contract in the accounting department,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
the director, Lekhadeev, or Varynokh.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
The accounting rules are that there are no documents, no circulation.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
The fact that there is a reflection of the economic operation in the accounting and tax records is present.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
However, the primary documents and economic contracts are either absent at all,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
or presented in dubious copies, or incomplete.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
This is exactly the typical mistake that leads to negative financial and tax consequences.

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
There is a situation when the head of the organization does not agree with the opinion of the chief accountant.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
How to deal with this situation?

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
In the event of a disagreement between the head of the organization and the chief accountant

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
on the implementation of separate economic operations,

13:19.000 --> 13:28.000
the primary accounting documents can be used to carry out the written order of the head of the organization.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Since the head of the organization bears full responsibility for the consequences of such operations

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
and for including them in the accounting records.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
If the head of the organization has given the order, the accountant is obliged to include these documents in the accounting records.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
If the controlling authorities make a request for the removal of the primary documents,

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
I would like to remind you that the accounting documents can be withdrawn only by the authorities of the preliminary investigation

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
and the prosecutor's office, courts, and the Tax Administration on the basis of their decisions in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
Do not forget that the decision on the withdrawal should contain a clear list of the documents and the reason for their withdrawal.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
The withdrawal of documents simply for verification by the current legislation is not provided.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
The chief accountant or another official of the organization has the right to remove copies of the documents

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
with the indication of the basis and date of withdrawal from the permission of the representatives of the bodies carrying out the withdrawal.

14:38.000 --> 14:50.000
The forms of the primary documents that are taken into account by the accountants are developed and approved by the statistical bodies.

14:50.000 --> 15:03.000
At the moment, there are quite a lot of such forms, even in terms of their uniformity classification.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
For example, there are forms for accounting personnel, working hours and payroll,

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
capital construction, products, commodity values,

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
cash payments to the population with the use of cash machines,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
trading and cash transactions, inventory results,

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
accounting for the main funds, non-material assets, accounting for materials, accounting for work in automotive, and so on.

15:33.000 --> 15:44.000
Many of them are obtained by the accountant after these documents pass through the hands of the manager or an ordinary employee of the organization.

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
What requisites must be in these documents?

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
The naming of the document is a financial and economic content of the economic operation.

16:01.000 --> 16:10.000
A document without a naming and a document with an unclear, poorly read naming has no legal power.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
The accountant must understand what document he is working with to decide on the economic operation that he should register in the accounting record.

16:20.000 --> 16:35.000
Often, the name of the document must include payment, tax, registration and mail requisites of legal and physical parties involved in the economic operation.

16:35.000 --> 16:45.000
A document without the naming of the requisites of at least one of the parties of the operation loses its addressability and cannot be accepted for execution.

16:45.000 --> 16:57.000
A document with an unclear writing or a document with no date loses its time period in which it should be registered.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
In fact, such a document also has no legal power.

17:02.000 --> 17:13.000
A document with a naming of the document in which it is reflected in its general form is also a necessary requisite for the maintenance of the economic operation.

17:13.000 --> 17:26.000
The necessity of a strict compliance with the naming of the document in the maintenance of the economic operation is determined by the principle of objectivity of registration in the accounting record.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
The document must contain measurements of the economic operation.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
The absence of a measurement in the document can be natural in terms of units of weight, size, labor, man-hour and money.

17:39.000 --> 17:49.000
According to the Russian Federation law, the absence of a measurement in the document in rubles deprives it of its accounting basis.

17:49.000 --> 18:05.000
If you have to work with commodity values that have a measurement in money, but in the money of other countries,

18:05.000 --> 18:17.000
it is allowed to add another count to this document, in which the conditional units or money units of other countries will be recalculated to the unit of Russia's accounting in rubles.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
The document must contain signatures of the responsible persons with the decryption of their positions and surnames.

18:24.000 --> 18:36.000
The first signature should belong to the head of the organization, the director of loans, for example, the general director, and the second signature should belong to the chief accountant.

18:36.000 --> 18:47.000
The required requisites for the primary document are the names of the documents, the names of the requisites of the parties, the date of the composition,

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
the content of the economic operation, the measurements of the economic operation, and the signatures of the responsible persons.

18:55.000 --> 19:10.000
Disobedience to any of the requirements for the documentation can cause the workers of the controlling bodies to doubt the authenticity of the document presented to them,

19:10.000 --> 19:23.000
as a result of which the cost of the produced product and the dispute over the correctness of the profit calculation may be excluded.

19:23.000 --> 19:32.000
Thus, for example, in the absence of documents confirming the fact of the use of certain resources in the production process,

19:32.000 --> 19:41.000
when a document is checked, the workers of the tax authorities may deem it unlawful to deduct the costs for the cost of the product.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
There may be other negative consequences of incorrect documentation.

19:46.000 --> 20:00.000
For example, let's look at the situation. The salary of the workers for the production of parts was produced on the basis of the orders, which were not signed by the master or the head of the workshop.

20:00.000 --> 20:14.000
The absence of the signature of the responsible person on the orders for the production of works can mean both that such works were not produced at all, and that the works were actually produced, but they were not necessary.

20:14.000 --> 20:31.000
In the first case, we have the fact of the fraud of documents and the fact of money laundering, if the worker has already received a salary without a basis, as well as a reduction in the cost of living.

20:31.000 --> 20:39.000
In the second case, we have the fact of the irrational use of the enterprise funds and the reduction in the cost of living.

20:39.000 --> 20:48.000
In this case, the organization will have to look for other ways to prove the actual implementation of the costs and their production direction.

20:48.000 --> 20:57.000
One of the evidences may be documents confirming the delivery of the finished parts to the warehouse.

20:57.000 --> 21:09.000
However, in order to prove that the parts made according to the incorrectly designed orders were delivered to the warehouse, it will be necessary to analyze all the documents in the organization,

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
the movement of materials and finished products, and to make inventory in the warehouse.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
As you can see, obtaining evidence is possible, but it is quite laborious.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
And when there are a lot of incorrectly designed documents in the account, it is difficult to implement them.

21:30.000 --> 21:38.000
The next situation is the one in the overhead. There is no date for obtaining the materials from the warehouse.

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
The absence of a date for obtaining the materials from the warehouse does not allow us to determine the reporting period for the obtained materials.

21:47.000 --> 21:57.000
To determine this, we will have to make inventory of the materials and products made with their use,

21:57.000 --> 22:05.000
to conduct a comparative analysis of the movement of materials, the period of use in production and the delivery to the warehouse of the finished product,

22:05.000 --> 22:14.000
and to compare the obtained data with the data on the implementation of the finished product.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
The terms of the initial registration of the documents must be completed at the time of the economic operation.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
If this is not possible for objective reasons, then it must be done immediately after the operation.

22:28.000 --> 22:37.000
This is due to the fact that the main purpose of the initial registration of documents is to record the fact of the economic operation.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
In order to ensure that the document turnover is not overloaded, according to Russian legislation,

22:42.000 --> 22:50.000
the organization can modify the recommended typical forms of documents, taking into account the specifics of its activities.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
For example, add additional requisites.

22:55.000 --> 23:09.000
The organization issues cash reports on the economic and operational expenses of the employees in terms of size and term determined by the head.

23:09.000 --> 23:20.000
Those who receive cash reports are obliged to submit a document called an advance report to the accounting office

23:20.000 --> 23:27.000
within three working days after the deadline for which they are issued or upon return from a business trip.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
The report is about the spent amounts and the final calculation of them must be made.

23:33.000 --> 23:42.000
In practice, this happens often when an employee acquires material values for the employer's needs,

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
not only without receiving the money report, but even without permission to act in the interests of the organization.

23:49.000 --> 23:59.000
Such permission to act in the interests of the organization gives the organization its trust.

23:59.000 --> 24:10.000
If the head does not have permission to issue an advance report, it turns out that the employee bought some property and then sold it to his home office.

24:10.000 --> 24:18.000
Therefore, when the employee is paid for his position, the payment of the property is not the expense of the transfer,

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
but the payment of the property according to the purchase-sale contract and the physical receipt of the income.

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
There is a limit to the amount of cash payments between legal entities and individuals.

24:37.000 --> 24:47.000
Today, this is 100,000 rubles per contract. This is the Bank of Russia's statement.

24:48.000 --> 25:01.000
There is an arbitration practice that indicates that only parties who bring cash from a superimposed limit should be held accountable for exceeding the limit.

25:01.000 --> 25:12.000
What to do if the initial document is issued, for example, the same deposit, and inaccuracies are made?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
What if a cash document is issued?

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
The issuance of the correction is not allowed in cash and bank documents,

25:20.000 --> 25:31.000
and the correction can be made in other initial accounting documents based on the agreement with the parties who made and signed these documents.

25:31.000 --> 25:39.000
This must be confirmed by the signatures of the same parties with the date of the issuance of the correction.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
This can also be read in the textbook.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Let's look at one example of the correction.

25:48.000 --> 25:58.000
The master of the sewing workshop, a financially responsible person, issued a demand for a deposit for the receipt of 120 satin-green shoulder straps from the warehouse.

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
The head of the sewing workshop, signing the demand for a deposit, ordered to receive 150 meters of fabric.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
To correct the error, the master of the sewing workshop must mark the inscription 120, put 150 and write next to it,

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
corrected to 150, the date of the correction is provided under the correction record.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
The correction record is verified by the signature of the master with the indication of his position, surname, and the head of the workshop.

26:27.000 --> 26:37.000
Subsequently, other people who will sign this document, the head of the supply department, the warehouse keeper, should also put their signature under the correction record.

26:37.000 --> 26:47.000
Thus, if the correction is made at the initial stage of the composition of the document, it is better not to correct it, but to compose it again.

26:48.000 --> 26:56.000
The same initial documents are used in accounting for taxation purposes.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Examples can also be found in the e-book.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
The registration of economic transactions with money.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I want to dwell on this procedure a little.

27:11.000 --> 27:26.000
The list of persons who have the right to sign the primary accounting documents is approved by the head of the organization in accordance with the main accountant.

27:26.000 --> 27:39.000
The documents that are used to register an economic transaction with money are signed by the head of the organization, the main accountant, or the persons authorized to do so.

27:39.000 --> 27:53.000
Without the signature of the main accountant or the person authorized to do so, the financial and credit obligations of the money accounting documents are considered invalid and should not be executed.

27:53.000 --> 28:05.000
If a situation arises when a document is required to be signed by a person, but it is not specified in the list of persons who have the right to sign the corresponding documents,

28:05.000 --> 28:15.000
then the worker must be authorized by a special order of the head of the organization to carry out these actions.

28:15.000 --> 28:27.000
The order must include the visa of the main accountant, if the permission is granted to sign the money or accounting documents, as well as the financial or credit obligations.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
Or the worker must be given the appropriate confidentiality.

28:32.000 --> 28:41.000
If a document is signed by a person who does not belong to the organization, then the validity of such a document is controversial.

28:41.000 --> 28:52.000
Any party to the deal, as well as third parties to this basis, can insist that the validity of the document and the deal should be recognized.

28:53.000 --> 29:06.000
If the organization approves the actions of the workers, then the economic operation according to the Russian legislation is considered to be carried out on behalf of the organization.

29:06.000 --> 29:17.000
What will happen if the accounting documents are lost? Let's try to assess the extent of the disaster.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
There are different types of responsibility. Administrative and criminal.

29:24.000 --> 29:32.000
In what cases is the responsibility of the organization and its officials for the loss of accounting documents?

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
The administrative penalty for the officials is the violation of the terms and order of storing documents.

29:38.000 --> 29:47.000
The official is the general director, accountant or person responsible for the preservation of documents.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
The administrative penalty can be as high as 2,000 to 3,000 rubles.

29:55.000 --> 30:11.000
The officials are also liable for the loss of accounting documents and tax authorities if these actions have caused a large or particularly large tax evasion.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
Let's look at the distribution of documents.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
As I said, they include various types of orders, trusts, contracts and agreements.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
Let's pay more attention to the contracts and agreements.

30:28.000 --> 30:38.000
Based on such a distribution document as a contract or agreement, a number of primary accounting documents can be formed.

30:38.000 --> 30:53.000
For example, a document on the disposal of goods and material valuables, a payment document for payment of received valuables, an act of service, and so on.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
Choosing a type of contract and errors in the formulation of a contract can lead to serious tax consequences.

31:01.000 --> 31:11.000
In order to ensure the correctness of accounting and tax accounting, it is recommended to prescribe a contract policy in addition to accounting policy.

31:11.000 --> 31:22.000
I would like to give an example of such a contract policy, the basis of its composition, using the example of a purchase-sale deal.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
Let's consider four situations that may arise during a deal.

31:29.000 --> 31:40.000
The contract provides for a preliminary payment of goods and the right to property is transferred at the time of their discharge.

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
Is it beneficial to the buyer? Is it beneficial to the supplier? Let's look at this in more detail.

31:48.000 --> 31:56.000
At this point, the buyer is distracted from the turnover, and the supplier has a free loan.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
Are the conditions beneficial to the seller and not to the buyer?

32:01.000 --> 32:10.000
In the case where the preliminary payment of goods is provided by the contract, and the right to property is transferred only at the time of their payment,

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
the buyer becomes the owner of the goods.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
The goods can be resold to the buyer directly from the supplier's warehouse.

32:19.000 --> 32:26.000
According to the goods, the buyer can show the budget.

32:26.000 --> 32:41.000
The conditions are beneficial to the buyer and the seller, because the buyer receives money for the goods immediately at the time of their discharge.

32:41.000 --> 32:51.000
The next situation is when the preliminary payment of goods is provided by the contract, and the right to property is transferred at the time of their discharge.

32:51.000 --> 32:58.000
The seller loses the right to property for the goods, and thus credits the buyer.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
The buyer uses a free goods loan before their payment.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
Are the conditions beneficial to the buyer and not to the seller?

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
In the case of the subsequent payment of goods with the right to property being transferred at the time of their payment,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
the buyer receives money for the goods, and thus credits the buyer.

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
This is a very interesting situation, when the seller seems to protect himself from the delay in the buyer's payment.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
But in practice, the buyer, having received the goods, begins to resell them before the payment.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
It is difficult to track this situation, especially if the batches of goods are large.

33:37.000 --> 33:48.000
This option of signing a contract is only effective for the seller in relation to certain goods, either individual or individual deliveries.

33:48.000 --> 33:56.000
Next, let's talk about the price of the deal that can be signed by the contract.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
The parties of the contract can, with the exception of cases specifically indicated by the regulatory documents,

34:03.000 --> 34:13.000
independently set the price of the contract and the conditions for its possible changes.

34:14.000 --> 34:28.000
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in addition to the price of the deal, the contract also stipulates a tax on the added value.

34:28.000 --> 34:46.000
If you forgot to write this down in the contract, then your counterpart may require an additional tax on this contract in the amount of the tax on the added value.

34:46.000 --> 35:00.000
In any case, you must write down in the contract either the contract price includes the tax on the added value, or this tax is taken over the price of the deal and the amount is negotiated.

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
In cases where the price of the deal is not specified and cannot be determined based on the terms of the contract,

35:07.000 --> 35:19.000
the fulfillment of the contract must be paid at a price that, under comparable circumstances, is usually taken for similar works or services.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
According to the general rules, this is the Vienna Convention.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
It is also necessary to choose a counterpart according to the contract.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
Before concluding the contract, you need to inquire about the legal status of your counterpart.

35:37.000 --> 35:49.000
Is he an organization with a common tax system, or does he have a simplified tax system?

35:49.000 --> 35:57.000
If the enterprise acquires a product, work, or service, and is the taxpayer of the tax on the added value,

35:57.000 --> 36:06.000
it is important for him that the value of the product purchased includes this tax, which could be taken to account.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
That is, the counterpart according to the contract, the supplier, should also be a taxpayer of the NTS.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
I want to show you this with a simple numerical example.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Let's consider two options.

36:19.000 --> 36:29.000
In the first option, the consumables will be acquired from organizations that are not taxpayers of the tax on the added value.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
In the second option, the consumables will be acquired from organizations that are taxpayers of the NTS.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
You can see the calculations in front of you.

36:41.000 --> 36:54.000
The NTS budget for the products you have produced in the first option will be 9,000 rubles.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
In the second option, it will be less than 3,600 rubles.

37:01.000 --> 37:11.000
This already determines the outflow of money in the first option, it is much more than in the second.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
And let's also calculate the tax-adhered profit.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
According to the first option, this profit will be about 11,000 rubles.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
According to the second option, more than 20,000 rubles.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
It is up to you to decide which deal will be more profitable for you.

37:30.000 --> 37:41.000
The correctness of the registration of the initials and distribution documents can significantly affect the financial result of the enterprise.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
The forms of the initial documents can be adapted to the specifications of the enterprise.

37:47.000 --> 37:58.000
To avoid risks, it is necessary to train and regulate the activities of employees who have a relationship with the registration of the initials.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
Accountants and lawyers of the organization are your internal consultants in the issue of minimizing risks

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
that are associated with the incorrect registration of the initials and distribution documents.

38:17.000 --> 38:36.000
In conclusion, I firmly believe that understanding the financial accountability of an accountant will improve the prospects of your career.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
You will never play football without knowing the rules of the game.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
Knowing the basics of financial games gives you the opportunity to look at your work with a fresh eye,

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
assess your personal efficiency better than before, and increase the profitability of your business.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
Now you can ask more professional questions to your chief accountant, for example.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
How does he choose specific time frames for amortization?

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
Perhaps, when he has completed the first step, he will ask for your advice.
