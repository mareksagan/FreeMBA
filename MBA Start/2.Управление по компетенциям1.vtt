00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
What does it mean?

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
It means that the staff knows that the competence model exists, it exists.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
But when it comes to the manager and says,

00:19.000 --> 00:32.000
determine what competencies are necessary for the future employee, the application to which you have submitted.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
The manager answers, listen, determine something yourself.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Well, you know, you know our specifics so well.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You are not the first time you are looking for an employee for me.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Come up with something yourself.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
The manager nods his head, perhaps he comes up with something himself,

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
a certain model of competence that he has, or maybe not, and does everything as usual.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Thus, it is important to understand that the development of a competence model is only the beginning.

00:55.000 --> 01:06.000
The beginning before the future process of implementation, application and testing in our corporate practice.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
It is important to understand the following, that having this tool,

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
the staff manager can no longer say that he does not participate and is not responsible for the management decisions

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
regarding the employees who are hired.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I will give you the following example.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Let's assume that the chief engineer of one of the enterprises is retiring and it is necessary to find a replacement.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
What did the chief engineer think about?

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Having worked in the company for many years, he said that there is one candidate, there is Vasya,

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
because Vasya has golden hands, he can do everything, and he is worthy of taking my place.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
What can happen after that?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Vasya can be appointed to a position.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Will he be successful? Will he not be successful? It is not clear.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
What other way of development can there be in this situation, if there is a competence model in the company?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
The staff manager can offer several more candidates to his position together with the chief engineer.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
It can be Vasya, Petya and Fedya.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
The next step will be to evaluate the candidates' profile data.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
What is the competence profile?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Not the current position, in which they work, for example, as mechanics or someone else,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
but the profile of the position of the chief engineer.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
What is the profile of the position of the chief engineer?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
In addition to professional competencies, it is a block of management competencies.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
Vasya has golden hands, and from the point of view of professional competencies, he is the best in the company.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
But this does not mean that his competence profile, from the point of view of the profile of the position of the chief engineer, will be better.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
And maybe Petya, who is number two, or number three,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
and whose hands are not golden, and he cannot fix something like Vasya,

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
from the point of view of management competencies, he will be the best, because he knows how to deal with people,

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
he knows how to set tasks, he understands a certain system of work in the service of the chief engineer,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and he understands how to improve it, optimize it, and so on.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Therefore, the best candidate of the three will be Petya.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
If we assign Vasya, then, perhaps, after some time, Vasya, having not worked with other managers,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
and he will already become the chief engineer, and he will be surrounded by line managers,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
with whom he used to work only as a subordinate.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
If he is not successful, what can be his fate?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Most likely, he will leave the company.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes, he is unlikely to return to his previous place.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Thus, we will lose a good mechanic and will not acquire a chief engineer.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
This is the case when a staff manager can participate in decision-making

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and be responsible for their wrong decision.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
If the situation goes down the wrong path, then the care of a good specialist

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
can be blamed on the staff.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Therefore, it is necessary to understand that using, having, using and using this tool,

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
we become responsible and participate in making all decisions that take place in the company.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
If we recall the staff management system, then the competence model,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
if it is developed uniformly for the entire company,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
what we called a core model some time ago,

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
which is used in all practices and procedures of staff management,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
it is applied in almost every direction.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
Once again, we select employees, we assess their behavior using competence,

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
we develop, we work with corporate culture when we formulate corporate competencies.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
Thus, in almost every direction, we use the competencies that we have created.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
I want to tell you about an interesting and necessary method in our activities.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
This is a method of paired comparison of competencies.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
When do we need it?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Look, we have developed 12 competencies,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
and we need to assess the employees of some department.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
There can be 30 employees.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Maybe more, maybe less, of course, but maybe more.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
To assess 30 employees of 12 competencies,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
it is necessary to spend a lot of time.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Therefore, the question always arises,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
what competencies are the most important?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Maybe we should focus on them?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
The same thing with selection.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The same 12 competencies.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
A large number of candidates must be interviewed.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And we always want to ask ourselves,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
what competencies are critical?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
What exactly can we refuse?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
What are we ready to learn within the company?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
What are we not ready to answer?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What competencies do we buy from the market,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
inviting this specialist?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Thus, the question of arranging competencies arises.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And the method of paired comparison is very well applied.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It is important to remember the following.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
We assess competencies for each other

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
for a certain position,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
which is necessary for the future period of time.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
We always appeal to the future,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
not to what is today,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
but to what will be needed tomorrow.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
What is this method?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Its essence is that each competency

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
is consistently compared with another.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Competencies are compared with each other

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
by asking the question,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
what is more important for an employee

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
to be successful in this position?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Which one? Competency 1 or Competency 2?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
If our answer is that it is more important to have Competency 1,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
then this competency is awarded 2 points.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
If we find it difficult to choose,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
because both competencies are important,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
then both competencies get 1 point each.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
If Competency 2 is more important,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
and Competency 1, which we assess, is less important,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
then Competency 1 gets 0 points.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Let's look at this with you as an example.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I would like to draw your attention to the slide with an example.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
This slide consistently compares

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
5 competencies with each other.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Strategic thinking,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
team building, adaptation to changes,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
process management,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and result-oriented.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
How do we do it?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Let's follow it and see together.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
First of all, a certain position is defined.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Let it be the position of the head of the staff,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
to illustrate our example.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
First of all, Competency 1 is compared to Competency 2.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Strategic thinking is compared to team building.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
What is the priority for this position?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
It is clear that each of you can answer in different ways.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
One will say that strategy is everything.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
The other will say that team is everything.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
We say that this is an example,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
and the goal of this example is to show how points are distributed in the table.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Therefore, in our example, these competencies are equally important.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Thus, Competency 1 is a strategic thinking.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
If we assess it,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
then we go from left to right.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
This competency gets 1 point.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
We see that in the cell we write 1.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
After that, we compare strategic thinking to the competency adaptation to changes.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What do we see?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
These competencies are equally important.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Therefore, Competency 1 is 1 point.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
After that, we compare strategic thinking to the competency of process management.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
We see that Competency 1 is more important than process management for the head of the staff.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Thus, Strategic Thinking gets 2 points.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
After that, we compare Competency 2 with the last competency,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
which is the result-oriented.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
We see that the result-oriented is more important.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Therefore, Strategic Thinking gets 0 points.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
Thus, in our analysis, Strategic Thinking got 4 points.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
After that, we go down to the line and start analyzing the creation of the team.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
We compare the team with the strategic thinking.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
We see it and write 1 there.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
After that, we compare the team with the adaptation to changes.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
We see that the team-creation competency is more important.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Therefore, it gets 2 points, and the adaptation to changes gets 0.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Also, the team-creation is more important than process management,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
but less important than the result-oriented.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Accordingly, we assign 2 and 0 points.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Thus, the team-creation competency in total gets 5 points.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
We go down to the line and start analyzing the adaptation to changes.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
We have already compared it with the strategic thinking,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
the team-creation, and now we have to compare it with only 2 competencies.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Process management and the result-oriented.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
We say that in comparison with both competencies,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
the adaptation to changes competencies are equally important.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Therefore, they get 1 point each.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
The total point that the adaptation to changes gets is 3 points.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's move on to the process management.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
We have to compare the process management only with the result-oriented,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
because we have already compared it with all other competencies.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
It was not important in comparison with the strategic thinking and the team-creation.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
It got 1 point when it was about the adaptation to changes.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Accordingly, comparing it with the result-oriented,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
the process management gets 2 points, because it is the most important.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
In total, the process management gets 3 points.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Once again, this is an example.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
In a company, for a certain position,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
the result-oriented will be more important than the process management.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
This is an example to illustrate this method.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
When we get to the result-oriented,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
we have already compared this competency with all other competencies.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We remember that it was more important than the strategic thinking,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
than the team-creation.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
It was about the adaptation to changes and gave way to the process management.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
In total, this competency got 5 points.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
Thus, we have two competencies that are the priority in this list.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What are these competencies?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
These are the competencies that got 5 points.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
They are the team-creation and the result-oriented.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Thus, out of the five competencies that we have,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
we have determined two of the most important.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Maybe we needed three of the most important.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Then, this competency will be the strategic thinking,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
which got 4 points.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Please note that we use this method

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
to determine the priority competencies for a specific position.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
For example, these are two priority competencies

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
for the position of the head of the staff.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
For the position of the logistics manager,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
the priority competencies may be completely different.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Using this method, we make our activities a little easier.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
If we need to find a specialist for this position,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
we will understand that these competencies are the priority competencies.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It is important for us that a person is a team player,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
that he can create a team, and we will teach him the rest.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
If he is not a team player,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
then, unfortunately, the level of development will not be high,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and he will not join our company.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We will not make him an offer.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
We start talking about the application of competencies in our companies.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
We start talking about the evaluation of the staff,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
about the use of competencies when conducting evaluation procedures.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
What are the goals of evaluation activities?

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
The first goal is to evaluate the current level of competence development,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
the required level, and its compliance.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
The second goal is to select people for the future staff reserve

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
and create individual development plans for them.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
The next goal is to create a training program for employees

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
based on the results of evaluation activities.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
The next goal is to correct compensation packages

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
for employees who have successfully completed evaluation activities.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
As we have already discussed at the very beginning,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
there is no single terminology in our professional community.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Therefore, in literature,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
you can often find terms that are equated as synonyms.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Evaluation of activity, evaluation of competencies, etc.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
In fact, at least for yourself,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
it is necessary to understand that evaluation procedures are divided.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Either we evaluate the activity,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
which in English sounds like performance appraisal,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
we evaluate the effectiveness of our employees.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
And the second is when we evaluate their behavior.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That is, evaluation of competencies.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Or we conduct an assessment center,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
as we have already discussed,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
taking this word for Russian,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and taking it into our professional language.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
In our companies, these things can go hand in hand.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
We evaluated a little how the employee achieved his results

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
and the goals that were set by his manager in the past.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And we evaluate competencies for a long time.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Again, it all depends on our tasks.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
But it is important to remember that evaluation of activity is what?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And it answers the question, what did the employee do?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Evaluation of competencies answers the question,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
how were these results achieved?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
When we combine these two assessments,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
we get very important information.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Let's imagine a situation when the head of the department comes,

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
let's say sales, since we often mention this department today,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
and says that something is not sold well,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
the plan is always fulfilled 80-85%.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It seems to be being fulfilled, and not the worst indicator,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
but something is not reaching.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Conduct a training, and he provides a request to the staff manager.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
The staff manager, having taken this request,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
starts to call training companies,

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
and training companies come and conduct training for employees of the sales department.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Probably, what is important, they adapt it to a specific specificity.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Is it a real option?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Of course, it is real.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It often happens.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Often.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But if we use the assessment of competencies,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
what can we see?

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
We can see that the department in general fulfills the plan 80-85%, as we said.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But each of the department employees lacks something of their own.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
One person knows the product poorly, he is constantly confused.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Another person knows the product well, but when the client says it is expensive,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
he falls into a stupor and cannot answer anything,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
thinking about himself that it is really expensive.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That is, he does not know how to work with objections.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Another person, having carried out a single sale,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
cannot establish a relationship with the client.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
He starts looking for new ones,

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
and thus the post-sale service is not performed well and efficiently.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Thus, if we assess the competencies of the employees of this department,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
we will see a different level of development of different competencies.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
And by and large, we will offer this manager not a single program for everyone,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
but we will show that each employee lacks something of their own.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
And by and large, each employee should be sent to either his own training,

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
or specific things should be paid attention to in his work.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
This is the situation when we will talk about individual development plans.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Therefore, once again, we will talk about the assessment of competencies today.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
That is, exactly how.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
This assessment of competencies should always be carried out in a system of assessment of staff,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
where the assessment of activity is an important element.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
That is, what was achieved.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
So, when conducting assessment events, we must meet several conditions.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
First of all, we need to determine the goal for which we are conducting the assessment.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
What results we want to get and how we will use these results.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
We must always remember that assessment events are not conducted for themselves,

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
but for some subsequent actions for the purpose of making some management decision.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Next, it is important that the selected assessment procedures meet the goals.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
We will talk about the procedures a little later, including methods.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Next, it is important that there are competent people, competent assessors.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
This can be both internal specialists and external specialists.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
In any case, those who will assess our employees should have competencies in this area.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
It often happens that employees of the staff do everything, and select, and train, and assess.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Probably, there are such specialists, but still there are not so many of them.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
Therefore, it is important to ensure that our task is that the professionals are engaged in assessment.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Next, it is important to conduct preliminary explanatory work with employees.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Explain to them the goals of the assessment, explain their benefits, what they can get.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
I do not recommend you to do an assessment that can involve some,

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
especially the first time, unpopular management decisions.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Do not give, do not fire, and so on.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Although it is not so simple, nevertheless, when employees know that they will not get something,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
it is better to always go the other way around.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
What can an employee get, what are his benefits, so that he participates and does not resist these procedures.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
Next, it is a qualitative preparation of content, that is, their cases, exercises, role-playing games, and so on.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
We will talk about them a little now.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So, what are the methods of assessment?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
There are many methods, different methods, many of them you know.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.000
The first is the filling of assessment sheets or conducting a survey with a 360-degree method.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
What is 360 degrees?

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
This is a situation when an employee is assessed by the manager, his colleague, his subordinate,

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
if he has one, and the employee assesses himself.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
That is, a kind of circular assessment.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
In this case, if we have competencies, then the employee is assessed according to the competencies.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
When we are in the assessment sheets, we provide all the indicators that we have developed,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
and we ask to choose our evaluators, managers, whether it is a colleague or a subordinate,

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
what kind of employee you assess, what behavior he shows in his work.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And those who assess, they indicate.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
The value of this assessment is that it is most often objective.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Of course, it happens when a subordinate wants to flatter the manager,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
or the manager, having a certain tooth on the subordinate, can somehow lower the rating.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
In any case, when it comes to assessment, let's say, from four sides,

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
the assessment will be balanced in some way, and we will receive information for analysis.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
The next is an interview.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
What kind of interview?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
An interview, again, on competencies.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
When the interviewer sits down with the employee and begins to ask him questions

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
about the situations that were in his professional life,

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
which took place, with questions about how this person behaved at one time or another,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
what was the result of this behavior.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
The goal of this interview is to gather the standards of behavior,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
how a person behaves most often.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
If we assess the managerial competencies of an employee,

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
and in his story there are few examples of how he showed these management competencies,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
we can draw two conclusions.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
The first is that the employee is not developed for some reason.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But there may be another conclusion,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
that the employee does not have the opportunity to apply these competencies in our organization.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
We taught him, taught him, taught him.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
He can, but we did not give him resources.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
He has no one to manage.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Thus, we will take this into account,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
and in subsequent exercises, using other methods of assessment,

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
we will see how in a certain game, when solving certain tasks,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
how the employee will show himself and his competencies in this situation.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
The next method is testing.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Either we test to assess professional knowledge,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
and then it is from the field of professional competencies,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
as a first step.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Our goal is to understand whether employees do this,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
but first we assess whether he knows what to do and how to do it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Or these are psychological tests,

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
which are often used by specialists who know how to do it.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Or these are psychological tests,

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
which are also used as tools in our work.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
The next method is solving tasks or cases.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Most often these are individual exercises,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
these are individual tasks, either written tasks or oral tasks,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
when it is necessary to analyze a situation,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
to offer your vision, to offer your decision.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Based on this, we, acting as assessors,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
can draw conclusions about the preparation,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
about the professional preparation of the employee,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
if it was a task on a professional topic,

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
and about what competencies he has in the field of information analysis,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and in the field of information presentation,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
if, for example, at the end of this task,

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
he has to make a presentation to the assessment commission.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
The next method is games.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Games can be business or role-playing.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
What is the essence of a role-playing game?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
A role-playing game is, most often, a game

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
in which we analyze a certain invented situation,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
which we set for ourselves.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
We analyze the working, professional behavior of an employee.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
If he works with clients,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
then, accordingly, the role-playing game will be his,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
as a manager, let's say, for sales and a client.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
If we have a task to assess the communication competencies of the manager,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
then we create a role-playing game

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
in which the manager communicates with the manager,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and they must protect their interests,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
achieve their goals,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
and at the same time jointly achieve a compromise.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
A very important point is that

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
if we are preparing a role-playing game,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
then we must prescribe both roles.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
It is clear that these roles will contradict each other in their interests.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
There will always be their minimum and maximum.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Nevertheless, these things need to be coordinated

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
so that neither one of the heroes,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
who we assess,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
nor the one who plays and helps him in this exercise,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
has less opportunities for improvisation.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
The game did not go in any way.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
It is important that if we assess the communication and professional competencies,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
how a person will act in a specific situation,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
with the given resources to achieve the goals that are determined.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
These are role-playing games.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
When it comes to business games,

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
most often we mean games in which a group of people participates,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
a group of assessors.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
They have one common task,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
which they must solve,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
the goal which they must achieve.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The so-called simulation games are very popular now.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
That is, a business situation, a business task,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
in which a group of participants represents one company,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
which is often fictional,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
and which must achieve the goals with the resources they have.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
This method is gaining more and more popularity

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
and is being used very actively to assess the leaders of the middle and upper ranks.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Because during such games,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the leaders are very open,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
and we can observe their behavior.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
The next method is group exercises or discussions.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
When it is necessary to discuss a task,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
or discuss a situation,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
come to a single decision,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
or when a controversy is organized on a controversial topic,

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
it is necessary to understand how the participants participate in such group discussions

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
and solve group exercises.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It is very important that during assessment procedures

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
it is important to assess the behavior that is really observable,

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
and not to think why the employee behaves in a proper way,

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
that is, not to analyze hypotheses about his reasons.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Thus, in a group of experts,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
when an assessment commission is formed,

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
both internal specialists and specialists from the outside are often attracted.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
On the one hand, the internal specialist knows a lot,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
he knows the corporate spirit, he knows the environment, he knows corporate slang,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
and he will be an assistant in the event of a situation

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
when the same behavior can be interpreted in different ways.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
For example, we will call one person an economist,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
if he is our friend,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and if he is not our friend,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
how can we call him?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
We can call him a miser.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
The characteristics are different,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
but the observed behavior can be similar.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
It is the internal experts who will help us identify the observed behavior in a proper way,

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
and the external experts will help us, let's say,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
to be free from the story that we know about the participants.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
When you look and understand that in life he behaves differently,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
probably he is tired, or has not slept,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
or has not yet understood where he is,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
but he is actually different.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
An external expert will never allow us to do this,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
he will always rely on the behavior he observes,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
and will pay our attention to this.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Very often in literature we meet and talk about such a method as a center of assessment.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
What is a center of assessment?

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
First of all, this term is a translation of the English term assessment center,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
which we also use in our professional terminology.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
It is important to understand that the classical assessment center,

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
which was introduced in Russia about 10 years ago by leading Western consulting companies,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
includes a certain set of exercises.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
This is a kind of a set of methods,

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
thanks to which we assess the behavior and the level of competence development that employees have.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Now, in corporate practice, we understand different things under the assessment center.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
We combine two different methods and call it an assessment.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
Nevertheless, there are some standards of the assessment center,

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
which should be taken into account even when we adapt it to our corporate tasks.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Most often, the assessment lasts 1-2 days.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
The assessment is carried out based on the model of competence that exists.

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
Assessment is practically impossible to conduct without formulated competencies.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
Next, competencies must be interconnected with the success of the work.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
These are not just some competencies taken from somewhere,

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
these are the competencies that ensure the successful performance of the work.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
How many participants can be?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
There should be no more than 7 participants,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
otherwise it will be difficult to observe them.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
Or it can be 2 times 7, if we are talking about two groups and a large number of participants that we need to assess.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
It is important to remember that there is such a concept as an individual assessment center,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
in which one employee participates.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
When can this be?

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Most often, we use it when selecting staff.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
When our company invites a top manager to work,

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
and we know a lot about his professional competencies,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
because he is known on his market,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
and we attract him with the help of the agency,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
we should not make a mistake,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
because the cost of the mistake will be quite high.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
And we can offer, if we have a need for this,

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
to order an individual assessment center for this top manager,

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
during which we will assess his management and corporate competencies,

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
how much their level corresponds to our company.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
For example, he can tell us during the interview that he is a team player,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
that the interests of the team are the most important for him.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
And this can correspond to what we have, and we want to hear it.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
If the center is well organized, it is likely that it will not be conducted.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
And we can see that this is not the person who,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
having reached the gates, using football terminology,

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
will give the last pass and score a goal for his teammate.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
He will still strive to do it himself.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
And so we will see that a person declares that he is interested in work,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
he declares his team spirit.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Maybe he even wants to be like that.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
Nevertheless, in his work, he is an individualist and tries to do everything himself.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
This is a good quality, but in our example, not for our position.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
This is about the number of participants.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
Next, the observers, that is, the assessors,

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
if we use American terminology.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
There should be several observers, not one or two.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
It is clear that their number directly depends on the number of participants.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
If this is an individual assessment, then there will be enough two observers.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
If these are groups, then most often there are three, four, five,

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
among which, I repeat, there are both involved specialists from outside,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
and our internal employees.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
What do the observers do?

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
The observers analyze the behavior that the participants of the assessment center

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
show during the exercises.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
And everyone observes no more than two participants.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
Because it's not that easy to observe, interpret, analyze the behavior you see.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Sometimes in different exercises, observers change participants.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.000
It's not that the observer takes two participants and looks at them for two days.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
No, in this exercise, he looks at these two, in the next exercise, he looks at others.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
It is important to understand that, as we have already said,

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
the success of assessment procedures depends on the fulfillment of the exercises that our employees solve.

33:18.000 --> 33:27.000
Therefore, more than 90% of the exercises should imitate professional activity.

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
And a maximum of 5-10% can be psychological exercises.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
Because, again, our task is to assess the work behavior.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
And we can assess the work behavior by creating the most characteristic conditions,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
that is, the environment in which employees work every day.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
The execution of each exercise, of course, is limited in time.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
And in each exercise there are no more than four competencies.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Even if we try to analyze eight competencies,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
which we have determined and included in our corporate model,

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
in any case, one exercise demonstrates no more than four.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
And, no less important, each competence must be checked in several exercises, in two or three.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
We can see, for example, how the employee behaves during the group work,

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
analyze, look, then recheck our suspicions, our thoughts about how he behaved in another exercise,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and in this one he behaves the same.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
And if his behavior is repeated, then we can say that, yes,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
competencies are demonstrated at this level.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
If the behavior changes for some reason,

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
maybe he was first constrained, squeezed, and then realized that there was nothing wrong,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
and opened up completely,

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
then we just suggest and observe his behavior in various exercises more closely.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
An important recommendation is that each participant must be provided with feedback.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Feedback can be different.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
It can be a well-prepared and structured plan of individual development,

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
or just a few words about what a person should pay attention to.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
But in any case, feedback should be there,

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
and the more it is, the better it is for our project.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's talk about what exercises we use when holding the assessment center.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
First of all, it can be group exercises or individual exercises.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
If we talk about group exercises,

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
then it can be two types of exercises that we use most often.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
These are exercises with distributed roles and with non-distributed roles.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
What's the difference?

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
The difference is that if in the case of a group exercise with non-distributed roles,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
the task is received by a group,

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
and the task of the observer is to analyze how each of the participants behaves

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
in a situation that is not specifically set for him, but for the group.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
And then the participants are analyzed.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Who will organize the group and say,

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
do as I do, write on the flip chart, go there, take this, and so on.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
Who will be the most silent, but at the end will say three phrases

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
that will change the course of the group's work,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
and the group will make a decision and see this person.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
In this case, if the roles are distributed,

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
then this is a situation when the roles that are offered to the participants are a little contradictory.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And everyone has their own goal,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
it can be a common group, it can be within the group,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
when the participants need to agree with each other,

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
have the resources that are set, and have some restrictions that also exist.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
Individual exercises can also be different.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It can be either a presentation,

36:57.000 --> 37:04.000
when the participant needs to familiarize himself with the package of information provided,

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
he needs to analyze this information and make a decision,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
presenting it to the evaluation commission.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It can be a role-playing game,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
which refers to individual exercises, which we have already talked about.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
It can be an exercise to find facts,

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
when the participant is given a brief description of a problem,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
a situation that needs to be solved,

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
and he has the opportunity to ask a number of questions to the members of the evaluation commission,

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
asking for the necessary information that he needs to solve this exercise.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
It can be an individual business exercise,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
which is called an intray,

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
or you can look up the name in the Internet and in the literature,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
as in a basket or in a folder.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
The point is that the participant receives a certain package of information,

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
it can be of completely different types,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
and his task is to solve the task that is set for him.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
For example, it can be our reservist,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
whom we are preparing for the role of the future leader.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Thus, he receives some information,

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
some correspondence, some documentation of his internal leader.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
If the leader is not present and he is on a business trip,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
he needs to analyze all the information and solve it.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
It can be within the framework of one unit,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
when there is a task to answer,

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
the client asks for a discount or he has stopped the supply of products.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
It is necessary to identify whether the decision was made correctly or incorrectly,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
and in the absence of imitation,

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
it is necessary to read the documents that confirm and illustrate

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
the history of cooperation with this client,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
and assess whether it was a right decision or not,

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
and take responsibility for his acceptance.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The question is,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
all this is great, the exercises are different,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
where to get them from?

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
If the task is to hold an assessment center for reservists

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
and select candidates for the personnel reserve,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
where to get the exercises?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
There are several options.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
If you invite professionals, professional consultants,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
representatives of consulting or training companies,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
your partners will come with a package of exercises,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
which they will either use,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
or when certain agreements are reached,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
they will leave them for your future work.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
Very often consultants develop exercises with you,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
helping you do this,

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
already adapting the existing exercises to your corporate practice.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
If you want to do it yourself,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
you will never find the exercises that you need.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Develop them.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
The question is who develops them?

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
Again, together with the managers and leading experts.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Because all the most difficult situations that could happen,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
many of them have already happened.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And there is always a story.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Do you remember how difficult it was,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
what conflict arose, how we solved it?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And there are always such stories,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
practically legends in all departments.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Therefore, the task of the staff is to describe them

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and create some exercises from them.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Be it an exercise to find facts,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
or describe some role-playing game,

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
or to come up with a situation for analysis,

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
in order to understand how the future participant of the assessment center

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
will act in a given situation.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
It is clear that if you send a letter to the manager,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
saying that you need to describe how it all happened,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
because you need it for your future exercise,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
probably not everyone will answer,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
because it is not always easy to formulate and write.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Therefore, it is advisable to work together.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It can be a specialist of the staff,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
it can be a specialist engaged in training,

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
who simply comes with certain guiding questions to the manager

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
and just collects these examples.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
And after a while you will have your own library of exercises,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
which you will periodically update,

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
periodically you will add the most interesting exercises,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
exclude something and modify them.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
Then you can say that a certain library has been developed,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
a certain portfolio of tasks that you use

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
to assess your competencies in completely different exercises.
