00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello, colleagues.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Today we will talk about a topic that can be called one of the most

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
perturbing, if not the most perturbing, in the entire system of staff management.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Because we are talking about money.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We understand that money is such a thing that interests everyone, or almost everyone.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
It interests us as HR people, it interests us as representatives of the employer,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
and, of course, it is very interesting for the employees of our enterprises.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
We will consider this topic from different angles, because, despite its extreme complexity,

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
it can be divided into a number of rather simple elements.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Our task is to learn to see these elements, understand how they work,

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
and effectively connect a single system of staff management of our enterprise.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
To do this, we will touch on three main global topics.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
The first is to consider the stimulation of labor payment in the context of enterprise management as a whole.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
What are the possibilities, what are the restrictions, what are the open patterns,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
what can be used here, and so on.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
The second is to look at the specific tools of stimulation of labor.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
It seems that there are not so many of them, as it might seem,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
but each of them can take on very different forms.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
In the third part, we will consider how these tools can be used in the context of a specific organization

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
to solve its problems and to create a system of stimulation of labor in the organization as a whole

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
and for the most frequently meeting positions.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
To be honest, I would like to start this lesson with a little anecdote.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Imagine a picture. A young man, a manager, comes to work.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
He asks a social worker, what is your social package?

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
The worker says, as it should be under the labor code.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
We pay for vacations, hospitals, and that's it.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
Yes, but in the place where I used to work, I had a paid car, paid cellular communication,

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
vacation twice a year, paid trips to the Bahamas, food, education for children, medical insurance.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
So why did you leave such a wonderful place?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
The company went bankrupt.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Strictly speaking, everything we will discuss here is about one global topic.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
How to make people in the organization work,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
to make them like it, to make them work effectively,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
not to leave the organization, that is, to be loyal to it,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
and at the same time not to let the company go bankrupt.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So, let's start.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
First, we need to consider some basic concepts related to our topic.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
There are only four of them.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
These are labor motivation, labor stimulation, compensation, and labor satisfaction.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Unfortunately, in practice, they are often confused with each other.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
So let's agree on what we will call in the future, so that we can speak the same language.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So, labor motivation is the broadest concept,

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
which refers to some internal mechanism of a human personality,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
which determines what a person will do at work,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
and whether he will work at all, and why he does it.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
When I said internal mechanisms,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
I didn't mean to deceive you, but I distorted the situation a little,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
because this internal thing is closely related to the external one.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
It is easy to understand that the motivation of a worker in the 1930s,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
a machine operator at a factory,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
and the motivation of a modern manager who works in the market conditions

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
are slightly different.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
But we will not go into this topic.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
We all know the theory of motivation,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
starting from the famous Pyramid of Oil,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
the hierarchy of needs,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
ending with modern theories of motivation.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
We will not consider them.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I hope you will read about it or learn about it in other parts of our course.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
The second concept is labor stimulation.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Stimulation is the whole set of factors,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
the whole set of conditions that a worker creates

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
to make the motivation of a worker as effective as possible.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Compensation is part of stimulation.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
If stimulation includes both moral and material aspects,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
then compensation, when we say this expression,

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
we usually mean what our worker gets from the work of the employer in a natural form.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
In the form of money, goods or services.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Here again there is a little subtlety,

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
because, as you know, the division of moral and material is also quite conditional.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
Imagine that I paid you a bonus of 28 kopecks.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
How would you feel about it?

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
You will probably perceive it as an insult.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
So, bonuses, material factors are a signal that the employer sends to his worker.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
A signal about how he feels about his worker and what he thinks about him.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
On the other hand, the so-called moral factors also require costs.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Imagine that we organized a corporate party.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
We have the New Year, or March 8, or the day of our company, the birthday.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
A corporate holiday.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
It is believed that this is primarily a moral factor, which brings people together, and so on.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But how much money is spent on this?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
In other words, material factors always have a moral side,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and moral factors require material costs.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
And finally, the concept of satisfaction with work.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
There is a common view that a person must be satisfied with work, and then everything will be fine.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
As you know, there are 6-12 different factors that determine the satisfaction with work.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
I will note that compensation is only one of them,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
although far from the last, usually one of the first, but not always the first.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
There is one unpleasant moment.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
There is a phenomenon called the phenomenon of contentment.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
When people at work are absolutely satisfied, they do not need anything,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
they live very well and happily, but the efficiency is practically zero.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Therefore, satisfaction with work is a reflection of people,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
a reflection in the public consciousness of our company employees of whether they are doing well or not.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
But to what extent this satisfaction affects the efficiency of their work is the second question.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Of course, one thing can be said for sure,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
that unsatisfied workers will most likely work poorly,

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
but I am afraid that satisfied workers will be good, and this is not always the case.

07:36.000 --> 07:46.000
Like any management system, the compensation system that we will talk about can be more or less effective.

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
Let's consider the criteria that determine the effectiveness of the work stimulation system at the enterprise,

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
or rather the signs that we can judge how effective or ineffective this system is.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
The first and foremost is, of course, the adequate level of quality and productivity of work at the enterprise.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
If these indicators, the quality of work, the quality of work,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
the productivity of work, are much lower than in the industry,

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
or in the relatively similar working sectors of the market and enterprises,

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
then something is probably not quite right with our system, and we need to study what is happening to it.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
The second indicator or criterion of effectiveness is the stability of the staff.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
It is clear that if people are not satisfied with their work,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
they are not satisfied with the local work,

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
they do not like the stimulation system, then most likely they will leave it.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
As a result, increased flow of staff occurs,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
when many people come, many people leave, the staff is unstable,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
and because of this, the enterprise actually loses a lot of money,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
because people have to be looked for, it costs money,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
people have to be trained, it costs money again,

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
sometimes important areas are neglected, and this must be somehow compensated for.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Therefore, the flow of staff is certainly not a very good indicator,

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
and, as a rule, it is explained by the poor quality of stimulation of work at the enterprise, but not always.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
And if the staff is stable or relatively stable?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Now we will have to touch on another very important criterion,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
which is quite rarely mentioned,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
but, unfortunately, it has a very strong impact on the performance and quality of work at our enterprise.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
An effective stimulation system should lead not only to people working well,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
but also to the fact that the weak employees leave the enterprise first of all,

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
employees who do not bring the enterprise what it should bring,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
and the strong ones should stay at the same time.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
In other words, an effective stimulation system should contribute to the elimination of weak employees from the company

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
and to the preservation of strong employees in the company.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
But, unfortunately, we often observe the opposite process.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It turns out that strong employees systematically leave the company,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
and even more offensively, employees who were trained by the enterprise,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
invested funds in them, and the weak ones remain,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
and the opposite problem arises, how to get rid of the weak ones,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
but then there will be no one to work at all.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
The next criterion is how easily and effectively vacancies are filled.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
If the threshold of our organization is the number of people willing to work in it,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
then our stimulation system is adequate,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
and we have a positive reputation as a employer in the labor market.

10:42.000 --> 10:52.000
But if our HR department cannot fill important vacancies for a month, two, three, four,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
then, most likely, something is also wrong with the stimulation system.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
People come, find out what conditions we have, and leave immediately.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
They do not like these conditions, and someone can offer better ones.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
The next and last factor, which is not very common to talk about,

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
but it is necessary, is the theft and abuse of our employees.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
There is an old saying from Soviet times,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
they steal what we do not pay them.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
If the organization, consciously or unconsciously,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
does not provide the right level of stimulation for its staff,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
and the staff is forced to compensate for this by theft,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
then this is probably not a very good sign.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Usually, if you count, the damage to the enterprise from all this mischief

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
greatly covers the savings on labor payment and other factors of stimulation.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
So, these are the five factors, five criteria,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
which show how effective our stimulation system is,

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
and how effective the system of compensation management is.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
The first thing to say is the management.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
Management means that the management knows well how much it pays to employees,

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
how much it spends on staff, why it spends so much,

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
and can, if necessary, adjust these costs, increase or decrease.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
The opposite picture is when the organization does not know

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
how much it spends on staff.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Maybe it will seem surprising to you,

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
but in our enterprises this situation is very common.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
The fact is that many of our enterprises, both small and large,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
which emerged after the 1990s,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
went through certain stages of development.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
At the early stages, the stimulation system, the labor payment system,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
was not very needed.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
There were few people, everyone did everything, take more, throw more,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
and as a result, the labor payment system was built on the system of personal agreements.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
More precisely, on the non-system of personal agreements.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
And now, if this has not changed in the organization,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
if we look at how much the organization pays to employees in different positions,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
it turns out that there is no system here.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
There is such a patchwork, which has historically developed.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Why is that? Where did it come from? Nobody understands.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
And of course, it is difficult to recognize such a system as effective.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
The second is the clarity of the reward system, the stimulation system for employees.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
An employee must understand what he gets more for,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
what he gets less for, and what he gets in general.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Then he will know what behavior is maintained in this company, and what is the opposite.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
It turns out that the reward either does not correspond to the achievements and results,

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
or it comes too late, and the employee does not see the connection between the reward and the results of his work.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
So this clarity is a necessary factor without which the system cannot be effective.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
The next is the combination of the reward system of material and moral factors.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
That is, we must understand what signals we send to the workers,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
providing a particular system of labor stimulation.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
Let's say we pay a person a percentage of the volume of the contracts they have,

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
or a percentage, a certain amount, of the number of products they have produced.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Thus, we send a very simple signal.

14:54.000 --> 15:03.000
We are only interested in how a machine for money production or production of parts, products, and nothing else.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Will such a person work effectively?

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
For some time, yes, but until another employer offers him better conditions.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Therefore, it is necessary to closely monitor how people perceive the reward system,

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
the stimulation system, and ensure an adequate combination of material and moral factors in one system.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
The next extremely important external factor in relation to our enterprise,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
we cannot control it, but we can control it.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
This is the correspondence of the reward system with the labor market.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
The market is the market.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
We will deal with it separately.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
The market, market criteria are some of the most important for the formation of a system of stimulation on the enterprise.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
We will talk about it in detail separately.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Unfortunately, we see a picture when the labor market is changing.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
It is changing very quickly in the 10s of the 21st century, and many organizations simply do not have time for it.

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
I must note that paying the market value both lower and higher is equally harmful for the enterprise.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Why? You probably already guessed, if we recall the anecdote I told at the beginning.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
The next factor that determines the effectiveness of the stimulated staff is the compliance with the enterprise goals.

16:27.000 --> 16:41.000
This means that the stimulation system must reinforce the behavior of the worker that meets our needs and what we want from the worker,

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
and vice versa, so that this system does not punish or reward the behavior that we do not need.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Can it be that the stimulation system does not meet the enterprise goals?

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
It can. There are many cases when the stimulation system encourages the worker to behave in a way that is not necessary for the enterprise.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
We will consider examples with you.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
A little later.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
The next extremely important factor, but I would say one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible, is the factor of justice.

17:15.000 --> 17:25.000
Justice is objective, that is, a person should probably get more for more qualified, more difficult, more responsible work,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
than for less qualified, responsible, difficult and difficult.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
But there is also a subjectively understandable factor of justice.

17:34.000 --> 17:43.000
How much does a person, a worker, and the employees of our enterprise perceive the payment of labor, the stimulation system,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
as fair in relation to themselves or not fair?

17:47.000 --> 17:57.000
The first thing that probably determines this feeling of justice is a situation when more productive, productive and quality work is rewarded

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
higher than less productive, productive and quality.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
Unfortunately, in many enterprises we see a level playing field, when no matter how you work, you will not earn more,

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
and an efficient person gets the same as his neighbor, who, so to speak, does not really strain at work.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
This, of course, should be avoided in every possible way.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
And finally, the last thing I would like to dwell on is the reward system, the stimulation system,

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
which should reward both individual and general results of the worker,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
in the company as a whole, in the division, in the working group, in the department, in the collective.

18:37.000 --> 18:47.000
If only individual results are rewarded, this often leads to very unproductive effects in the form of internal competition between workers.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, imagine that one sales manager rejects an order from another sales manager only to earn more.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And the company loses on this.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
It loses its reputation among clients, both in profitability and in everything else.

19:02.000 --> 19:11.000
Therefore, it is necessary to closely monitor that both individual and general results are rewarded harmoniously.

19:11.000 --> 19:20.000
And there are such roles in an organization that should be stimulated and rewarded exclusively on individual results.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
I mean managers, and, first of all, managers of the front line,

19:24.000 --> 19:32.000
because their task is to ensure the workability, resultivity, quality of the work of the team, group, team.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
If we have a great, wonderful manager and he himself works very effectively,

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
but for some reason his team does not work very well, what should we reward?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And do we need such a manager at all?

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
So, we want to manage the labor stimulation system at the enterprise.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
What does it mean to manage?

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
The axiom of the theory of management is that the object of management should be managed.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
That is, what will we manage?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And the subject of management, that is, who should do it?

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
The first and second questions about the labor stimulation system are quite complicated.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Let's try to find an answer to them.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
First, let's start with the subject, who will manage?

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
The fact is that the labor stimulation system permeates the entire enterprise from top to bottom.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
It concerns all employees and each in its own department.

20:28.000 --> 20:36.000
Therefore, it is very difficult to select one person, one role, one position, who should be engaged in this management.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Therefore, as often happens in modern management, when it comes to all organizations,

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
something is created, conventionally speaking, called a committee.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
In this case, we will talk about the labor payment committee and see what roles are present in it,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
who should participate there and who performs what functions.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
At the same time, we will look at what will happen if one or another member of our committee

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
falls out of the management system.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
The first and foremost is a person who must make a final decision,

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
who must determine the policy of the organization in relation to labor payment

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
and be the main and ultimate in solving the problems and conflicts that may arise in this regard.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
This is none other than the director of the enterprise.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
In English, it will be a CEO, chief executive, and in our case, it is usually a general director.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Can a general director take on all the authority?

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
Of course, he can, but he probably does not have the function of responsibility for managing the labor payment system,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
because he has many other tasks.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
If he is only engaged in labor payment, then who will be engaged in production,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
who will be engaged in the implementation of products and financial services?

21:51.000 --> 22:00.000
Therefore, a certain character is needed, who will combine all the main functions in his management,

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
leaving the task of making final decisions and determining the direction in which the system will move.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
And this is, of course, HR director, that is, a person who is responsible for working with the staff.

22:15.000 --> 22:24.000
He differs from all other members of our committee in that he is professional, or she is, more often than not,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
he understands what he is doing, listened to our lecture course, at least studied somewhere else,

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
and knows how this system should be managed, what factors should be controlled, how, and so on.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
And the second function, the second role in this system of HR director is the center of responsibility,

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
that is, a person who unites in himself, coordinates the entire management system, responsible for it as a whole.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
In short, a person who has all the information and to whom everyone should come,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
and has the right and opportunity to come for the obtaining of this information.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
The next active person who certainly participates in the management system is the chief accountant.

23:10.000 --> 23:18.000
The fact is that a significant part of the costs that the enterprise carries for maintaining its staff are taxes.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
And in any case, the payment of labor, all the costs that should be incurred by the enterprise,

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
are the prerogatives of the chief accountant.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
This is what interests him, he should do this.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
The next is the financial director.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
The financial director deals with the economy of the enterprise as a whole.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
He understands where the enterprise is moving, what are its plans, how much money the enterprise earns,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
and how effective it is.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
This is not the same as accounting.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
This is a completely different job.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Can you do without a financial director in this case?

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
I'm afraid it will be difficult, because if the financial director does not take part in this process,

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
then we will have a hard time controlling how much money we spend and whether we are doing it right.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Finally, there are also directors in directions.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
These are people who head large structural units of the enterprise.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
The same director of production, the same director of sales, the commercial director.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Do they need to be in this committee?

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
What will happen if they do not take part in its work?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Most likely, nothing good will happen,

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
simply because people will be faced with certain decisions that they may not agree with.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
They see the situation in the directions they are headed in better than others.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Therefore, they should have the right to express their position,

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
their needs, their proposals, and have the right to defend and discuss them.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Such a structure, consisting of a number of active people,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
and the first members of the enterprise, I repeat,

24:59.000 --> 25:09.000
should be engaged in the system of compensation management.

25:09.000 --> 25:17.000
What will happen if we decide that it is enough to give all this to one person?

25:17.000 --> 25:24.000
If it is the director, then his position is probably too high to understand the situation in detail.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
He will probably make decisions that are more likely to be volitional,

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
and I am afraid that the effectiveness of such decisions will not be optimal.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
It often happens that the chief accountant is engaged in the issue of compensation,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
payment of labor, and stimulation.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
The chief accountant is a person of very high qualification.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
He must know a lot, he must be able to do a lot.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
But what he does not have to know is the understanding of the situation in the labor market

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
and the understanding of the basic behavior of people.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
What will happen if the chief accountant takes on the single-person management of the system of compensation management?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I can give a simple example.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
I observed him.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
At the factory, the turner receives 15,627.18 rubles per month,

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
and the next month he will receive 16,325.19 rubles, and so on.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
And a whole staff of workers will calculate these kopecks.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
How effective is this?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Maybe we can do without a financial director?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I am afraid that this will be quite difficult,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
because if we remove him from our management system,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
the system will simply not know how effective it is.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
The accountant cannot calculate this.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Only the financial director can calculate this,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
if only these months are not combined in one person.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
And what will happen if he is entrusted with the management of the system of compensation?

26:50.000 --> 26:57.000
So what will happen if we give the reins of management to the financial director of the enterprise?

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I am afraid that the same problems will arise,

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
which we discussed in the aspect of the chief accountant as the chief acting person.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
The financial director should be engaged in profitability and efficiency,

27:09.000 --> 27:19.000
but not always he is able to combine this with understanding of how the labor market works,

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
how it is arranged, where there are declines in the labor market,

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
where there are drops, where there are surges.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
This is not his duty, he does not have to know this.

27:32.000 --> 27:44.000
He does not have to know how the social, subjective component of the workers' reaction to the labor stimulation system is arranged.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Therefore, it is unlikely that he will be able to cope with such a task effectively.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
And finally, let's take the last acting persons,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
these are the managers, the directors of the management.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
What if we simply give them the reins of management in their hands,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
and let them decide how much to pay their own workers?

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
This may seem paradoxical,

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
but in our country, in most organizations, which once began as small,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
then grew, grew, grew,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
this was observed, and is still observed.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
The manager comes to the director of the enterprise and says,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I urgently need a few more workers,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
or I have a lot of staff, I need to raise people's salaries.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And the director says, please, let's raise them.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
As a result, the system acquires the character of the most gentle blanket,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
which we have already talked about.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Therefore, we are obliged to listen to the directors in the direction,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
we are obliged to understand their position,

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
but if we give them the reins of management of this system in their hands,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
if we completely rely on them in relation to the fact that the system works,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
well, most likely, there will be no big loss,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
because no one has canceled the system of swans, crayfish and pike yet.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
As a result, it turns out that the system either does not manage, does not work,

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
or works, but in a direction in which no one was going to move it.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
It moves by itself, and we look at it and wonder,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
why does it work like this?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I would like it to be different.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
In conclusion, I will say that it is quite rare at enterprises to see

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
such a group of interested and responsible people engaged in the system of labor stimulation.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Unfortunately, in most cases, the distortions, the inefficiency of the system arise

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
precisely because such a community does not exist, it is not coordinated,

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
individual actors either get out of it or take on an unusual role,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
and as a result, we have a loss of efficiency.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
Therefore, if you do not really like how the system of labor stimulation is arranged at your enterprise,

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
please look at who is involved in the management and what functions these people perform.

29:58.000 --> 30:07.000
It is possible that someone is missing, and the subject of the management system will have to be changed.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
We have just discussed with you the question of who should participate in the management of the labor stimulation system.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
We found out that this work is team, collective, and it is necessary to integrate the points of view of very different parties.

30:23.000 --> 30:30.000
Now let's see what factors determine the system of labor payment at the enterprise.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
In general, these factors can be divided into internal factors, those that come from within the company,

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
and external factors, which are not managed by the system, are in the external environment,

30:42.000 --> 30:51.000
and certainly have a great impact on how much we can, must, and should pay our people and spend on the staff as a whole.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
So let's start with the external factors.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
The first main factor is the labor market.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
This is a very complex and interesting thing.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
Now we are in a situation where the labor market is changing very quickly and unpredictably.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
HR directors say that the labor market has gone mad.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
It used to be very easy to find people, but it is very easy to be an attraction.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
It used to be easy enough to find staff.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Quite difficult vacancies were closed for about a month and a half,

31:22.000 --> 31:30.000
but now you have to look for a person for 2-3 months, and it is not always possible to find exactly the one you want and in the conditions that we offer.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
The labor market is an external factor in relation to our company.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
We cannot influence it in any way, we cannot change it,

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
but we can monitor it, as they say now, monitor and control,

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
and understand the situation and change our behavior in the labor market accordingly,

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
because now one of our main tasks is to be an attractive employer in the labor market.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
Why? We will discuss this a little later, when we talk about how the labor market works.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
The second factor is legislation.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
State, municipal and local authorities adopt certain laws or acts,

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
which we must consider in our incentive system if we want to be law-abiding citizens.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
We cannot influence this, but at least we can monitor and control it.

32:22.000 --> 32:32.000
The organization of the chief accountant and lawyer, who understand how it all works and should work, plays a very important role here.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
The next extremely important external factor is economic conjuncture.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
How does the situation in the country's economy, in the world economy, and in general, work?

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
We know that there are ups and downs, market fluctuations.

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
Some market participants earn a lot of money and prosper, others, unfortunately, do not.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
This is not permanent, but temporary.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
In other words, the question of how much we should spend on staff, how much we should pay our employees,

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
largely depends on what is happening in the market around us.

33:14.000 --> 33:26.000
This is a factor that we cannot control, but we must understand and effectively control.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
Finally, this is the situation in the sector of the market in which we work.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
The economy and conjuncture as a whole are good things, but there are changes, ups and downs,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
stagnation, and so on, in certain sectors.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
This should also be understood very well.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Let's move on to internal factors.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
The first and main one is the economy of our enterprise.

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
Why is the issue of staffing costs and the incentive system so important to us?

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
This is one of the main economic indicators of the operation of our enterprise.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
At the same time, staffing costs are one of the main factors.

34:11.000 --> 34:18.000
At some enterprises, they can account for 40-50% of the budget.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
At other enterprises, they can account for 80%.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
But, one way or another, this is a very significant figure.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Here we can recall the old Russian saying,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
go and stretch your legs.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
Maybe I would like to pay my employees a lot and invest a lot of money in them,

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
but, unfortunately, I do not have such funds and I will hardly have them in the near future.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
It is interesting to note that the economy of the company is connected with the level of labor payment

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
and the incentive system as a whole, but not linearly.

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
One might think that big, rich companies pay their employees a lot,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and small and poor companies pay little.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
This is not always the case.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
The fact is that at a large enterprise, especially an industrial enterprise,

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
a lot of money is spent on the maintenance of equipment,

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
buildings, infrastructure, land, and so on.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.000
If an enterprise has nothing but the brains of the people who work there,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
then, of course, the costs can be much higher.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
The second important factor is the personnel policy.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
This is the general principle of our attitude to the personnel,

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
what we think about the personnel, how we treat them,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
what principles we follow.

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
The personnel policy can be summed up in three main points.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
The first is where we get the people who work for us.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
The second is how we treat them.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
And the third is why we part with them.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
It would seem that all this is simple and understandable,

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
but in fact, the personnel policy has a significant degree of subjectivism.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
The executive board only formalizes it.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
It is rather planned or unplanned,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
consciously or not,

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
and, most importantly, it is more or less in line with the personnel policy of the company.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
Unfortunately, it is often far from the personnel policy.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
We will see how it works very soon.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
The next extremely important internal factor

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
that determines the system of labor payment for enterprises

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
is the technology used.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
I mean the technology in the broadest sense of the word,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
starting with the machines and equipment used,

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
the most modern machines that work almost without a person,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
or the good old lathe, the DIP.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
I learned to work on it.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
DIP is a machine that is as good as the American machine.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
It depends on how qualified the lathe is,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
how high the level is, what it can and cannot do.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
I am also talking about information technologies.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Today, this is one of the main problems.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Information technologies, management technologies,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
can do something for a person,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
can replace him,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and, on the contrary,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
can demand higher personnel qualifications.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
Therefore, it is necessary to take into account

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
how much technology used by our company

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
requires a high level of personnel qualification and responsibility,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
and how much, on the contrary, it reduces these requirements.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
This and that should be taken into account

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
in the labor stimulation system.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
The next internal factor that cannot be left out

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
is the opinion of the workers.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Paradoxically, there are organizations

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
where the stimulation system,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
compared to others, is very well done,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and people earn a lot,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
but for some reason they are not satisfied with it.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
They find it boring and uninteresting,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
they come to work,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
and they are well-off,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
they try to come less often,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
if the system allows it.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
But there are opposite situations,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
when they are not paid much,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
and somewhere they could have earned more money.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
However, the atmosphere of the enterprise is such

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
that people are satisfied, happy,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
they like to work here,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
they are proud of their work,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
and I do not want to lure them

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
into the best stimulation system.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It is quite difficult to put it mildly.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
In other words, this is a subjective factor,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
another subjective factor,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
apart from the personnel policy,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
which must be controlled, taken into account,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
and which we can form purposefully.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Who should do this?

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
First of all, the first persons of the enterprise,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
and also in the epicenter, as always,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
should be our great, powerful HR director,

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
who is responsible for the state of the enterprise's labor resources.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And who else?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
And finally, the last factor I would like to discuss

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
is the stage of development

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
at which the enterprise is at the moment.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
You probably know that any organization

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
goes through several stages in its development,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
which can be divided into childhood,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
adolescence, maturity,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
and then, unfortunately,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
there is often a decline.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
How long does this cycle take?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
It depends.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Some enterprises can run it in a few years,

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
others can maintain the stability stage for centuries,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
or stay at the decline stage for centuries.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Nevertheless, one way or another,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
the stage of the enterprise's development

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
greatly affects the stimulation system,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
the HR policy of the enterprise,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
and we have already talked about it a little.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
At the stage of adolescence,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
as a rule, there is no special control system

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
for stimulating labor,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and it is not particularly needed.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
A lot is kept simply on enthusiasm.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Then there is a need to bring stimulation

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
to a single, controlled system.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
For some time, the enterprise has been doing this,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
and often spends quite a lot of money on it.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
After that, the system starts to work,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
and, unfortunately, it is not always effective,

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
because the enterprise has already overcome

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
the previous stage of development,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
and the stimulation system is still focused on it,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
it does not have time to develop the enterprise.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But one way or another,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
it usually ends up at the stage of stagnation

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
and at the stage of reducing the efficiency of the enterprise,

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
if you want, at the stage of old age.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
The labor stimulation system

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
often meets not only the needs of the enterprise,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
but also the merits of its employees,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
the previous combat merits.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
And in this situation, it turns out

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
that not only the result is rewarded,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
not only the efficiency, but also the loyalty,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
so that everything is quiet,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
no one twitches, no one performs any feats.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
The system stimulates people more

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
to avoid mistakes than to achieve high results.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Thus, the management of the labor stimulation system

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
also implies that we realize

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
at what stage of development our enterprise is,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
we control the situation and understand

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
where this situation will develop further.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
We discussed external and internal factors

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
in relation to the organization,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
which must be taken into account

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
and which can and should be managed

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
if we want to create an effective labor stimulation system.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
I would like to dwell on several of them.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
The first is the corporate policy of the enterprise.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
From the point of view of labor stimulation,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
the corporate policy can be divided

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
into two opposite, but sometimes combined,

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
options.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
The first is the traditional policy of saving costs

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
and saving costs for the maintenance of staff.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
This means that we look at our employees

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
as if they were at a cost.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
And we want to make them spend less

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
and get more from them.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
And at the final stage of their development,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
such a policy turns into a shameless exploitation

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
of workers.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
The second is the opposite policy,

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
which is very popular now.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
It is the policy of investing in staff.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
When employees of an enterprise are not considered

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
as something that the enterprise

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
is forced to spend money on,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
but as human capital,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
in which funds are invested

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
in order to develop it.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
This policy sounds good,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
but it has its own limitations.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
We will see them now.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
The fact is that the policy can be different,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
but it must first of all respond to the situation

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
that has arisen in the economy,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
industry and labor market.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
Let's see how these objective factors

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
affect corporate policy

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Let's start with the policy of saving costs.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
This is an old system,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
which we try to recruit staff

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
at a cheaper price.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
And this can only be done

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
if the market is dominated by the employer.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
If the employer determines

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
what will happen in the market,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
who will be hired,

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
and how much to pay.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
And the employer is forced to agree

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
to the conditions offered by the employer

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
due to the deficit of jobs.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
This is a labor market

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
where money is expensive,

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
machinery is expensive,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
and employees are cheap.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
In this market,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
we do not pay much attention

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
to what is good or bad.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
What provides the quality of work?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
A simple selection.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
If there are many offers on the labor market,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
people are forced to compete

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
for jobs,

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
and if the worker does not work well,

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
it is easy to replace him.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
I will hire those who work well.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Is this possible?

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Yes, in a number of sectors.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
In a number of regions,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
this situation is preserved.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
It would be difficult to expect

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
a different behavior from the employer

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
if the conditions did not allow him to do this.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
What is the policy of investment?

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
This is a market where the worker decides

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
what will happen,

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
what conditions he will agree to.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
This means that the labor market

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
has a deficit of qualified workers,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
and the demand for labor resources

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
is much higher than the demand for jobs.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
This is a market where the worker decides

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
what conditions he will agree to.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
This means that the worker has a choice

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
and will think about what conditions he will agree to.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
In this situation,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
labor resources become expensive.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
They are more expensive than other resources.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Then the idea arises

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
that it is cheaper to create these resources

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
inside the enterprise,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
that is, to create a system

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
of internal labor market.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
What is this system?

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
It is a situation where we,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
when we need to replace a vacancy,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
first of all, pay attention

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
not to the external environment of the organization,

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
but to the internal one,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
that is, we look for a job among our own.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
This means that we need to train and develop our staff.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
We need to create a career ladder,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
a system of positional growth,

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
and we will train and develop them,

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
and they will look around,

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
find better conditions and leave us.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Now many employers complain about this.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
In this situation, competition for qualified staff,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
and in some cases,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
as we deal with production for staff in general,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
we need to change our perspective

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
on what staff is,

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
and how to consider the investment of our employees.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
The policy of investment in staff

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
is, first of all, investment in the development

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
and loyalty of the staff,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
and its attachment to itself.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Is it always justified?

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
Unfortunately, most enterprises cannot afford it,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
and the policy of investment in staff

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
requires significant costs,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
much higher than in the case of the policy of economy.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
In addition, it requires the possibility

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
of not only the development of the staff,

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
but also the creation of a sufficient number

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
and quality of jobs within the company.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
To this day,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
the vast majority of completed

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
and logical policies of investment in staff

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
are implemented by large transnational corporations.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
They can afford it,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
and it turns out that it is more profitable

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
and reliable for them to educate employees

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
in their own environment and invest money in them

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
than to look for people in the open labor markets

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
in all the countries where they work.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
But enterprises are not so big,

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
not so developed, not so rich,

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
and, unfortunately or fortunately,

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
they should be satisfied with less

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
and use a mixed policy,

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
where there are elements of economy and investment.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
The most important thing is that the organization

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
understands very well what policy it implements

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
and why.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Is it worth it to implement this policy

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
or is it too early?

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Maybe we will spend too much staff

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
and just go bankrupt,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
as in the anecdote I told at the beginning.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
The next thing that interests us is the labor market.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Let's dwell on it in more detail,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
because it is a rather delicate matter.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Let's move on to the most important factor

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
that determines the system of labor payment

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
at enterprises as the labor market.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
I would like to say a few words about the labor market.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
It differs from the usual markets

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
of goods and services

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
in that it is, in a sense,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
the market vice versa.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Who is a seller in the goods and services market?

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
The manufacturer is, in fact,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
a corporation, an organization, a company.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
What is sold and bought?

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Goods and services.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
And who is the buyer?

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
The buyer is a citizen who spends his money

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
to buy the goods and services he needs.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
What happens in the labor market?

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
To be precise, it is vice versa.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
What is sold in the labor market?

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Sometimes people say,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
that it is the labor resources,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
that people can provide to their employer.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
Who is a seller in the labor market?

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
The citizens.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
Who is the buyer of labor resources?

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Corporations and organizations.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Everything is put upside down.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
The fact that the labor market is the market vice versa

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
makes it more complex than the goods and services market.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
There are interesting collisions,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
which are determined by the fact that

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
if a seller is professional in the goods and services market,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
he has a marketing department,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
he tracks the market and understands what is going on in the market.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
Besides, he has a constant experience of sales,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
experience of production and implementation of his products.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
In the labor market, a seller is an unqualified person.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
After all, no one teaches anyone

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
how to sell their labor resources.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
How much should you ask for it?

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
What should you sell?

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Most people are not aware of this.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
It is not their fault, it is their problem.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
Although we have a lot of Internet resources,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
consultations, books on how to sell yourself.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Nevertheless, people do not know how to do it.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
They do not sell their labor resources very often.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
People do not look for a job every day or even every month.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Those who look for a job, do not find it.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Our employers do not like those who change jobs too often.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
So a person can change his job three, five, six times in his life.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
To what extent does he do it to qualified sellers?

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
It is very difficult to say.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Therefore, it often turns out that a person sells his resources

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
cheaper than he should.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
He may not even get into his own market segment.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
He may not value himself as he should value the labor market.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Let me give you an example.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
One of my acquaintances worked in the United States for many years.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
Then he returned to Russia.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
He is a very qualified economist.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
In the United States, he earned a lot of money.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
However, when he came back to his country,

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
it turned out that he was not very well-qualified.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
He was not young either.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
He started looking for a job in the range of $600-800.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
He could not find a job for six months.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Then he was advised to look for a job for $3,000.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
What do you think?

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
He found it very quickly.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
This is a phenomenon.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
A person valued himself low and was looking for a job

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
not in his own market segment.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
He came to a employer who needed an economist for $700.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
When the employer saw what a monster he was facing,

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
he realized that he was not the right person for the job.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
Those organizations that needed an economist for several thousand dollars

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
did not pay attention to the labor market segment

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
where there are $800 specialists.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
He found a job as soon as he raised his price three times.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Speaking of paradoxical examples,

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
the funniest one is from my personal experience.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
We hired a high-paid manager

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
and asked him about his claims on the level of the labor payment.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
He said that he did not care about the labor payment.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
He said that he agreed with the labor payment,

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
but that it was more than his wife's labor payment.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
He said that he did not care about the labor payment,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
but that it was more than his wife's labor payment.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Such phenomena happen quite often.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
They determine people's behavior.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
It turns out that a qualified buyer

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
should know what he is doing.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Who will do it?

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
You are absolutely right,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
the director of the staff.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
The seller is not qualified,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
but he is subject to difficult and incomprehensible causes.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Let's look at how the labor market works.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Let's understand how it works.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
It's very difficult to do it in two minutes.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Let's start with the first approximation.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Here are two pictures.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I suggest you not pay attention to the numbers.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
These are the data of 2006.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
They have become obsolete.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
We are not interested in the amount in dollars,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
but in the picture we see.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
What do we see here?

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
The first is a certain discrepancy in the labor market.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
If you draw a graph,

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
it will not be a straight line,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
but a set of columns with intervals.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
The intervals between the columns

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
are different for the director of the staff

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
and the inspector of the department of personnel.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
This is called a step in demand and supply.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Intervals between zones

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
where demand and supply are present.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
If we get to this interval,

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
we will not find anyone there.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
The second interesting point.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
Pay attention to the areas of unsatisfied demand.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
They are marked in red.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
Look.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
At high levels of the salary,

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
there is unsatisfied demand.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
This means that employers are ready to pay such money,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
but for some reason people are not ready to hire for such amounts.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
This completely refutes the idea

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
that people are trying to earn as much as possible.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
This is not true.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
A person on the labor market

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
evaluates himself in a certain way.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Often it turns out that the highest level of the salary

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
is not offered.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
This is due to the fact that

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
these positions have very high requirements.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Few people in the labor market

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
meet such requirements.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
It is extremely difficult to find people

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
for such positions on the open labor market.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Pay attention to the conflict zones.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
They are marked in red.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
Here we see that either the demand is sharply increasing,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
or the demand is sharply exceeding the demand.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
This means that in these zones

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
many employers would like to find employees,

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
but they are not ready to pay such a high salary.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Or vice versa.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Many employers would like to get these conditions,

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
but they are not ready to pay such a high salary.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
This is a very important point.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
If we look at this graph,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
we see that there are also equilibrium zones.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
These are zones where labor and capital

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
are roughly the same.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
The demand is approximately the same as the supply.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
It is easy to find employees in these zones.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
This is how the labor market works.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
It is clear that the demand is not high.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
The demand is high,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
but the demand is not high.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Without understanding this system,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
which is constantly changing,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
it can change for several quarters.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
Without understanding this system,

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
we will not be able to formulate a system of stimulation.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
We can easily get into a conflict zone.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
We can easily get into a zone of unsatisfied demand.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
If we want to pay too much,

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
we can find employees in the zones

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
that are not in the labor market.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
I would say that the marketing of the labor market

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
is the basis for the formation of a system

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
of payment of labor and stimulation of labor.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
The right person should do this.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
I urge you to study marketing.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
We will not go far without it.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
I would like to once again ask your attention

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
to the step of demand and supply.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
If we look at the graphs,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
we will see that in the lower layers of the market,

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
where the labor payment is not high,

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
this step is small.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
In the upper layers of the market,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
where the high-paid specialists

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and the amount is relatively large,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
the step will be large.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What is the difference?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We will talk about it later.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The next factor that determines

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
the system of stimulation of labor

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
is the opinion of the workers.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It turns out that this opinion

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
is a large circle of parameters.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Let's look at them in sequence.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
First of all, these are the needs of a person.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It is clear that in order to support himself,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
his family, his employees,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
a person must earn a certain amount.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But what amount?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It is determined by needs.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
How objective are these needs?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The needs of a person are the standard of living

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that he should, wants and can lead.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
For one, yachts, luxury villas,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Rolex watches for tens of thousands of dollars,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and for another, food and shelter.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
A lot depends on the social origin of a person,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
the social environment in which he lives,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
family traditions, and many other factors.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But the most important thing is

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
the idea of what kind of life he intends to lead.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
The second is investment in the future.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Investment in your own future

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
or investment in the future of your family.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
For a young person,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
investment in the future is a constant factor.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
In the past century,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
you could get an education

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and then spend the rest of your life on it.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Now, as we know,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
the management system, technology,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and everything else change so quickly

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
that you have to leave quickly.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Therefore, investment in your own future,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
investment in the cost of your labor,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
that is, education and development,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
is what a person should do

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
for almost the entire period of his labor biography.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
In the middle of this period,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
a new problem arises.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It is the investment in the future of your descendants, your children.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You have to pay for education.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And since most young people

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
are not able to pay for it after school age,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
a person should focus on making enough money

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
to invest in their descendants.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And finally, old age.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
A person should earn enough

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
to provide for a period of his life

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
when he will not be able to earn money.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The next important factor

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
that determines the opinion of workers

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
is justice.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
We have already touched on this factor.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It is quite complex.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
First of all, it is the idea of a worker

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
about how much he should earn

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
on the labor market with his education and experience.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
The ideas are very subjective.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Sometimes they correspond to reality,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
sometimes they do not correspond at all.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But if you meet people who have received a higher education,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
an additional MBA,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
and have three years of work experience,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
they can claim for such a salary

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
that our employer is not able to provide.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The next point related to the fairness of payment

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
is the idea of labor costs.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
How much a person is willing to invest in his work,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
how much he intends to give to his employer

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
in terms of his time, effort,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
labor costs, knowledge, skills, energy, etc.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
A very important factor in determining fairness

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
is comparing yourself to others.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
A person often bases his idea of fairness

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
on how much his acquaintances earn,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
his neighbors, his colleagues.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
He is inclined to pay

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
according to his level of work experience.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
He often thinks that if my neighbor,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
who is less qualified,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
is working every day,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
and earns more than me,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
then it is probably wrong

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
and I should be equal to him.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I repeat that this factor in comparison with others

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
is also quite subjective.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
It also determines the opinion of workers

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
about the compensation they agree to

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
for their work.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Of course, this is self-assessment and level of compulsion.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
A purely subjective factor

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is related to the idea of fairness

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and the idea of the needs,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
the level of life that a person would like to lead.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
A very important factor is the factor of recognition.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
This is a moral factor.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
It is extremely important for a person

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
to understand that he is not just a working horse,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that he does not just go to work to earn a living,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
but that he is a respected member of society.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
He is respected by society as a whole,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
by the management of his enterprise,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
by his employer, by his colleagues,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and finally by his friends.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I have seen examples of people

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
who go to work to reduce their work conditions

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
because of the increase in recognition,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
self-assessment and the status of this work in society.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
For many highly qualified specialists,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
the factor of self-assessment and recognition

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
is largely due to the fact that they do their work

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
well, remarkably, and magnificently.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
The factor of self-realization,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
recognition, high self-esteem,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and the ability to see and appreciate yourself

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
as a worthy specialist,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
who knows and can do what others cannot,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
who is able to achieve what others cannot achieve,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
is also an extremely important factor.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
In a significant way, especially at a young age,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
the behavior of workers in relation to work

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and compensation is determined by this.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
It is necessary to say a few words

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
about what a person considers

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
as a higher or lower payment of his work.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Here the principle of barely noticeable difference comes into play.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Please look at the graph.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Here we are dealing not with a straight line,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
but with a curve.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Imagine that you earn 5,000 rubles a month.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
How much do you need to pay as a bonus

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
or how much do you need to increase your salary

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
so that you can see that it is a significant increase or bonus?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Is 500 rubles enough for you?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Yes, it is.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And if you earn 100,000 rubles instead of 5,000 rubles,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
how much money do you need to increase your salary

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
so that you can see that it is a significant increase or bonus?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Is 50 rubles enough? No, it is not.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And how much do you need to pay for 500 rubles?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Not less than 1,500 rubles.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Please pay attention to the curve on this graph.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It is a curve, not a straight line.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
The more you earn, the greater the difference between your income and bonuses,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
or, on the contrary, a reduction in your salary,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
so that you can feel it.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
When developing effective systems for stimulating labor,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
you need to take into account this principle of barely noticeable difference.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
If we try to increase the salary of a worker,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
raise his rate, or pay him a bonus,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
so that he can feel it,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
this amount should be within the range of barely noticeable difference.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
How much does this noticeable difference make?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But practice shows that it is 10-15% of the salary of a worker.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Is it always like this?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No, it is still connected with national traditions.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
For example, in Japan,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
a person can receive a ridiculous amount of money as a bonus.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It is assumed that his work is fully rewarded by his salary,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
and the bonus is a moral boost.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It shows that he is well treated and highly respected.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If something similar happened in our country or in European culture,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I think that a worker would be very surprised.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Thus, dear colleagues,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
when forming a system for stimulating labor,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
when forming a bonus system,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
when deciding which workers are worthy of a raise and at what level,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
you must take into account the principle of barely noticeable difference.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Otherwise, you can make a mistake and lose your job.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
You can either make a mistake and lose your job,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
or you can offend people instead of showing their value to your organization.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
In conclusion, let's look at the structure of the company's costs for the maintenance of staff.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
We will look at the system of costs and investments,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
in accordance with the two policy frameworks we discussed earlier.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
One of the main problems of stimulating labor

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
for the employees of enterprises is that most of the costs

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
are naively attributed to labor costs.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
In fact, this is not true at all.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
If we calculate all the costs of the enterprise for maintaining its staff,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
the sum will be at least twice or even three times more

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
than the total labor cost.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Let's look at the main costs of the enterprise

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
for maintaining its labor resources.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
The first is the maintenance of workplaces.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
If we have a worker,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
he must have a table, a computer, a phone, a chair,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and a square meter of space, as per the sanitary standards.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It is clear that this pleasure is not so cheap.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
The second is compensation.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
The compensation package is offered to the worker.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
We will soon look at the components of this package.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
As we have already said, the costs can be very high.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
We will manage the rest of our activities.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The next issue is taxation.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I can assure you that taxation for maintaining staff

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
is a serious and solid part of the enterprise's duties.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The next issue is the renewal and replenishment of staff.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
If the organization is growing,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
we need new people to work.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
How can we get them?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Who will do it?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It will be your HR department.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
These people need a place to work,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
they need jobs,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
they need to pay for their work,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
but they also need to spend money on advertising,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
on the fees for the staff agencies,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
and on the replenishment of staff resources.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
For some enterprises, especially for the growing ones,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
this is a serious issue.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
The next issue is the costs for managing staff.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You are the HR director,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
you get your salary,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I hope it is high enough.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The department you manage

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
is also a cost for the enterprise

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
to pay for the staff.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The department also has a role

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
to manage the staff resources.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
The last issue is the corporate activities.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This is a big part of the social package.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The total cost is not small.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
All the costs are not only related to the salary.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
All the other costs are also important.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You need to consider their effectiveness.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
If you remember,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
the committee on the system of stimulation of labor

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
needs specialists, including financiers and accountants.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
The next thing we will talk about

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
is the investment in the staff.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
These investments can be divided into two categories.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
The first is the development and training of the staff.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
In order to develop the staff,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
we need to develop the career system.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
In order to keep the staff,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
the labor resource is more expensive than before,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
we need to develop the compensation system

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
to make it more attractive for the staff.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
This is an investment we invest in the labor resources

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
of our employees.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The second category is the development of the staff.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
The development of the staff is a part of the system.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
The third category is the development of the compensation system.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
This is an investment we invest in the labor resources of our employees.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Our employees are free citizens

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
who live in a democratic society,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
who obey the law,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
they have freedom of will and the right to choose.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
They can take the increase in the value of their resources

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
on the labor market and go to another place.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
We do not want this.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
A significant part of our costs for the development of the labor market

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
is the costs of maintaining the staff.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
We can invest in other areas

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
that will not go away.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
For example, the development of the quality of life at work.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Let's say that our employees went to the canteen

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
of a neighboring factory,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and now we have opened our own canteen.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We pay employees for food.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
This improves the working conditions.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
We can make a major renovation of the premises.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
We can install new furniture.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
We can install an aquarium with fish.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
We can create a room for relaxation

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
where beautiful music will sound.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We can hire a psychologist

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
who will relax our employees

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
between the stress they experience at work.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
We can invest in improving the working conditions

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
that will remain with us in our organization.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And finally,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
we can invest in the development of the management system.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We need a system that will be able to calculate better,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
that will allow us to better understand

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
what we spend our money on

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and what we get as a result.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
We need a system that will be more effective

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
in terms of time, labor costs,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
and the number of people involved in this system.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
All this will be an investment

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
in the development of our employees

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and the working conditions.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
The moral of the story is that

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
everything we have discussed so far

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
is a continuous system

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that should be developed at the enterprise as a whole.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
We know that one part of the system

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
cannot work better than the whole system.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
If we put the wheels of a new Mercedes

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
on an old worn out car,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
it will not drive better.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And as they say,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
the speed of a caravan

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
is equal to the speed of the slowest camel.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Therefore, when we will be working

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
on the payment system of labor

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
at the enterprise,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
on the stimulation system,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I urge you to pay attention

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
not only to this system,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
but also to the whole system of costs and investments

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
that we have just discussed.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Because, once again,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
one component of the system cannot develop and work better than the whole system.
