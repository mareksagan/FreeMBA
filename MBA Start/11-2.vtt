00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Today's video is about functional marketing strategies.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
The lecture consists of three parts.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
In the first part, we will first look at the relationship between the corporate strategy and the company,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
the marketing strategy and the main functional marketing strategies.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Then we will look at the main features and algorithms for forming functional marketing strategies.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
In the second part, we will look at the features of the formation of functional marketing strategies

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
in the case when the company operates in the business-to-business market,

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
that is, when our client is a company.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
In the third part, we will look at the features of the formation of functional marketing strategies in the service sector.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
The main goal of this video lecture is to teach you how to make marketing decisions

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
regarding functional marketing strategies,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
including in the case when the company operates in the business-to-business market or in the service sector.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's move on to the first section.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
First, let's look at the relationship between the corporate strategy and the company,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
the marketing strategy and the functional marketing strategies.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Pay attention to the slide.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
In the slide, you can see that the marketing strategy of the company is based on the corporate strategy.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
The marketing strategy, in turn, has such a fundamental element as the positioning strategy,

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
which involves placing the company, its goods or brands in the consciousness of the buyer in a certain place

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
or a certain position relative to the competitors.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
Next, the branding strategy is based on the positioning strategy.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Below, you can see that the branding strategy, in turn, involves the formation of functional strategies,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
such as distribution strategies, communication strategies, product and price strategies.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Please note that the types of functional marketing strategies correspond to the elements of the marketing mix,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
that is, 4P â€“ goods, product promotion, goods price and distribution.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Let's move on to the branding strategy.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The branding strategy is a long-term plan for the use of the brand within the framework of the company's marketing strategy.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
The branding strategy defines the focus and direction of the company's brand management

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
and represents a set of strategic brand solutions.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
The algorithm for the brand formation is as follows.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
First, the market segmentation is carried out.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
We select the segment of buyers for whom we will offer goods under our brand.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Then we form the so-called brand identity.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
What is the brand identity?

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
First of all, it is its difference from the brands of competitors.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
The difference of the brand should be formulated in terms of advantages.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Then we position our brand,

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
that is, we place it in a certain place in the consumer's consciousness regarding the brands of competitors.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Also, an integral part of the brand identity is its so-called attributes.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
The brand attributes are, first of all, the characteristics of the product that we sell under a certain brand,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
the characteristics of the marketing communication associated with this brand,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
and the formal characteristics of the brand.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Under the formal characteristics of the brand, the brand name,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
the brand colors and other formal characteristics are understood,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
including the musical accompaniment, which is typical of the advertising messages about this brand.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Let's consider the main types of branding strategies.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Pay attention to the slide.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Here you see a diagram, where the main opportunities for the formation of a branding strategy are shown.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
At a certain point, the company can decide to change something in its branding management.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And quite often, a decision is made to expand the boundaries of the brand's use.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Pay attention to the slide.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
Here you see what types of branding strategies can be used to expand the boundaries of the brand's use.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
The first type of branding strategy for expanding the boundaries of the brand's use

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
is the use of the brand within one product category.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Let's consider the first option.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
It is the extension of the product line.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
What does it mean?

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
Most often, the extension of the product line means that we add a new product to the assortment,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
which has a new taste or a new packaging size.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
You can see an example on the slide, how the juice manufacturer Fruit Garden added a new taste to its assortment.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
This is an example of the extension of the product line.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
The extension of the product line can be done not only by changing the taste,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
adding a new taste to the product,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
but also by changing the packaging size or the type of packaging of the product.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
What are the advantages of this strategy?

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
First of all, by adding a new type of product to the assortment,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
the company increases the number of customers,

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
which means that the number of people whose preferences can be satisfied with the product under our brand.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
In addition, having a large number of modifications of the product,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
the company can increase the share of the shelf.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
The next option is the vertical extension of the brand's boundaries.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Pay attention to the example on the slide.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
The vertical extension of the brand's boundaries can occur both up and down.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
If we extend the boundaries of the brand up,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
it means that we offer a new product under our brand,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
which has a higher price and greater advantages.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
In this case, you can see how the company Kimberly Clark,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
the manufacturer of the Huggies diapers,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
offered a new product under the Huggies diapers,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
under the Huggies Supreme brand.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
This product has a higher quality and a higher price,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
and is designed for a different target segment of the customer.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
In the case of the vertical extension of the brand's boundaries,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
the company usually adds the so-called descriptors to the brand.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
This is a word that is added to the main brand itself,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
and explains to the customer that this product is of a higher quality and belongs to the premium segment.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Here you can see that the Supreme descriptor is added to the Huggies brand.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Other descriptors can be added,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
explaining that the product has a higher price and higher quality.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
For example, gold, premium, platinum,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
and other similar descriptors that you have probably encountered.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
If the company extends the boundaries of the brand down,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
it means that the company includes its product under the same brand,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
but which has a lower quality or is more simplified,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
that is, it has simpler characteristics and is offered at a lower price.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
In our example, you can see how the manufacturer of the Huggies diapers offers the buyer a cheaper version of the Huggies Classic.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
These products are sold at a lower price and have simpler characteristics,

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
designed for the high-price segment.

07:29.000 --> 07:38.000
In these cases, the descriptors are usually such words as Econome, Economy, or Classic.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
But not all companies implement the strategy of expanding the boundaries of the brand up or down.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
In some cases, the company comes to the conclusion that this is unacceptable.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Let's look at the following examples.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Unilever, the manufacturer of Lipton tea, decided to offer tea for the buyer's segment with a higher price sensitivity.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
But it decided that using the same brand for this segment was unacceptable.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
Therefore, the company used a multi-brand approach and offered a new brand for the low-price segment.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
You can see on the slide this is the BeSeda brand.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
When Toyota decided to offer a product for the high-price segment,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
it also decided to abandon the strategy of expanding the boundaries of the brand.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
A new brand was created.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You can see the photo.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
This is the well-known Lexus brand.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
The next strategy is to expand the boundaries of the trademark to other product categories.

08:36.000 --> 08:44.000
One of the most famous examples of a company using its brand for a large number of product categories is Disney.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Disney trademark is used for a large number of products.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
This includes children's clothing, toys, food, and even MP3 players.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
But not all cases of expanding the boundaries of the brand to other product categories can be successful.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
There are cases when a certain brand is not associated with a certain product category.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Let's take the following example.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
When Samsung decided to produce a car, it turned out that this was not the right decision.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Because the buyer cannot imagine buying a car under the brand name Samsung.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
The next trademark strategy is a joint branding.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
This is a situation when two companies promote their brands at the same time.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
What are the advantages of this strategy?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
First of all, the advantage of the economic scale.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Because when two brands promote at the same time, the company saves money.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
But there is a problem.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
There can be disagreements between companies when promoting.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
If companies have different goals, they may not reach a compromise in promoting their brands.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
One of the most popular examples is a joint branding of brands such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
What are the advantages and disadvantages of other strategies?

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
The strategy of extending the product line has the advantage that companies get more customers.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
But at the same time, the company's costs increase.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And there is a risk of so-called commodity cannibalism.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
When buyers start to buy a new product, but at the same time refuse to buy the old one.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
The main disadvantage of vertical branding is the image of the company and its brand.

10:39.000 --> 10:49.000
Consumers begin to doubt the quality of the offered goods, even if it is a product that is sold at a higher price.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
When the brand's borders are extended, the following problem may occur.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
The fact is that not all new products, even if they are sold at a higher price,

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
and have a premium descriptor, will be perceived by buyers as a product of higher quality.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Because the main brand, which is in the middle price category,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
will reduce the image and will not allow buyers to assume that the product,

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
even if it has a prestigious descriptor, is of a high price segment and has the appropriate quality.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
There are situations when a company needs to make radical decisions about its brand.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
When it is impossible to continue the business as before.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
In this case, the so-called brand recovery occurs.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
The brand recovery can be carried out in several ways.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
The first way is the so-called brand reanimation.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
The brand reanimation can be carried out in several directions.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
First, we can offer a product under our brand to other segment of buyers.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Or we can offer a new area of application of our brand.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
An example here is the Johnson & Johnson company,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
which decided at a certain stage of its development to offer Baby Oil not only for use in care for children,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
but also for use by adults.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
This is a typical example of brand reanimation.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Also, a company can stimulate the intensity of consumption of a product under a certain brand.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
In addition to brand reanimation, a company can carry out a strategy of consolidation of brands.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
In this case, a company introduces a new brand to the market.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
But what to do with an old brand?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
There are several possible solutions.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
The first option is a gradual overthrow of the old brand.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
When a company offers two brands, both new and old,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
but the old one gradually leaves the market.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
The second option is when the old brand is instantly removed from the market

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
and it is assumed that it no longer exists.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And the third option is so-called internal co-branding,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
when a company uses two brands at the same time.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
When a company really faces big problems in its management of trading brands,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
it is necessary to make a decision about brand repositioning.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
How can repositioning take place?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
First, a company needs to change the perception of its brand.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
It can be both real and psychological repositioning.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
What does real repositioning mean?

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
In this case, a company usually changes something in its product to improve its quality, for example.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And the buyer really begins to perceive the product in a different way,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and its repositioning changes.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
There is also psychological repositioning.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
First of all, this is due to the fact that the product is perceived by the buyer in a wrong way.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
For example, it happens that the buyer is not sufficiently aware of the product

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
and, let's say, considers it expensive, although in fact this product is available to the buyer.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
In this case, psychological repositioning occurs.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
That is, the company announces to the client that the product is actually available

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
and emphasizes this in its advertising messages.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
If repositioning is not enough, the company does rebranding,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
that is, a drastic change of the image.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
In this case, not only the positioning of the brand, but also its ideology changes,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
and the formal attributes of the brand also change.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Now let's move on to the consideration of the company's product strategy.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
One of the main elements of the product strategy is the strategy of developing new products.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
What are new products?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
There are several types of new products.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
First of all, these are the so-called world's new products,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
that is, really new products that never existed and that no one has ever offered.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
The second option is new product lines.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
In this case, a new product is actually new only for the company itself,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
but these products already exist on the market, but they are offered by other companies.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
The third option of a new product is the expansion of existing product lines,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
when within a certain product category, which is no longer new for the company,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
new modifications are offered.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
The next type of new product is when the improvement of existing products in the company occurs.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
The difference from the expansion of existing product lines is that

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
in the case of expansion of existing product lines,

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
a new product assumes that the old product will also remain in the assortment

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
and there will be buyers who prefer the old product.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
In the case of improvement, it is assumed that a new improved product will completely replace the old one.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
The next option of a new product is a repositioning product,

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
that is, in fact, it is the same product of the company, only positioned differently.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
Another option of a new product is a situation when the company offers a product at a reduced price.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
This means that a product, perhaps more simplified, is produced with less costs

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
and is offered to a wider circle of buyers, because it has a lower price.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Only 10% of new products are actually world-class novelties.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
The remaining 90% of new products are either new products for companies,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
that is, new product lines, or an expansion of existing product lines, or an improvement.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
There are companies that specialize in the production of world-class novelties.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
These are the well-known companies 3M, Microsoft, Sony and others.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
But not all new products are accepted by the market.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
According to statistics, 95% of new products are unsuccessful.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
What are the reasons for the failure of new products?

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
First, there are often situations when a new product is not needed by the consumer

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
and is a favorite idea or a dream of the company owner or top manager.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
Therefore, this idea is promoted and the product begins to be developed and produced.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
The next reason for failure is market overestimation,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
when marketers have not studied the demand and needs of buyers enough.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
As a result, a new product is not needed by the buyer or they are not ready to buy it at the proposed price.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Another reason for failure is a wrong communication strategy,

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
when buyers are simply not aware of the appearance of a new product.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Let's look at the algorithm of the development of a new product.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
The first stage of the algorithm is the formation of ideas.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
How do ideas for new products form?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
First, people can be the source of ideas.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
First, the company itself and its employees,

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
who can identify some imperfections or assume that the change in the product will please the buyer.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
But, of course, the main source of the idea of â€‹â€‹new products is the buyer.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
The company must establish a system of obtaining information from the buyer

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
about what changes they would like to make in the product and what are the features of their preferences,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
to offer the buyer exactly what they really need.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
In addition to obtaining information about new products from employees or customers of the company,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
there are a number of methods that allow developers to propose new ideas.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
These methods are briefly discussed in the lecture.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
The next stage of the development of a new product is the selection of ideas.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
The selection of ideas is a very important stage.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The selection of ideas is carried out according to the following principles.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
First, it is checked whether there are really needs that need to be satisfied with this product.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Second, it is checked whether it is possible to produce a product with such costs

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
and set such a price on it so that it corresponds to the quality of the product and is acceptable to the buyer.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
In addition, it is necessary to consider whether the company has production experience for the production of such a product.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
In addition, it is necessary to consider the estimated volume of sales

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
in order to understand whether it is reasonable to produce this product.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
When selecting ideas, the company can make a mistake.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Mistakes when selecting ideas are divided into two groups.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
A type of yes means that the company accepts the idea as good,

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
but it is not really reasonable.

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
A type of no means that the company rejects the idea and the product is not sold.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
The next stage of the development of a new product is the development of the concept of the product.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
The development of the concept involves answering three basic questions.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
What, who and how?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
What does it mean? How will the product look like?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
What characteristics will it have?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
What will it represent?

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
The answer to the question who assumes who will purchase and use this product,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
what will the consumers buy this product for,

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
and the question how assumes how the product will be used and how it will satisfy the needs of the buyer.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
It is extremely necessary for the company to analyze the opportunities of the production of a new product and its sale.

20:10.000 --> 20:17.000
This is determined by the estimated volume of sales, the estimated cost and the estimated profit of the company.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
Finally, one of the last stages is the testing of the new product.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
There can be two types of testing of the new product.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
The so-called alpha testing and beta testing.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
The alpha testing assumes that the product is tested by the company employees.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
The beta testing assumes that the product is offered for testing by the real buyer.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
The next element of the product strategy is the assortment strategy.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
As part of the assortment strategy, it is necessary to make decisions on the following elements.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
First, the width of the assortment.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
How many product categories will the company produce?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Second, the depth of the assortment.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
How many modifications or variants of the product will the company offer within each product category?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Then, the decision on the increase of the assortment.

21:09.000 --> 21:17.000
Will the company offer products at a higher price and higher quality or at a lower price and higher quality,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
compared to the frames that it uses now?

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
The assortment saturation assumes that the company adds new products to its assortment,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
but in the price frames that are already used.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
That is, there is no increase in the assortment, neither up nor down.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Now let's move on to the price strategy.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
The price strategy is closely related to the concept of price positioning.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
What is price positioning?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Pay attention to the slide.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Here you see the so-called value map.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
The value map is a model used to carry out the company's price positioning.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
You see that on one axis we have the perceived price of the product.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Here we should consider the perceived price, not the actual price of the product.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Pay attention to this.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
On the other axis we have the perceived quality of the product.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
Again, we should evaluate the quality of our product and compare it with the quality of the competitor's product

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
not by some formal signs, but by the perception of the buyer.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
You see that the so-called VAL line is represented on the graph.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
This is the line of all points that assume that the goods located on it

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
have an adequate or equivalent ratio of the perceived price and perceived quality.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
How can goods be positioned on the value map?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Look at the slide.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The first option.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
You see that goods A, B and C are located on the line of the equivalent value.

23:00.000 --> 23:09.000
This situation is called ideal and exists only when the buyers are aware of all offers on the market.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
In this case, you see that the company offers several goods in different price categories.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Cheaper goods have lower quality,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
more expensive goods have higher perceived quality.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
But the ideal situation is not always real.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Sometimes the buyers are not aware of the goods,

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
do not adequately evaluate their quality or do not know what goods are available on the market.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
In this case, it is possible to position the company not on the line of the equivalent value, but beyond it.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
You can see that goods C is located above the VAL line.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
This means that the perceived price of this product is higher than its perceived quality,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
that is, it does not correspond to the perceived price.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
This position is not very convenient for the company,

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
because in this case it is more profitable for the buyer to buy goods D,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
because it has a higher perceived quality.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
You can also see that goods B is located below the line of the equivalent value.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
This means that its perceived quality is higher than its perceived price,

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
that is, it is the most profitable offer for the buyer.

24:28.000 --> 24:35.000
If the company plans to position its goods on the market, there are several strategies.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Pay attention to the slide.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
You can see that in this case the goods of the company, new goods,

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
are positioned on the line of the equivalent value in the mid-price segment.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
In this case, the goods occupy a free niche,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
and competitors should not react aggressively to this action.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
The second option is to position new goods in the already occupied segment.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
In this case, it is possible that the competitors will react unpredictably.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
The third option is when the company positions its goods in a higher price segment,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
in an unoccupied place.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
In this case, there is the following danger.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Perhaps this niche is not yet occupied,

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
because there is no group of buyers who are ready to purchase this product at such a high price.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Despite the higher offered quality.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
And the fourth option is when a new product is positioned below the line of the equivalent value.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
In this case, its perceived quality is higher than its perceived price.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
This situation is very profitable for the company,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
but it can have predictable consequences.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
The consequences can be as far as the line of the equivalent value is displaced.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
That is, buyers will no longer perceive the price-quality ratio as adequate and old,

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
and will consider that all companies must offer higher quality at a lower price.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Now let's move on to price strategies,

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
each of which corresponds to a certain price positioning.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
You can see the same price map on the slide, but in a slightly different representation.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Here you see that the price map is divided into 4 segments.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Each of these segments corresponds to a certain price strategy.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
The first option is the so-called economic price strategy,

26:41.000 --> 26:48.000
when the company offers a fairly low perceived quality at a fairly low price.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
When the company offers a product of a high perceived quality at a high price,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
this strategy is called a premium.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
There are two more options for price strategies.

27:00.000 --> 27:09.000
One of the strategies assumes that the company offers a product of medium or low perceived quality at a fairly high price.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
In this case, the perceived price does not correspond to the perceived quality of the product.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
This strategy is called a premium.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
In what cases can this price strategy be used?

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
First, to use this strategy, it is necessary that there are buyers on the market

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
who are ready to purchase a product at such a high price.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Secondly, this product must have a certain novelty,

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
which would attract innovator buyers and make them pay a higher price.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
In addition, the company must understand that its product can be copied by competitors

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and they can offer it at a lower price.

27:46.000 --> 27:56.000
Therefore, only those products that are difficult to copy or that the competitors will spend a sufficient period of time on copying are suitable for the strategy of removing the plums.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
Another price strategy is the so-called penetration strategy on the market.

28:01.000 --> 28:11.000
The penetration strategy assumes that the company offers a product of high or medium quality at a fundamentally low price.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
In this case, the product is positioned below the equivalent value line.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
In what cases can this strategy be used?

28:20.000 --> 28:29.000
First, this strategy is suitable for situations when there are a sufficient number of buyers of the perceived price on the market.

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
In addition, this strategy is suitable for situations when the company can save on a large scale.

28:36.000 --> 28:42.000
And it is also extremely necessary that the low price for the product does not cause buyers doubts in its quality

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
and they do not refuse to purchase the product.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Now let's look at the types of price strategies in terms of price standardization.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Here, the company can use two main types of strategies.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
The first option is the single price strategy.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
In this case, the company offers all its customers the same prices for a certain product.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.000
The second option is the so-called price discrimination or differentiated pricing,

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
when the company offers its product to different groups of buyers at different prices.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
The main problem in the framework of price discrimination is the construction of so-called barriers,

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
that is, the creation of differences between the products that we sell to different groups of buyers at different prices.

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
These differences can be both real and perceived, that is, they can have an exclusively subjective nature.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
Now let's look at what price strategies can be used by the market leaders.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
The market leader can use the so-called market pressure strategy.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
In this case, the leader sets low prices for his product,

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
and it turns out that competitors can no longer set prices higher,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
and they are forced to keep their prices at a lower level.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
In this case, the leader can actually survive from the market of all his competitors,

30:01.000 --> 30:08.000
if they have higher costs and cannot afford to implement products at low prices.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
The next option is opportunistic pricing,

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
when the market leader, on the contrary, sets the highest prices for his products.

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
Now let's look at what price strategies can be used not by manufacturers, but by trading companies.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
There are two most interesting types of price strategies for retail companies.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
These are the so-called low price strategy every day and high and low price formation.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
What does this strategy suggest?

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
The low price strategy every day suggests that a retail company offers its products to buyers

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
at prices that are, on the one hand, lower than the average market price,

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
but on the other hand, they are higher than the retail price, that is, as low as possible.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
In fact, it would be more correct to call this strategy the low price strategy.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
What are the advantages of the low price strategy every day?

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
First, the stable low prices create a sense of fairness for the buyer,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
and, as a rule, these companies have a positive image.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
In addition, the company does not create a problem of delayed purchases.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
In the case when a buyer constantly expects a sale,

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
he often postpones his purchases and does not buy the product at the proposed higher price today.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
In this case, when the buyer does not need to wait for anything,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
and because the company does not use the practice of sales,

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
the buyer does not postpone his purchases, and this does not create a problem of demand fluctuations for the company.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
In addition, the advantage of this strategy is the reduction of advertising costs.

31:48.000 --> 31:56.000
Companies that constantly hold sales are forced to inform their buyers about the fact of holding a sale,

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
and this advertising costs a fairly large budget.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
In this case, this is not necessary.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
In addition, there is a version that companies that use the low price strategy every day offer a higher level of service.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
What is the reason for this?

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
When companies use sales, it happens that at a certain point in time there are a large number of people in the store.

32:20.000 --> 32:27.000
Accordingly, this does not allow the staff to provide a high enough level of service to all incoming buyers.

32:27.000 --> 32:33.000
In addition, a large number of people is not always pleasant for incoming customers.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
When using the low price strategy every day, such phenomena usually do not occur.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
Now let's look at the strategy called high and low price education.

32:45.000 --> 32:53.000
High and low price education implies that a retail company uses both high and low prices.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
This means that on a permanent basis, buyers are offered higher prices,

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
but sales are held periodically when goods are offered at the lowest possible price.

33:04.000 --> 33:11.000
And this price is usually lower than the price in companies that use the low price strategy every day.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
What are the positive features of this strategy?

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
First, the advantage here is that the company covers several segments of buyers.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
On the one hand, it attracts those buyers who believe that it is necessary to buy goods at higher prices,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
expecting them to be of higher quality.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
On the other hand, the company attracts those buyers who are most sensitive to prices

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
and would like to purchase goods as cheaply as possible.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
There is also a version that the very atmosphere of the sale attracts buyers.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
And in addition to those goods that are sold at the moment at a low price,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
buyers also purchase other goods at higher prices,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
which, in general, increases the volume of sales and profits of the company.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
But, as we have already said, the strategy of high and low prices implies that

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
during the sale period, the level of services in the company usually decreases.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Positioning is a very subjective aspect,

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
and the company should not always change some real characteristics,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
objective in its proposal, to change its positioning.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
How can you manage the positioning of your brand or product?

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
First, the company can change the perceived price level.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
How can this happen?

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
The fact is that buyers do not really know the price well,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
and if you tell them that this price is low, they will most likely believe you.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
What tactics do companies use in these cases?

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
How can companies manage the perception of price levels?

34:41.000 --> 34:47.000
First, it is established that buyers do not really know the prices of different goods.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
On average, the number of goods of a certain category,

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
the prices at which the buyer knows quite accurately, is 3.5 goods.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
This is statistics, so we get 3.5.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
And in order to manage the perception of the price level,

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
the company can tell the buyer whether this price is medium, high or low.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
This often happens when the company offers the buyer to compare this low price with another, higher one.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
As a rule, the comparison occurs either with the previous price of the product,

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
which was higher, or with the price of the competitor's product, or with the average price in the city.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Also, the company uses such a tool, which is called top-down pricing.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
In this case, in the trading room, the goods are located in the order of decreasing price.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
When the buyer enters the store, he first sees the most expensive goods of a certain category.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
And only by moving further, he gradually finds more and more cheap options.

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
In this case, the buyer gets the impression that the average price, or the adequate price,

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
is higher for this product, than if he first saw a cheaper product, and only then a more expensive one.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Now let's move on to the consideration of the company's communication strategy.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Let's consider the algorithm of communication strategy formation.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
First of all, the company must formulate the goals of communication with the buyers.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
The goals must be formulated quantitatively.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
For example, the goal of communication can be to increase awareness of a certain product

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
by a certain percentage among a certain group of buyers.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
What does creative strategy mean?

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Creative strategy involves two elements.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
First, it is the concept of communication itself,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
what message the company wants to convey to the buyer,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
that is, what is the main meaning of this message.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
The second element of creative strategy is the creation of a direct message

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
with all the graphic elements, illustrations, with which it will be presented to the buyer.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
One of the most complex elements of the algorithm of communication strategy formation

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
is the formation of the budget of communication.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
What are the methods of budget formation?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
One of the most common methods of budget formation of communication

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
is the method of percentage from a certain base.

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
The base can be used for both the company's revenue and marketing expenses.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
That is, the budget of communication is calculated as a percentage

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
from all the expenses for marketing or from the company's revenue.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
As a rule, there are certain standards in certain industries,

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
how much the average company in this industry spends on communication with buyers.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
In some cases, the budget of communication can reach 50% of the revenue.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
The next method of budgeting of communication strategy

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
is the so-called competitive parity or comparison with competitors.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
In this case, the company is focused on the expenses of competitors

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
and sets its budget at approximately the same level.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
Or, if the company uses less or more budget than its competitors,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
this decision must be justified.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
The next method is the method of fixed amount,

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
when the company, as a rule, expertly decides that the budget will have a certain amount,

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
but this method is not optimal and is used less and less.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Also, one of the common methods of budget formation of communication

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
is the goal and task method.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
In this case, the company tries to determine how much it needs to spend

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
in order to reach the set price.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
For example, how much it needs to spend on advertising

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
in order to reach the level of the buyer's awareness.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
The so-called marginal method is also used.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
The marginal method uses the following pattern.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
It is established that each additional ruble invested in communication

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
gives less and less effect.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
The company tracks how much more profit the company brings

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
from each ruble invested in communication than from the investment.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
At the moment when the company realizes that further investment in communication is not profitable,

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
the investment ends for a certain period.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Thus, the budget is formed for a certain period.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Next, you can see how the communication channels are selected.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
The selection of communication channels with buyers depends on a number of factors.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
You can see a table on the slide, where the main factors are presented,

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
which must be taken into account when choosing communication channels.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
For example, we must take into account the price category of our product.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
It is quite obvious that for products of a higher price category

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
it is unacceptable to use the same communication channels

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
as for products of the lowest price category.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
One of the last stages of the communication strategy is the assessment of its effectiveness.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
The assessment of communication effectiveness is carried out in several directions.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
First, we analyze what results we have achieved from the market point of view,

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
what share of the target buyers is covered by our communication message.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Then we analyze what results we have achieved from the point of view of the buyer's motives,

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
whether the buyer's motives have changed after communicating with them.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
We also analyze the effectiveness of the message itself,

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
whether the message is correct from the point of view of the fact that it is correctly understood by the buyers.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
We also assess the effectiveness of the communication channels.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
During the communication with the buyer, each company must track

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
which channels allow to attract the maximum number of new customers.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
And, of course, the company evaluates the economic effect of the entire communication strategy,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
namely, the profitability of communication.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
In this case, it is estimated what additional profit

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
the company managed to get for every ruble invested in communication with the buyers.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
Now let's look at the domestic strategy.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
On the slide you can see the domestic strategy formation algorithm.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
The company can form a domestic strategy for different purposes.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
This can be the introduction to the new product market

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
or the introduction to the existing product market.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
The company can also make changes to its domestic strategy when changing the environment.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
One of the important stages in the formation of a domestic strategy

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
is the decision whether the company will use the direct distribution channel or not.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
The direct distribution channel means that the company sells goods to the buyers directly,

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
that is, the company does not use the direct distribution channel.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
The indirect distribution channel means that the company uses the direct distribution channel

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
to distribute its goods to the intermediaries.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
In what cases is the indirect distribution channel used?

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
In order for the company to be able to use the indirect distribution channels most effectively,

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
the goods must be simple enough and not be distributed in a direct way.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
The indirect distribution channels are also used in situations

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
when the buyers are geographically disorganized.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
After the company has decided to use the indirect distribution channel

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
and select the intermediaries,

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
it is necessary to decide which marketing functions will be transferred to the intermediary.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
The intermediary can perform marketing functions such as

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
maintaining the stock of goods,

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
promoting the goods,

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
taking on credit risks, and also repair and warranty service.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
In each case, it is necessary to decide how much the intermediaries will be used.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
In each case, there are advantages.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
There is a tendency that large intermediaries serve the buyers worse.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
Small intermediaries, in turn, have such disadvantages

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
that they cannot maintain large stock of goods due to their limitations.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
The company must also decide which assortment will be implemented through each group of intermediaries.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
There are different options.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
There are cases when the company distributes the same assortment of goods through all intermediaries.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
There are other cases when each intermediary is used to distribute a certain type of goods.

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
That is, the intermediaries do not intersect in the sale of certain goods.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
After the company has decided what the distribution channel structure will be,

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
and which intermediaries it will use,

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
it is necessary to select specific companies that will perform the function of intermediaries.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
There are quite a few criteria that must be taken into account when choosing an intermediary.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
On the slide, you can see what characteristics a promising intermediary should have.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
After the company starts working with intermediaries,

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
it is necessary to regularly evaluate their performance.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
There is a quantitative methodology for evaluating the performance of intermediaries.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
To use it, the company must select a number of parameters

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
according to which the efficiency of the intermediary's performance will be evaluated.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
In this case, the parameters such as the volume of sales,

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
the average level of stock, the work of the staff, and so on, are selected.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
Each parameter is assigned a certain weight, depending on the specific situation that the company is in.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
After that, each intermediary is evaluated on a 10-point scale according to each criterion.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
After that, a weighted assessment of each intermediary is calculated.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
What problems can arise in the company when using indirect distribution channels?

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
First, a significant problem is that when using a direct distribution channel,

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
the company loses the point of contact with the client.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
That is, the company does not see its end customers directly.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
Thus, the speed of information transmission from the end customer to the company

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
is slowed down or the information may not reach the end customer at all.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
Therefore, the company must independently establish interaction with the customers

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
to receive information and feedback on its products or services.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
There are situations when the company loses information about the end seller of its products.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
That is, the company does not know who is the last participant of the distribution channel

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
and who directly sells the goods to the end customer.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
It is necessary to motivate intermediaries correctly.

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
A common situation is to motivate intermediaries using the so-called wick and gingerbread method.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
This is a situation when the company provides intermediaries with certain advantages

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
if they meet the requirements and, on the contrary,

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
the company provides intermediaries with certain advantages if the requirements are violated.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
But this approach can be effective only in the short-term.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
According to modern ideas, each company needs to establish long-term partnership relations with its intermediaries

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
and this will allow optimizing the company's everyday activities.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
The effectiveness of the everyday strategy is assessed by the following parameters.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
The first one is the support of the sales and market share goals.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
The second one is the support of the stock of goods.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
The third one is the assurance that each intermediary has the goods in stock all the time.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
The fourth one is the quality of the work with intermediaries.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
Now we move on to the next section and look at the features of the marketing strategy

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
that the business-to-business market has.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
This is when our clients are not private individuals but companies.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
The next feature of the business-to-business market is that

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
the demand for industrial goods or services is production.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
This means that the demand for industrial goods depends on the demand for those goods

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
that are produced using these goods or services.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
In addition, the important feature of the B2B market is that there are fewer buyers.

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
This means that each buyer, each client is more valuable to the company

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
and the loss of even one client can significantly affect the volume of sales and the volume of the profit.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
Another important feature is that the clients in the industrial market are usually professionals.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
They have a large knowledge of the goods that are purchased

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
and do not use prices as a quality indicator because they have a high level of qualification.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
Another feature is that the distribution channels in the industrial market are usually shorter.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
It is also necessary to consider that when buying goods or services in the industrial market,

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
the buyer takes a greater risk.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
What does this mean?

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
If a business buyer buys a low-quality product or receives low-quality services,

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
this can significantly affect its production process,

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
as well as stop production and the company will lose a large amount of profit.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
This does not happen in the consumer market.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
The salesman is also largely dependent on the buyer.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
Each buyer is really important to the seller.

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
Another feature of the industry market is that a group of buyers decides on the sales.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
The group of industrial buyers is usually called the procurement committee.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
The procurement committees in different companies can have different forms.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
This can be a group of procurement employees and a group of inter-functional procurement employees.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
In the procurement committee, various employees have different roles.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
These roles are highlighted as users,

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
buyers and buyers,

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
and the buyers filter the information received about the goods or services.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
Users are those employees who will use the goods or services.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
They formulate their needs.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
The decision-making person is usually highly qualified and has good knowledge of the product.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
They select the goods and decide what characteristics they should have.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
The concept of marketing relationships arose in the B2B market.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
Marketing relationships means that a long-term interaction between a client and a company is established.

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
This interaction is not limited to a single transaction.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
In marketing relationships, the first priority is the quality of the goods and services.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
The price is secondary.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
In order to effectively implement marketing relationships,

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
a company must have a good reputation and support it.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
The role of internal marketing in the industrial market cannot be overestimated.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
Since direct distribution channels are most often used in the industrial market,

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
direct contact between buyers is carried out with the help of household staff.

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
Sales managers or householders must provide the client with the necessary information about the company.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
They must understand the company's ultimate goal, its mission and the essence of the marketing strategy.

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
You can see the type of decision-making in the slide.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
Pay attention to the fact that the most interesting for us is the purchase of new tasks.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
When buying again, the decision-making algorithm is usually reduced.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
Now let's see what are the differences between the decision-making algorithm in the industrial market and the one in the industrial market.

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
Here you can see that there are more stages.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
In the industrial market, the search for information is more lengthy.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
The maximum amount of information about the alternatives is collected,

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
which is usually not the case in the consumer market.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
Often, the buyer makes a purchase without having any information about the alternatives.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
Also, the alternative assessment is carried out in more detail.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
Almost all characteristics of the offered goods or services are taken into account.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
Let's see what factors of the alternative assessment are used in the B2B market.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
In the slide, you can see a list of factors that French companies take into account when choosing their suppliers.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
These factors were identified during the survey of a large number of companies.

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
Pay attention to the fact that the reputation of the company and its trust play a significant role here.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
Now let's move on to the analysis of the features and functional marketing strategies in the B2B market.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
The feature of the branding strategy is that the brand of the company plays a major role here,

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
not the brand of a specific product.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
The feature of the product strategy is that the highest role of the brand is played here.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
It should also be added that the introduction of new goods into the industrial market

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
is fundamentally different from the one in the consumer market.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
If a final buyer buys a new product,

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
he usually does so out of curiosity or to satisfy his psychological needs.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
The acquisition of a new product, technological innovation on the industrial market,

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
implies that the company can gain competitive advantage

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
by using the product when producing its own goods.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
Thus, the industrial buyer is ready to pay higher prices for new products.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
Therefore, the strategy of removing the cream is often used on the industrial market.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
It should also be noted that the most important thing for an industrial buyer

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
is the rational characteristics of the product.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
But it should not be forgotten that the decision-making of the purchase is made by people

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
who have their own emotional needs.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
What emotional needs can satisfy the members of the purchasing committee?

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
There are situations when, when purchasing is made,

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
the purchasing committee tries to satisfy its own needs

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
by assuming that the purchase is successful and the product is correctly selected.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
In addition, many employees need communication and friendly support.

54:07.000 --> 54:12.000
Therefore, a friendly shoulder of the sales manager is often a free offer to the industrial product.

54:12.000 --> 54:17.000
In addition, such a characteristic as a reduction of risk is important for industrial products.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
In order to satisfy the emotional need of the business buyer in reducing the risk,

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
because business purchases are really important for companies

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
and the risk of making a mistake is high,

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
the company must use different tools.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
Often, such guarantees are reviews of other buyers, received certificates, awards

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
and other awards.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
What are the features of the home strategy in the industrial market?

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
First, a direct channel is often used in the industrial market.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
In some cases, companies use both direct and indirect distribution channels.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
Another feature is that the industrial market

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
is often a place of high risk, because industrial goods usually have more complex characteristics

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
and require more post-sales service.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
What are the features of the price strategy?

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
As we have already said, the strategy of removing the cream is often used in the industrial market,

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
because more customers are ready to pay higher prices for new goods.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
This is due to the fact that there are usually fewer customers in the industrial market.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
If most of them purchase goods at a low price,

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
the company will not have the opportunity to compensate for this price reduction due to future sales.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
It is also necessary to understand that industrial buyers and members of the purchasing committee

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
are well aware of all offers on the market and the prices for these offers.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
Therefore, an industrial buyer has a much greater knowledge of prices

56:02.000 --> 56:07.000
than a consumer buyer.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
This reduces the price sensitivity.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
It is also necessary to note that a differentiated price formation is often used in the industrial market.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
In this case, it is easier to divide the segment of buyers and sell them goods with small modifications at different prices.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
This is due to the fact that companies do not always know

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
at what prices the final sale of industrial goods is carried out,

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
because these prices are significantly different from the price of the products on the market.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
It is also necessary to note the features of the price sensitivity factors in the industrial market.

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
Let's consider the first factor of price sensitivity â€“ the perceived substitutes.

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
If a buyer is aware of the presence of substitutes,

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
he will be more sensitive to the price.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
When the price is increased, for example, he will switch to a substitute, i.e. a competitor's product.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
If on the consumer market many buyers are not aware of the presence of alternative products,

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
then on the industrial market, as a rule, the awareness is quite high.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
If a company decides to increase prices,

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
it should understand that many business clients will switch to a competitor's product.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
On the other hand, the price sensitivity in the industrial market is reduced due to the effect of a unique value.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
It happens that the product is customized to the needs of a particular company,

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
and the company cannot switch to another supplier,

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
which is not a good thing.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
The price sensitivity is reduced by such a factor as the difficulty of comparison.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
If on the consumer market it is difficult for many buyers to compare alternative products

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
because they do not have sufficient knowledge,

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
on the industrial market, buyers, as a rule, have high qualifications and know the product well.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
The price-quality ratio on the industrial market works much weaker than on the consumer market.

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
If a consumer does not have enough information about the quality of a product,

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
cannot evaluate it due to insufficient knowledge,

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
if a consumer often cannot evaluate the quality of a product based on its technical characteristics,

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
this buyer can evaluate the quality of the product based on the price.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
On the industrial market, buyers are qualified enough to evaluate the quality objectively.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
They do not need to use prices as indicators of quality.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
There is also an effect of the level of consumption.

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
The higher the share of the consumer's consumption of a particular product, the higher the price sensitivity.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
While the end customer usually buys a large number of products of different categories,

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
the industrial buyer buys a small set of products.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
Therefore, it turns out that the share of the consumer's consumption of each product is high.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
Another factor is the division of costs.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
If the customer pays for his purchase, his price sensitivity is higher.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
If the payment is made by someone else, the price sensitivity is reduced.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
As on the industrial market, the decision of the purchase is made by members of the purchasing committee,

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
which does not spend their own money, it happens that their price sensitivity is reduced.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
It is also necessary to consider the effect of stocks.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
It is established that if a buyer can accumulate stocks of a particular product,

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
his price sensitivity will be higher.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
The second factor is the role of personal sales.

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
The role of personal sales is much higher on the industrial market than on the consumer market.

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
The distribution channel is used much more often.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It is necessary to understand that personal sales are not a product of the individual.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The individual is a product of the individual.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Therefore, the manager of the sales does not communicate with the business client.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The client does not know the reputation of the company.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The reputation of the company is not known.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The reputation of the company is not known.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The reputation of the company is known.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
The reputation of the company is not known.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
The reputation of the company is known.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The reputation of the company is known.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Now we will move on to the third section, which is related to the features of marketing on the service market,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
namely, the features of functional marketing strategies.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You have already seen the main features of decision-making on the acquisition of services in the General Marketing module.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Here we will consider the features of functional marketing strategies in the service sector.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We will consider the features of the marketing strategy.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
In this case, the reputation of the company is of particular importance.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Why does this happen?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The fact is that the client who acquires a service cannot assess its quality in advance.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
In addition, it is very difficult to compare the quality of different services, that is, the quality of the services of different suppliers.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
In this regard, the risk of the buyer increases, and it is necessary to consider any factors that would reduce the uncertainty.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
How can a company help to reduce this uncertainty?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
How can a company improve its image?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
In the service sector, the image of the company's head is often used.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
In addition, companies in the service sector can participate in various professional associations,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
especially if it concerns services in the B2B sphere.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Next, we will consider the features of the product strategy.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
There is a concept of materialization of services.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Why is this materialization of services carried out?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
There is a pattern that the more material the product is, the more emotional and non-material characteristics are used in its promotion.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And vice versa, the more material the product is, the more materialization is necessary.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
How can the materialization of services be carried out?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
First, a company can use customer feedback.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Also, many companies in the service sector have gorgeous offices

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
to materialize their services and create a reason for the customer to assume that the services are of high quality.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Many companies in the service sector use their customers' lists to confirm their services.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
In addition, it is very important to provide a photo of the customer,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
which tells about how the process of providing services is carried out,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
what kind of people provide services.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
In the slide, you can see an example of how a company providing a service of chemical cleaning

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
carries out the materialization of its services.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You can see that the colored circles are the factors that reflect the materialization.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
In this case, the factors of materialization are the cleanliness of the product,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
the packaging of the product, the room itself, where the chemical cleaning orders are made,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
as well as the quality of the product and the accuracy of its filling.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
These aspects allow the customer to draw a conclusion about the quality of the service provided,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
because the customer may not always appreciate the quality of the service,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
especially if it is a professional service.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Now let's look at the features of the price strategy in the service sector.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
The fact is that many companies providing services have high constant costs,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
but at the same time they have low variable costs.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
The cost of service for each new customer is quite low.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
At the same time, in this case, it is very important for the company to have a large sales volume,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
that is, for the company to serve as many customers as possible.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
In this case, there is such a risk.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
The company understands that in order to compensate for the large amount of constant costs,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
the price is often reduced.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
As the companies compete, the price is reduced more and more,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
resulting in price wars.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
As a result, the companies will balance on the verge of maximum costs

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and will not receive enough profit.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The first factor is the perceived substitute.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The fact is that the quality of the service cannot be standardized,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
so the customer may not perceive the services of another company as similar.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Thus, a situation may arise when the customer does not see an alternative to the services of a certain company.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
In this case, its price sensitivity will be low,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
that is, when the price is increased, the customer will not use the services of another company.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Now let's consider the effect of price sensitivity as the effect of a unique value.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Since in fact each service is unique,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
the price sensitivity of the customer who purchases the service will be quite low.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Now let's consider such a factor as the difficulty of comparison.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It is very difficult to compare the quality of different services.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Moreover, it is almost impossible to compare the quality of different services until the moment of providing the service.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Therefore, the price sensitivity of the customer in this case will be low,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
because the customer cannot compare the quality of the service he is using now

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and the quality of the service of another supplier.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Again, due to the fact that the customer cannot compare the quality of the services

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and has little information about the quality of the services,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
many customers begin to focus on the prices,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
assuming that the services with higher prices have higher quality.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
As for the effect of supply, it is quite obvious that the services cannot be stored.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Therefore, if a company reduces the price of its services,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
it is impossible to expect that customers will create their stocks.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
In this case, it affects the price sensitivity in a negative way,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
that is, the price sensitivity will also be low.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Thus, we can conclude that in general,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
the cost of the services will be very low.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
As for the communication strategy,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
it is extremely important to provide information about certain material characteristics of the service,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
that is, to materialize.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
A study was conducted, in which the content of advertising messages about goods and services was studied

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and it was found that the characteristics of the services were mentioned much more often

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
than the guarantees, the price of the services and the territorial availability.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
In the case of advertising of goods,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
these characteristics were mentioned much less often.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
As for the household strategy,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
it is impossible to sell through indirect channels, that is, through intermediaries.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, a direct channel is used for the sale of services.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
In this case, the special importance is given to the qualifications of the household staff,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that is, the managers for the sale of services.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It is also necessary to note the following features of marketing in the service sphere.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The most important thing is the quality of the service.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
The quality of the service is more important than the quality of the goods.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It is necessary to emphasize the importance of internal marketing,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
because the direct distribution channel is used.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Thus, the face of the company becomes its household staff.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
If the services of a company are at risk,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
they often refuse to switch and maintain the loyalty of the same company.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
As we have already said, the reputation and image of the company are of fundamental importance for the service sphere.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Now let's compare the features of marketing in the B2B and service spheres.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Here we can see some common points.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
First, in both cases, the face of the company is its staff.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
In the case of the sale of industrial goods, the face of the company is the sales manager.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
In the case of sales of services, the face of the company is the staff who directly provides services.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Therefore, internal marketing, both in the B2B market and in the service sphere,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
has a fundamental importance.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It is important that the staff of the company is aware of the mission of the company,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
its corporate strategy and the main principles of the marketing strategy.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Also, the common point is that marketing in the B2B and service spheres

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
is focused on long-term relations with the client.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
In the service sphere and in the B2B sphere, marketing of relations is more and more often used.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The greater loyalty of the company's clients and the dependence of the client on the company and the company on the client

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
is also characteristic for both the service sphere and the B2B sphere.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
You can also notice that the reputation of the company is an important point.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
The reputation of the company is important both in the industrial market and in the service sphere.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Summing up, it is necessary to emphasize that when developing functional marketing strategies,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
the company should use an integrated approach.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It is important that the functional marketing strategies do not contradict each other,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that they have a common goal and lead to a single strategy of positioning the company.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
If within the framework of some functional strategy, the company is not able to meet the needs of the client,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
the changes should be made to other functional strategies.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
As a result, these changes should lead to a correction of the marketing strategy of the company as a whole.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Pay attention to the model of integrated marketing communications presented on the slide.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Here you can see that the sources of messages for the clients are the following.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The first is the user-oriented communication.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Here you can see that the sources of messages for the clients are not only the communication strategy.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
First of all, marketing communication channels should provide a single message.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Messages from different channels should not contradict each other.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It is necessary to emphasize that the product, its distribution system and the price of the product

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
are also the sources of certain messages for the client.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
The price of the product is also the source of certain messages for the client.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And the essence of these messages should be one.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
These messages should not contradict each other.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
If you look at the top of this scheme, you will see that the sources of messages for the clients are not only the marketing strategy,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
but also other branches, such as top management, production, finance and management of staff,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and all messages coming from any area of the company's activities should have an integrated nature.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The client should not feel that he receives various messages from different sources.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
In this case, the positioning of the company will be blurred.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Thank you for your attention. I wish you good luck in your studies.
